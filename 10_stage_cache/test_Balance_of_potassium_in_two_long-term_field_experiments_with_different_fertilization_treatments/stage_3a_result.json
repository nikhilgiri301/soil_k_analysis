    "research_scope_authority": "The paper provides authoritative insights into long-term potassium (K) dynamics and balance in agricultural soils under various fertilization regimes. Its 21-year duration (1996-2017) at two distinct sites lends strong authority to conclusions regarding multi-decadal trends and the sustainability of different K management practices.",
    "methodological_rigor": "The study employs a rigorous experimental design with long-term field experiments and multiple fertilization treatments. It utilizes a comprehensive suite of analytical methods for soil K (Mehlich 3, NH4OAc, CAT, boiling HNO3) to characterize different K pools (bioavailable, exchangeable, non-exchangeable). Statistical analyses (ANOVA, Pearson's correlation) are applied to assess treatment effects and relationships between K forms, indicating a robust approach to data interpretation.",
    "geographic_representativeness": "The findings are directly representative of two specific agricultural sites in the Czech Republic: Hněvčeves (Luvisol on loess) and Humpolec (Cambisol on paragneiss). These sites represent distinct soil types and parent materials, allowing for comparative analysis of K dynamics under different geological influences. Extrapolation beyond these specific soil and climate conditions should be done with caution.",
    "temporal_representativeness": "The research covers a significant 21-year period (1996-2017), providing strong temporal representativeness for long-term trends in soil K pools and balances. It is particularly authoritative for understanding the cumulative effects of fertilization strategies over two decades, rather than short-term or seasonal fluctuations.",
    "measurement_precision": "The study uses established analytical methods for soil K, contributing to reliable measurements. While generally precise, the validation process identified minor numerical discrepancies (e.g., initial extraction of Kne ranges vs. abstract averages) and unit ambiguities (e.g., total K by HNO3 in mg K/ha vs. mg K/kg), which have been addressed in the corrected data. Statistical significance is reported for key findings, enhancing confidence in observed differences.",
    "experimental_control": "The study is based on well-controlled long-term field experiments with defined fertilization treatments (Control, FYM 1, FYM 1/2, N, NPK, N + St). This allows for direct attribution of observed changes in soil K to specific management practices, providing high experimental authority.",
    "literature_positioning": "This paper significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge on long-term soil K dynamics, particularly by providing empirical data from extended field experiments. It reinforces the understanding of K balance as a critical indicator for soil K sustainability and highlights the differential buffering capacities of various soil types (e.g., Luvisol vs. Cambisol) in managing K depletion/accumulation.",
    "authority_limitations": [
      "The study's findings are geographically limited to two specific sites in the Czech Republic, restricting direct extrapolation to other regions with different soil types, climates, or agricultural systems.",
      "While long-term trends are well-covered, the study does not explicitly detail seasonal or short-term K dynamics.",
      "Initial data extraction errors (e.g., 'Potassium saturation in CEC' hallucination, incorrect trend magnitude for Kex) necessitated corrections, indicating a need for careful verification of derived data points.",
      "The generalization of a specific significance level (P < 0.001) in the original extraction was imprecise and has been corrected to apply only to the specific correlation where it was reported."
