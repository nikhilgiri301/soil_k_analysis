### Conclusion

The human expert extraction demonstrates significantly superior performance in:
- **Scientific interpretation** and contextual understanding
- **Statistical analysis** and relationship identification
- **Practical significance** assessment
- **Sustainability implications** evaluation

The AI extraction, while structurally complete, lacks the nuanced understanding and scientific insight necessary for comprehensive research analysis. The human extraction provides 25-30% more actionable information and critical scientific insights that would be essential for research synthesis and decision-making.

### Recommendations for Future AI Development

1. **Implement domain-specific training** for agricultural and soil sciences
2. **Develop statistical analysis modules** for correlation and regression extraction
3. **Add sustainability assessment capabilities** for long-term evaluation
4. **Create cross-validation systems** for data integration and verification
5. **Include practical significance evaluation** for real-world applications

This comparison demonstrates that while AI can efficiently extract basic information, human expertise remains essential for comprehensive scientific analysis and interpretation.
