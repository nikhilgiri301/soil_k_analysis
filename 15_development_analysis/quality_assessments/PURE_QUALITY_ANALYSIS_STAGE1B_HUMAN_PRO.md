- **Numerical precision**: Correct K depletion rates (-205 kg K/ha for exchangeable K)
- **Proper attribution**: Every data point correctly referenced to source tables and text
- **Scientific integrity**: 98% confidence in extraction accuracy with self-documented validation

**Quality Examples:**
```json
{
  "parameter": "K recovery rate from farmyard manure",
  "values": [24, 26],
  "statistical_measures": {
    "mean": 25,
    "sample_size": 2
  },
  "measurement_context": "Overall recovery across both sites over 21 years"
}
```

### **Stage 1B Validation (High Quality with Corrections)**
- **Error detection**: Successfully identified 3 critical accuracy issues in Pro output
- **Data verification**: Systematic checking against source material
- **Correction framework**: Provided specific fixes for numerical and attribution errors
- **Quality assurance**: Conservative validation approach with business-grade reliability

**Quality Examples:**
```json
{
  "numerical_accuracy": {
    "verification_status": false,
    "discrepancies_found": [
      "The 'trend_magnitude' for 'Bioavailable K' was extracted as -332 kg K/ha. The original text states -205 kg K/ha specifically for exchangeable K at the N variant at Humpolec."
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Pro Revised (Poor Quality)**
- **Data hallucination**: Fabricated K saturation values (4.56%, 4.37%) from non-existent "Table 4"
- **Numerical errors**: 62% overestimation of K depletion rates (-332 vs -205 kg K/ha)
- **Attribution failures**: Incorrect source referencing throughout
- **No quality validation**: Unable to detect its own errors

**Quality Problems:**
```json
{
  "parameter": "Potassium saturation in CEC",
  "values": [{"site": "Hněvčeves", "average": 4.56}],
  "measurement_context": "Table 4. Average values across all treatments"
  // Table 4 does not exist in source material
