# Critical Gaps in AI Extraction Performance
## Detailed Analysis of Missed Information and Errors

### 1. Major Statistical Relationships Missed by AI

#### **Correlation Analysis Between K Extraction Methods**
**AI Missed Completely:**
```
- Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.989 (Hněvčeves, P < 0.001)
- Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.958 (Humpolec, P < 0.001)
- Regression equation (Hněvčeves): y = 0.974x + 7.6145, R² = 0.9772
- Regression equation (Humpolec): y = 0.9505x + 5.6757, R² = 0.9815
```

**Scientific Significance:** These correlations validate analytical precision and indicate that Mehlich-3 and NH4OAc methods extract primarily exchangeable K. This is crucial for method comparison and soil testing interpretation.

**Why AI Missed:** Failed to recognize statistical relationships embedded in text rather than explicitly tabulated.

#### **Dose-Response Relationships**
**AI Missed:**
- Inverse relationship between fertilizer dose and utilization efficiency
- Site-specific response patterns
- Threshold effects for K utilization

**Human Captured:**
- Lower doses show higher utilization efficiency
- Site-specific K sorption capacity affects utilization
- Critical thresholds for positive K balance

### 2. Quantitative Data Extraction Gaps

| K balance | Individual values | Trend analysis, sustainability assessment |
| Recovery rates | Basic percentages | Efficiency comparisons, economic implications |

#### **Missing Derived Calculations**
**AI Failed to Calculate:**
- K balance per year averages

- Policy implications for sustainable K management

### 6. Data Integration and Cross-Validation Failures
