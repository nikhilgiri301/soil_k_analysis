  "significance_level": "P < 0.001",
  "variables": ["Mehlich-3 K", "NH4OAc K"],
  "site": "Hněvčeves"
}
```

**Human Captured Complete Analysis:**

    {
      "coefficient": 0.989,
      "significance": "P < 0.001",
      "variables": ["Mehlich-3 K", "NH4OAc extractable K"],
      "site": "Hněvčeves",
      "regression": "y = 0.974x + 7.6145",
      "r_squared": 0.9772
    },
    {
      "coefficient": 0.958,
      "significance": "P < 0.001",

### Conclusion

The quantitative data extraction comparison reveals a **significant quality gap** between AI and human expert performance:

- **Basic Data:** AI performs adequately (85% accuracy)
- **Statistical Analysis:** AI fails dramatically (15% completeness)
- **Integration:** AI severely limited (10% cross-validation)
- **Practical Utility:** AI inadequate for research synthesis

**Key Finding:** While AI can extract basic numerical values efficiently, it fundamentally lacks the analytical capabilities needed for comprehensive quantitative research analysis. The human expert extraction provides 3-4x more usable quantitative information and is essential for meaningful research synthesis and practical application.

**Bottom Line:** Current AI extraction is suitable for basic data collection but requires significant human enhancement for research-grade quantitative analysis.
