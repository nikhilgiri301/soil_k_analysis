# Gold Standard Architecture Prompt Audit Documentation

## Audit Overview
**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Scope**: Systematic manual audit of all Gold Standard Architecture prompts (Stages 5, 6, 7 = 14 prompts total)  
**Objective**: Remove business-oriented content while preserving scientific synthesis focus  

## Surgical Guidance Applied
### üö® CRITICAL IMPERATIVE: MANUAL INTERPRETATION ONLY
- NO SHORTCUTS: Interpretation-based, not rule-based
- MANUAL READING: Every sentence read and understood in full context
- NO WORD SEARCHES for decisions: Context determines actions
- INTERPRET THEN ACT: Understand AI task, then decide

### Content Categories
**KEEP (‚úÖ)**: Scientific intelligence, model integration, research priorities, agricultural context, scientific implementation  
**REMOVE (‚ùå)**: Business applications, investment decisions, prescriptive management advice, business planning  
**CONTEXT-DEPENDENT**: K management guidance, implementation approaches, applications

## Temporal Synthesis Audit

### Stage 5A Temporal Synthesis
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Issues Identified**: Lines 333-361 "actionable_temporal_intelligence" section analyzed  
**Context Analysis**: 
- Line 340 "implementation_timeline" - Scientific temporal guidance, not business implementation
- Lines 352-360 "temporal_management_guidance" - Scientific intelligence about temporal K patterns (when depletion occurs, decision points, etc.), not prescriptive management advice
- Line 376 "long-term planning and management" - Creating scientific knowledge for planning, not doing planning
- Line 382 "Support temporal decision-making" - Providing scientific confidence levels, not making decisions
- Line 390 "practical agricultural planning" - Serving agriculture with science, not doing planning
**Changes Made**: NONE - All content determined to be scientific temporal intelligence about soil K dynamics
**Rationale**: Entire prompt focused on temporal biogeochemical synthesis. The "management guidance" section provides scientific intelligence about temporal patterns (timescales, decision points, sustainability milestones) rather than prescriptive advice  

### Stage 5B Temporal Validation
