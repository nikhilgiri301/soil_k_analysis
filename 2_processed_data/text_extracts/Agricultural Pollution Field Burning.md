### **Why Care about Agricultural Burning?**

The practice of burning unwanted vegetation to prepare land for sowing crops or other farming activities
is a worldwide and long-standing practice. Its tenacity,
despite its harmful consequences for air quality, soil
health, and the climate is a testament to its convenience
and acceptance among farmers across a wide range of
farming systems and agroclimatic zones. Burning is so
broadly perceived as being natural that even its immediate toxicity is generally overlooked. Overall, there is
no greater source of primary fine carbonaceous particles
than biomass burning, and it is the second largest source
of trace gases in the atmosphere. Yet while the polluting
effects of burning are seldom a concern of agricultural
producers, the act of burning often defies farmers’ own
understanding of the multiple benefits of biomass residues, which include nourishing and improving soils.
That said, the embrace in the past two decades of alternatives such as no-till farming on a fairly wide scale
in parts of Europe, Asia, and especially the Americas,
demonstrates that change is possible with the right mix
of public sector support and regulation.

### **Nature and Magnitude of the Problem**

Around the globe, in farming systems large and small,
burning is one of the most commonly used methods for
removing crop residues after harvest. It is particularly
prevalent following the cultivation of maize, but is also
practiced with rice, wheat, sugar cane, and other crops
(see figure 2). Burning is also a common way of preparing lands for cultivation after they have been fallowed.
In aggregate terms, China, India, and the United
States are the top burners of crop residues, followed by
Brazil, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation. In relative
terms, however, Africa is home to some of the most intensive rates of residue burning per hectare of harvested
land. It is also the region where burning is growing the
fastest. Among the top 20 burners (in aggregate terms),
Mexico and Tanzania stand out as the most intensive

burners, followed by Brazil, the United States, and Nigeria. And over the past decades, burning has progressed
significantly in countries including Brazil, Indonesia,
Thailand, India, and China (see figure 3). [1]

To put the above in perspective, however, crop resi

due burning represents only a small fraction of overall,
agriculture-related open burning of biomass (see box 1
and figures 4, 5 and 6). With regard to black carbon contributions, for instance, the burning of crop residues is
estimated to represent only around 5 percent of overall
open burning emissions (Bond et al. 2013).2 This note
focuses primarily on crop residue burning because it is
unambiguously related to agriculture, and represents a
significant pollution abatement opportunity.

### **Impacts**

The open burning of biomass releases a range of air
pollutants that are known to contribute to the deterioration of air quality. This has especially harmful effects
on human health and negatively affects crop growth,
natural ecosystems, visibility (due to haze), and physical
infrastructure. The key pollutant from a human health
perspective is particulate matter (coarse particles of 2.5
to 10 microns, and fine particles of 2.5 microns or less),
the impacts of which are mostly local and modulated by
its concentration, by population density and exposure,
and weather conditions. Other local air pollutants that
result from biomass burning include carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen
oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH 3 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ),
carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), and multiple other toxic compounds. Short- and

long-term exposures to particulate matter and air pollutants more generally are strongly associated with a
range of health responses including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and premature death.
In crops, ground level ozone (formed when NOx, CO,
and VOCs react with sunlight) can reduce photosynthesis and prohibit plant growth. Acid rain resulting from
the emission of SOplants, affect soils, and corrode urban structures. 2 and NOx is also known to damage
Biomass burning also releases several climate pollutants, including the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon
dioxide (COand fine particles known as black carbon. The effects of 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and methane (CH 4 ), [3]
these and other co-emitted species on climate are variable and complex. [4] Schematically, however, there are
two major and unambiguous ways in which biomass
burning contributes to climate change. One is a longterm warming effect linked primarily to CO 2 emissions,
though also to other GHGs, from deforestation and other forms of land conversion during which biomass is
burnt and not fully replaced. The other is a short-term
warming effect attributed to the emission of black carbon from the burning of biomass in relative proximity to
snow- and ice-covered regions of the planet (see box 2).
In addition to polluting, the burning of biomass
amounts to destroying a resource that can be put to valu

nutrients to the soil and can even

result in a burst of fertility in the
short run, most of the organic material and nutrient content of straw is lost under high temperatures. Burning,
meanwhile, can perturb soil pH, moisture, and biota (for
example, bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, earthworms,
arthropods, and termites), resulting in imbalances. Beyond the farm gate, renouncing the recycling of biomass

The burning of “renewable biomass” is generally considered carbon neutral. Even though it can influence the climate for
years before it is resequestered, the CO2 emitted in burning biomass is not considered a contributor to long-term climate change
if the equivalent biomass is regrown, as in crop farming. Burning-related emissions of CH4 and N2O—GHGs that are respectively 25 and 298 times more potent than CO2—do contribute to radiative forcing even when the burnt biomass is replaced;
however, biomass burning-related emissions of these gases are dwarfed by other global sources. Note that burning has also
been found to increase biogenic soil emissions of CH4, N2O, and nitric oxide (NO)—that is, linked to soil microbial activity.
The emission of pure black carbon has a potent and immediate (“near-term”) warming effect on the climate. Depending on its
source, however, its warming effect can be countered by co-emitted species such as organic carbon, which can have a cooling
effect. As a result, the net, near-term effect of burning-related emissions on climate depends on a complex set of circumstances,
including where burning occurs (box 2).

**Box 1.** What Is
Agricultural Burning?


Agricultural burning refers to any
open-air burning of biomass that
is driven by agriculture and results
from fires set intentionally in
preparation for farming activities.
Although this is conceptually
straightforward, the challenge
of empirically establishing
this causal relationship makes
agricultural burning exceedingly
difficult to define in practice, as
well as to measure. Whereas
the burning of agricultural
crop residues squarely fits the
definition, other forms of open
burning of biomass, including
the combustion of forests,
grasslands, and savannah, cannot
all be traced to agriculture. A
small minority of wildfires are
provoked by natural causes
such as lightning, for instance,
and planned agricultural fires
account for “only” 10–20 percent
of open burning (ICCI 2014).
The vast majority of open
burning is believed to result
from the uncontrolled spread of
agricultural fires.

ter pollution linked to soil erosion or the additional use
of synthetic fertilizers for instance.5 Other valuable uses
of straw precluded by burning include its use for energy, feed, construction materials, or bioplastics. The value
of using biomass in these and other cases comes from
displacing other sources of these (such as energy or materials) and associated externalities. In other words, the
impact of burning is to not prevent these externalities.

### **Drivers**


Burning patterns in the Andes and Himalayas were
found to reflect multiple factors, and especially tradition,
ease, timing, weather and location, and the practicality
of alternatives—the latter being partly determined by
access to appropriate tools or markets for biomass residues. Across regions, burning is widely seen as a quick
and inexpensive way to manage crop residues while preventing pests and diseases. And burning crop residues
can indeed be a rapid way to prepare fields for a second
or third crop—an aspect that matters in certain farming
contexts, where time and labor constraints factor into



farming decisions. In parts of China, for example, there
is a short window of typically one to two weeks for the
removal of crop residues between harvests. Burning is
often the preferred method of land preparation in such
cases. In Russia, a sharp rise in residue burning has been
linked to the virtual collapse, since the 1990s, of the country’s livestock sector along with its appetite for stubble.
In general, while the cost-benefit reality of burning
varies significantly and depends on many factors, burning is widespread because so many farmers perceive it
to offer multiple benefits—and presumably ones that
outweigh its costs. At the same time, farmers’ favorable
perception of burning is partly owed to the fact that they
do not factor in the environmental and health costs of
burning that are felt off-farm—its negative externalities. Meanwhile, in contexts where bans or regulations
on burning are in place, weak enforcement means that
there is little disincentive for farmers to carry on with
the practice.
In parallel, a lack of awareness (that is, a partial
awareness of the costs and benefits of burning and its

them purchase or lease the equipment or inputs that are
required. Investment can be further hampered by insecure land tenure, as seen in much of Sub-Saharan Africa
and parts of Asia. Farmers also often lack the technical
knowledge and know-how to adopt alternatives, and in
certain contexts, collective action or markets are insufficiently developed to help farmers overcome some of
these obstacles.

In addition, culturally produced mental models, social customs, present bias, procrastination, and other sociopsychological factors can play a role in perpetuating
long-held practices. Burning, for example, can be held
in place by the notion that crop residues are a form of
waste, rather than a resource, and the customary belief that burning is the least costly way of removing a
cumbersome waste stream. The idea that crop residues
are a waste stream can also minimize the feeling of loss
associated with burning. The central place of plowing,
in many farmers’ concept of land-preparation can deter their adoption of residue management practices that
do not involve burning (box 3). A tendency to discount
future gains and losses known as present bias can also
interfere. In other words, farmers may pursue the shortterm boost in soil fertility that burning offers, even
while knowing full well that soils suffer from high temperatures, the loss of organic matter, and the excessive
amounts of fertilizer that are often applied in compensation. And like all humans, farmers can simply procrastinate, intending to change practices but never actually
implementing the change.

### **What Can Be Done?**


There are multiple alternatives to burning, many of
which can be directly valuable to farmers. [6] Staying focused on crop residue burning—the broader question of
open burning being beyond the scope of this note—major alternatives involve repurposing residues as ground
cover, soil amendments (that is, mulch or compost), animal feed, or as feedstock for energy, [7] construction materials, paper products, bioplastics, and other artifacts. All
of these can take on different forms, scales, and levels of
sophistication. They can also take place on- or off-farm,
with the latter relying on the aggregation of residues
from multiple farms to achieve economies of scale. Offfarm solutions can also involve larger upfront investments, as well as additional costs and complexities associated with moving product around. At the front end,
residues need to be collected from multiple farms, and

at the back end, their byproducts distributed—processes that can involve varying degrees of commodification
and market transacting.
Helping any of these become a reality, rests first and
foremost on supporting the technical feasibility and
economic attractiveness of alternatives to burning. Yet
it also requires that the full range of drivers and barriers be addressed, including hidden costs of switching
practices, farmer perceptions of crop residues and different possible uses of these, and such factors as present
bias, action-intention divides, and even sociocultural
constructs (that is, mental models or schemas). Thus, a
range of instruments are needed to support alternatives
to burning.
**Laws and regulations.** Through legal action, burning can be restricted or outright banned. Several U.S.
states, for example, use a permitting system to limit
burning to specific days, times, and atmospheric condi


**6**
Besides alternative uses of biomass, increased combustion efficiency can also reduce burning-related pollution (especially
particulates). Meanwhile, reducing the amount of residues that are generated in the first place, while theoretically possible,
offers more limited options in practice. That said, reducing land clearing is a highly relevant though much larger topic that
requires addressing the complex drivers of deforestation.
**7** The use of crop residues to generate useful energy (for example, biogas, or fuel used in cement production) can mitigate
burning-related pollution to the extent that burning can occur in more controlled conditions, thus resulting in lower particulate
and methane emissions. Beyond this, its main benefit is to displace other forms of energy production and any pollutants associated with these.

tions; and the burning of straw and stubble is outlawed
in most of the European Union’s member states. Many
have been able to manage or curb burning in this way,
but evidently, legal action there and elsewhere has varied in effectiveness. In China and Russia, national and
subnational bans on burning have yielded particularly
limited results. The efficacy of legal measures generally
rests on multiple nonlegal measures and circumstances,
including efforts to make the law known to farmers, a
rule-abiding culture, the capacity to detect and punish
illicit burning, and not least, the alignment of economic incentives and other motivators with the law. Several
U.S. states use a combination of fines, aerial photography, remote sensing, and tip hotlines for enforcement.
**Information, knowledge, and innovation** . Various
forms of information and knowledge are needed to curb
open burning. They are needed to support an understanding of, among others: the costs and benefits (both
public and private) of burning and its alternatives; the
existence and extent of these; legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to them; where, when, and why
burning is carried out (satellite detection can help up
to a point); and how to implement alternatives (that is,
technical information). Where farmers’ beliefs about the
benefits of burning—or conversely, the inconveniences

of not burning—are deeply rooted, and even socially
or culturally reinforced, information alone may or may
not counter these where they stand to be rectified. The
above underscores the need for multidirectional flows of
knowledge and information, as well as the importance of
how information is framed and delivered. It also points

to the need for a multiplicity of actors, including but not
limited to traditional agricultural extension and advisory services, to be connected and engaged in generating
and conveying information, knowledge, and technology
to support alternatives to burning (see box 3). Without
robust information and innovation systems in place, efforts to curb open burning are likely to be in vain.
**Sticks, carrots, and nudges** . In the Andes prior to the
arrival of the Spanish and the introduction of the plow,
the practice of burning fields carried a penalty of death
because it damaged the soil, the lifeblood of high agricultural yields, reports a 2015 report by the International
Cryosphere Climate Initiative. Today, gentler approaches to advocacy and enforcement are more in vogue—instruments such as fines, taxes, subsidies, and behavioral
interventions known as nudges that ultimately let farmers decide for themselves. Whether or not they accompany legal action, these instruments can be used to correct
externalities (that is, to expose farmers to the full costs



and benefits of burning and its alternatives), and even
to overcome sociopsychological barriers. For example, if
it can be detected, burning can carry a fine, and alternative uses such as no-till, composting, and biogas production can be encouraged through concessional credit
(for example, for the production or purchase of equipment), tax incentives (for example, for compost or biogas
production), and supportive public investments. The effectiveness of different instruments is highly contextual
and can be unrelated to their cost. The convenience of a

residue pickup service, the persuasiveness of a community-based enforcement system, or even the influence of
role models, may be more effective at dissuading burning than a cash incentive or fine. In sum, the complexity,
persistence, and context specificity of the burning challenge needs to be mirrored by patient forms of public
sector support that enable technological as well as social
innovation—involving, serving, and motivating stakeholders at every level.
