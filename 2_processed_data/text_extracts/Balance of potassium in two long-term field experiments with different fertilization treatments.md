with different fertilization treatments. Plant Soil Environ, 65: 225–232.


**Abstract** : Balance of potassium (K) was observed in long-term stationary field experiments (21 years) at two sites with
different soil and climatic conditions (Luvisol, Cambisol). The following crops were rotated within the trial: potatoeswinter wheat-spring barley. All three crops were grown each year. The trial comprised 6 treatments: (1) no fertilization;
(2) farmyard manure; (3) half dose of farmyard manure + nitrogen (N) in mineral nitrogen fertilizers; (4) mineral
nitrogen fertilizers; (5) NPK in mineral fertilizers; (6) straw of spring barley + N in mineral nitrogen fertilizers. The
recovery rate of potassium from farmyard manure by crops was 24–26%, from mineral fertilizers it was 27–52%.
Different fertilization intensities were manifested by significant differences in the content of exchangeable K in soil.
Changes in non-exchangeable K (K ne ) were recorded only at the Luvisol site (850 mg K ne /kg), but not at the Cam­
bisol site (3000 mg K ne /kg). The maximum negative balance (–2376 kg K/ha/21 years) was recorded at the mineral
nitrogen fertilization treatment.

The total potassium (K) content in soils is in the
range 0.01% to 4% and usually oscillates around
ca 1%. To determine the optimum content of bio­
available K in soil, various methods may be used.
In past, it was especially the Egner-Riehm method
(Egnér et al. 1960). In the Czech Republic, the official
method for agricultural soils analyses nowadays is
the Mehlich 3 method (Mehlich 1984, Madaras and
Lipavský 2009, Schroder et al. 2009, Kulhánek et
al. 2014, Madaras and Koubová 2015). Binner et al.
(2017) used the CaCl 2 /DTPA (CAT) extraction to
determine the optimum content of bioavailable K in
soil; yet, this method is suitable mostly for garden
substrates analyses. To determine exchangeable po­
tassium (K ex ), 1 mol/L ammonium acetate solution
was used (Blake et al. 1999, Liu et al. 2010, Madaras
et al. 2014). However, plants do not uptake only po­
tassium from the soil solution and exchangeable K.
They are able to absorb also some part of the non


exchangeable K (K ne ) (Hinsinger and Jaillard 1993).
In the plant rhizosphere, a zone poor in K is formed.
As a consequence, plants excrete H [+] to the rhizos­
phere (Steingrobe and Claasen 2000), which results
in release of non-exchangeable K. To determine
non-exchangeable K, boiling 1 mol/L HNO 3 ex­
traction is often used followed by subtracting of
NH OAc-determined K from the obtained values
4 (ex)
(Srinivasarao et al. 2014, Das et al. 2018, Kitagawa
et al. 2018). As reported by Liu and Bates (1990),
the content of non-exchangeable K provides good
information about the amount of plant-available K.
A significant positive correlation with fixed am­
monium ion strongly supports the hypothesis that
non-exchangeable K is bound mainly at boundaries
of the clay minerals of the 2:1 types, mica and ver­
miculite (Brouder 2011). The fact that a significant
correlation was not determined between the content

of non-exchangeable K and clay particles supports

the hypothesis that the clay mineral type is more
important than the total content of clay particles
(Kitagawa et al. 2018). The authors further suggest
determining not only exchangeable K but also nonexchangeable K, which enables a complex view of
the potassium issue, especially at insufficient K fer­
tilization (risk management) and resulting K deficit
in agricultural soils.

The aim of this study is to determine the potassium
balance and related changes in soils at different ferti­
lization treatments. Long-term field experiments were
carried out at two different sites. The crop rotation used
in the experiment corresponds well with the intensive
farming systems used in the Czech Republic (CR).
This research is also important from the viewpoint
of the long-term sustainable soil management in CR,
with respect to the fact that annual potassium doses
in mineral fertilizers for more than 20 years have been
only 5–6 kg K/ha agricultural soil.


**MATERIAL AND METHODS**


The trials were established in 1996 at two sites

with different soil-climatic conditions: Hněvčeves

and Humpolec (Table 1). Within the trials, three
crops were rotated in the following order: potatoes,
winter wheat, spring barley. Each year all of the crops
were grown. The trial comprised 6 treatments: (1) no
fertilization (control); (2) farmyard manure (FYM 1);
(3) half dose of farmyard manure + nitrogen (N) in
mineral nitrogen fertilizers (FYM 1/2); (4) mineral
nitrogen fertilizers (N); (5) NPK in mineral fertiliz­
ers (NPK); (6) straw of spring barley + N in mineral
nitrogen fertilizers (N + ST) (Černý et al. 2010).
Organic fertilizers – farmyard manure and straw (ST)
were always applied in autumn (October) to potatoes.
Mineral phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were
applied to each crop in autumn; mineral nitrogen
fertilizers were applied to potatoes and spring barley
in spring prior to the crop establishment. In the case
of winter wheat, the nitrogen dose was divided into
halves, the first one was applied at BBCH 21, the
second one at BBCH 31–32. The application rate
of mineral nitrogen was 140 kg N/ha for wheat and
70 kg N/ha for spring barley; at FYM 1/2 treatment,
N was applied at the rate of 115 kg N/ha for wheat
and 50 kg N/ha for barley. The NPK treatment of
winter wheat and spring barley included phosphorus
at a rate of 30 kg P/ha (triple super phosphate) and
potassium at a rate of 100 kg K/ha (60% potassium
salt). At the other treatments, the dosage of phospho­

rus (P) and K depended on the content of nutrients
in the applied organic fertilizers (Table 2).

Soil analyses were always proceeded with air-dried
soil samples (≤ 2 mm; 0–30 cm depth; four replica­
tions). For the purposes of this manuscript, soil
samples taken up in the year 1996 were analysed in
detail (autumn, before experiment establishing) and
at the end of 7 [th] crop rotation, shortly after plant
harvest in 2017. The data evaluated here are based

only on the results of the soils taken up from the
plots with spring barley.

All plants were harvested after reaching the maturity
stage every year of the experiment to get the yield
data. Samples of barley and wheat grain and straw as
well as potato tubers were dried at 40°C and subse­
quently proceeded with dry decomposition (Mader et
al. 1998). The potassium content was measured due
to the atomic adsorption spectrometry (AA280FS,
Agilent Technologies, Mulgrave, Australia).

CaCl 2 /DTPA (CAT) extraction (CSN EN 13651, 2001).
For this procedure, 3.00 g of soil sample was weighed
into 50 mL tubes. To all samples was applied 30 mL
solution of 0.01 mol/L CaCl and 0.01 mol/L 0.002
2
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). The solu­
tion was shaken for 1 h on a horizontal shaker. Extracts
were filtered and measured on the optical emission
spectrometer with inductive coupled plasma (ICPOES, Agilent Technologies 700, Victoria, Australia).

Mehlich 3 extraction (Mehlich 1984). The amount of
3.00 g of soil sample was extracted with 30 mL solu­
tion of 0.02 mol/L CH 3 COOH, 0.25 mol/L NH 4 NO 3,
0.015 mol/L NH 4 F, 0.013 mol/L HNO 3, 0.001 mol/L
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The solu­
tion was shaken for 5 min on a horizontal shaker and

subsequently filtered. Potassium content in extracts
was measured by the ICP-OES.

Ammonium acetate extraction (hereinafter NH 4 OAc)
was realized due to modified procedure by Haby et
al. (1990). Soil samples (3.00 g) were extracted with
30 mL 1 mol/L ammonium acetate solution at pH 7.00.
The soil solution slurry was shaken for 2 h, and the
solution was separated from the solid by centrifuga­
tion. The addition of excess NH 4+ to the soil displaces

the rapid exchangeable potassium from the exchange
sites of the soil particles. The concentrations of K were
subsequently analysed by the ICP-OES.



Boiling HNO 3 extraction (Helmke and Sparks 2000)
was following: 2.5 g of finely ground soil sample was
heated with 25 mL of 1 mol/L HNO 3 in an Erlenmeyer
flask on a hot plate for 10 min after boiling started.
After cooling for 5 min, the sample was filtrated and
the extract was diluted to 100 mL with 0.1 mol/L

HNO . The K concentration of the extract solution
3
was determined by the ICP-OES.

**Statistical analysis** . The results were assessed us­
ing the ANOVA statistical analysis. To evaluate the
obtained results, the Statistica programme (StatSoft
Inc. 2015, Tulsa, USA) was used.

by yields and K content in plants. At the Hněvčeves
site, higher yields of cereals were recorded (grain:
wheat – 7.07 t dry matter/ha; barley – 4.54 t dry
matter/ha) compared to the Humpolec site (grain:
wheat – 6.29 t dry matter/ha, barley – 3.83 t dry
matter/ha). Higher yields of potatoes were recorded
at the Humpolec site (7.82 t dry matter/ha) than at
the Hněvčeves site (7.40 t dry matter/ha). The con­
tents of potassium in wheat grain (0.46–0.48% K)
and barley (0.37–0.38% K) were identical at both sites.
Significantly greater differences were obtained in
the K content in straw: (Hněvčeves: wheat 0.88% K,
barley 0.98% K; Humpolec: wheat 1.03% K, barley
1.18% K); and differences were recorded for K content
in potato tubers (Hněvčeves: 1.84% K, Humpolec:
2.15% K). Even though the contents of bioavailable
potassium in soil at the Humpolec site were lower,
reported K uptake by plants was higher – by 348 kg
K/ha on average for all variants and the period of
21 years. This difference was probably caused by
higher potato yield and also by higher precipitation



and its regular distribution throughout the vegeta­
tion period, which might have a positive influence
on the K uptake. Table 3 shows the positive balance
(inputs minus outputs) only at the variant fertilized
with manure. The highest negative balance (–2376 kg
K/ha) was obtained at fertilization with mineral ni­
trogen at the Humpolec site. Negative balance was
calculated also for the NPK fertilization, with average
application dose of 90 kg K/ha/year. Neither regular
straw incorporation influenced the K balance. The
utilization of K from manure at the Hněvčeves site

was 26%, at the Humpolec site it was 24%. In case
of the NPK fertilization it was 52% (Hněvčeves) and
27% (Humpolec). There is a clear tendency to higher
K utilization at soils with higher sorption capac­
ity, which complies with the results of Blake et al.
(1999). Higher K utilization at mineral fertilization
may be caused by lower dose of K applied compared
to manure treatments. At lower application doses,
their utilisation is generally better. Blake et al. (1999)
did not determine significant differences in K bal­

ance between the manure-supplied K and mineral
fertilization. These authors explain this as a result
of K not strongly sorbed in manure.

**Content of bioavailable K** . Results obtained using
the Mehlich 3 extraction agent are given in Figure 1.
At both sites, statistically significant differences were
recorded among individual variants, in compliance
with the K fertilization intensity. At the Hněvčeves
site, the average value of all treatments reached 200 mg
K/kg, i.e. by 31% more compared to the Humpolec
site – 157 mg K/kg. As to the official assessment
of K pool in the plough layer in the CR for loamy
soils, it is ranked in the category ‘satisfactory pool’
or ‘good pool’ – based on the variant (Smatanová
and Sušil 2018). It may be presumed that even in
the control variant the yields were not influenced
by the lack of N.

As shown in Figure 2, manure application resulted
in a significant increase of the exchangeable K con­
tent. Liu et al. (2010) reported similar results in the
long-term experiments. Significantly lowest contents



were obtained at variants without K fertilization.

Comparison of both sites shows significantly higher
content (by 34.6%) at the Hněvčeves site (with average
values of 206 mg K/kg) than in Humpolec (153 mg
K/kg). If the values are recalculated to the level of satu­
ration of the sorption complex with potassium, this
parameter almost does not differ for the two sites –
it is 4.56% in Hněvčeves and 4.37% in Humpolec
(Table 4); it is given by the differences between the
total values of the cation exchangeable capacity
(Hněvčeves: 116 mmol + /kg, Humpolec: 90 mmol + /kg).
The content > 3.50% cation exchange capacity (CEC) is
considered as satisfactory for these soils. Comparison
of the K values at both extraction agents (Mehlich 3/
NH 4 OAc) shows certain similarity. For the Hněvčeves
location, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient be­

tween the K contents determined with Mehlich 3 and

NH 4 OAc was 0.989 at the significance level _P_ < 0.001;
for the Humpolec location it was 0.958. The relation­
ship between K in ammonium acetate and Mehlich
3 is: _y_ = 0.974 _x_ + 7.6145, _R_ [2] = 0.9772 (Hněvčeves),
_y_ = 0.9505 _x_ + 5.6757, _R_ [2] = 0.9815 (Humpolec). It is
thus probable that mainly exchangeable potassium
is released at the Mehlich 3 extraction. High agree­
ment of these methods is, to a certain extent, given
by the fact that the study evaluates corresponding
long-term field trials. At ordinary agricultural soils,
the agreement would probably be lower.

CAT extraction revealed significantly lower K con­
tent compared to other extraction methods (Figure 3).
The average content for all variants was 110 mg K/kg
at the Hněvčeves site and 120 mg K/kg at the
Humpolec site. It is interesting that the ratio of the
values (Hněvčeves/Humpolec) is opposite compared
to the Mehlich 3 and NH 4 OAc methods, which is
probably caused by different character of clay parti­

cles at the two sites. Binner et al. (2017) stated that

this method was sensitive at variants with added

clay sorbents of the smectite type.

**Content of non-exchangeable K** . Contents of
non-exchangeable potassium are shown in Figure 4.
Both sites significantly differ; contents were in the
range of 816 to 927 mg K/kg at the Hněvčeves site
in contrast to the interval 2908–3068 mg K/kg at the
Humpolec site. There is a significant influence of the
soil-forming materials. Parent material of Cambisol
(Humpolec) is paragneiss; in the process of material
changes (weathering) potassium is released in signifi­
cant amounts. On the contrary, Luvisol (Hněvčeves)
on loess has markedly lower potential to release
K. Blake et al. (1999) observed the changes in the
content of non-exchangeable K at long-term field
trials sites. The highest contents were reported for
Bad Lauchstadt: 1810–2196 mg K/ha, whereas lower
contents were reported for Rothamsted: 650–1442 mg
K/ha. This corresponds with the range recorded at the
Hněvčeves site. High contents approaching 3000 mg
K/kg were published by Øgaard and Krogstad (2005)
for selected soils in Norway. Figure 4 shows that
completely different fertilization for the period of
21 years did not have a significant impact on the
changes of non-exchangeable K at the Humpolec site,
not even at variants unfertilized with K in the long
term. At comparison of K amount obtained at harvest
(1663–2376 kg K/ha) and the content of non-ex­
changeable K in the plough layer (ca 12 500–12 800 kg
K/ha) it is clear that the effect of fertilization on the
changes in the non-exchangeable K may not have
been manifested.


At the Hněvčeves site, a significant tendency to
decrease the non-exchangeable K content was ob­


**230**



served at the variants without K fertilization. The

content of non-exchangeable K in the plough layer was
ca 3600–3800 kg/ha, which is comparable with the
K values at harvest (1124–2111 kg K/ha). Moreover,
non-exchangeable K was also important for replen­
ishing plant-available K in soil at this site. A decrease
of the non-exchangeable K in the long-term trials
at the unfertilized variants compared to the manure
application was reported also by Blake et al. (1999)
and Srinivvasarao et al. (2014). Furthermore, it must
be stressed that not all of the non-exchangeable K
may be used by plants, as it is released continuously
during many years, as was reported by Moritsuka et
al. (2002). Non-exchangeable K release depends on
many factors, such as K concentration in soil solu­
tion, concentration of other cations and pH value
(Wang et al. 2011).

Table 5 summarizes the results of individual tested

methods related to the boiling HNO 3 extraction. At
the Hněvčeves site, the average content of 1069 mg
K/ha was obtained, whereas at the Humpolec site it
was 3167 mg K/kg. The ratio of non-exchangeable
K at Luvisol (Hněvčeves) was 80.9%, as compared to

Cambisol (Humpolec) with 95.2%. The comparison
of the Mehlich 3 and NH OAc methods shows that

their extraction strength is similar. The values ob­
tained using the CAT extraction were only 60–65%
compared to the previous methods.

**Changes in K in 1996/2017** . The archive samples
from 1996 were analysed (for each parcel individu­
ally) and the results were compared with the 2017
analysis. The differences in the potassium content in
the plough layer (kg K/ha) are reported in Table 6.
K amount in the plough layer decreased in all the un­
fertilized variants. The highest decrease is recorded at
variant with mineral N fertilization. The comparison
of negative values in the potassium balance (Table 3)
and changes in Table 6 shows that the values in Table 6
are lower compared to the balance only. It can be
explained by continuous mobilisation of potassium
from the non-exchangeable bonds and further also by
not considering the K content in the subsoil, which is
also a significant potassium source for plants.
