and from 6990 mg kg- [1] to 33330 mg kg- [1] in surface
and sub-surface soils, respectively under different
cropping systems. Available K ranged from 0.58 to
1.33% and 0.11 to 1.58%, water soluble K 0.07 to
0.18% and 0.03 to 0.18%, exchangeable K 0.44 to
1.20% and 0.14 to 1.44%, non-exchangeable K 2.33
to 5.08% and 1.15 to 6.26% and lattice K 94.00 to

97.08% and 92.16 to 98.68% in surface and sub-sur
face soils of total potassium, respectively under
different cropping systems. All the forms of K were
correlated with each other revealing the existence of
dynamic equilibrium among them.

**INTRODUCTION**


Soil fertility is declining mostly as a result of excessive nutrient loss and insufficient nutrient addition via
fertilizers and manures. This circumstance puts Indian
agriculture under pressure to produce more food on
dwindling arable land. Thus, intensive cropping is
necessary and future food production will grow increasingly reliant on mineral fertilizers, which have
become indispensable for assuring adequate food
production and reversing soil productivity reduction
due to nutrient depletion.


Potassium is third most important plant nutrient
which is absorbed by plant is in larger amount than


426


any other mineral element except nitrogen and it is
one of the three main pillars of balanced fertilizer use,
along with nitrogen and phosphorus. The potassium is
mobile in plant, unlike other major nutrients, it’s not
the integral part of the plant component but, it plays
a vital role in enzyme activity, acts as a catalyst for
carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, translocation of assimilates, synthesis of proteins, as well as
formation, break down and translocation of starch,
maintains water balance, agronomic productivity and
sustainability (Mangel 1985).


The results of long term fertilizer experiments in
India revealed that by growing crops without K for
longer periods lead the mining of soil native K and
there by declining available K. The availability of
K in soil is governed by both organic and inorganic
forms and prevailing soil chemical environment.
Availability of native K to plants is largely regulated
by the dynamic equilibrium existing between different
forms of K viz., water soluble-K, which is taken up
by the plants and microbes directly (Sparks 2000);
exchangeable-K, held by negative charges on clay
particles, humic substances and it is exchangeable
with cations and readily available to plants, non-exchangeable or fixed-K, which is trapped between
the layers of dioctahedral and trioctahedral micas,
vermiculites and it is sparingly available to plants
(Sparks and Huang 1985) and while lattice –K or
mineral or structural K, an integral part of primary
K bearing minerals which compraises 98% of total
K. Knowledge on these different potassium fractions
in soils is essential for potassium management to
determine long term sustainability of cropping systems. To formulate sound fertilizer recommendation,
potassium supplying capacity of soil is essential.
This will depend not only on the available K content
of soil, but also knowledge on different forms of K
and their relationship among themselves is required.
Keeping this in view, the present study was under
taken to assess dynamics of soil potassium under
different cropping systems in Y.S.R Kadapa district
of Andhra Pradesh.


**MATERIALS AND METHODS**


The present study was carried out in Y.S.R Kadapa



district of Andhra Pradesh. The district is situated at

Geographical Co-ordination of 13° 43’ to 15° 14’ of
Northern latitude and 77° 55’ to 79° 29’ of the Eastern

longitude. This district lies in river basin of Pennar.
The district is classified as drought Prone area due to
scanty and uneven distribution of rain fall. The annual
rainfall of the district is 700 mm. Five soil samples
from each cropping system at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm
depths were collected from the Y.S.R. district viz.,
fallow – bengalgram, sunflower – sesame, paddy
– paddy, groundnut mono cropping and groundnut –
groundnut cropping sequences during 2018-19. Soil
sample were air-dried, ground in a wooden pestle with
mortar and passed through a 2mm stainless steel sieve
and used for determining various soil properties by
following standard procedures.


Water soluble K was extracted by shaking the
soil water suspension in the ratio of 1:5 for 5 min
then filtered and K was determined (Jackson 1973)
and available K was extracted with neutral normal

ammonium acetate with 1:5 soil solution ratio and
shaking for five minutes (Hanway and Heidel 1952).
The exchangeable K was obtained by subtracting
water-soluble K from available K. The non-exchangeable K was estimated by following the method as
described by Wood and De Turk (1941). Lattice-K
was calculated from the difference between total K
and the sum of NH 4 OAc-K and nonexchangeable K
(Wiklander 1954). Total K in soil was estimated by
HF-HClO 4 digestion method using platinum crucibles as outlined by Pratt (1965). Potassium in all the
extracts was estimated flame photometrically. The
statistical analysis was done to understand correlation
among different forms of potassium and with soil
properties


**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**


Distribution of different forms of potassium under
different cropping systems tabulated in Table 1.


**Available K**


The available K content of surface soils varied from
73.65 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system
to 282.80 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence
with mean values of 84.55 and 262.80 mg kg- [1] and

their per cent contribution to total K 0.58 and 1.33,
respectively. In sub-surface soils available K content
varied from 51.30 mg kg- [1] in groundnut monocropping system to 160.90 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence with mean values of 55.08 and 151.73
mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K 0.17
and 1.58, respectively.


The highest available potassium was observed in
soils of paddy-paddy cropping system in both surface
and sub-surface soils, which might be due to contin


uous application of potassic fertilizers to both the
crops and lowest available potassium was recorded
in sunflower-sesame cropping system and groundnut
monocropping system in surface and sub-surface
soils, respectively which might be due to continuous
less application of potassic fertilizers application
than crop needed or imbalanced fertilization in crop
nutrition caused mining of its native pools. Similar
results reported by Katkar _et al_ . (2011). The data
further revealed that highest available potassium was
observed in surface soils than in sub-surface soils in


428


all cropping systems, which might be attributed to
presence of vegetation or upward translocation of K
from lower layers through capillary rise or ground
water as reported by Lungmuana _et al_ . (2014).


**Water soluble K**


The water soluble K content of surface soils varied
from 5.5 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping
system to 43.30 mg kg- [1] in groundnut -groundnut
cropping sequence with mean values of 9.52 and
37.24 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K
0.07 and 0.18, respectively. In sub-surface soils water
soluble K content varied from 5.05 mg kg- [1] in sunin
flower-sesame cropping system to 17.25 mg kg- [1]
groundnut -groundnut cropping sequence with mean
values of 6.63 and 14.35 mg kg- [1] and their per cent
contribution to total K 0.03 and 0.18, respectively.


The highest water soluble K was observed in
soils of groundnut-groundnut cropping system in
surface and sub-surface soils, which might be due to
addition of fertilizers, presence of potassium bearing
minerals while lowest water soluble K was observed
in sunflower-sesame cropping system at both depths,
which might be due to exhaustive nature of crops.
The data further revealed that highest water soluble
K was observed in surface soils than in sub-surface

soils in all cropping systems, which might be due to
capillary movement of potassium from lower depth
to upper portion reported by Hebsur and Gali (2011).


**Exchangeable K**


The exchangeable K content of surface soils varied
from 68.10 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping
system to 254.10 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping
sequence with mean values of 75.03 and 236.77
mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K
0.52 and 1.20, respectively. In sub-surface soils
exchangeable K content varied from 43.70 mg kg- [1]
in groundnut monocropping system to 144.05 mg
kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence with mean
values of 46.07 and 138.84 mg kg- [1] and their per cent
contribution to total K 0.14 and 1.44, respectively.


The highest exchangeable K was observed in
soils of paddy-paddy cropping system in both surface



and sub-surface soils, which might be due to high
dose of K fertilizers were applied to paddy in both
seasons or due to the fact that soils contain relatively
higher clay per cent which offered more exchangeable sites for K. these results were in agreement with
(Hebsur and Gali 2011) and lowest exchangeable K
was observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system
and groundnut monocropping system in surface and
sub-surface soils respectively might be due to exhaustive nature of sunflower and sesame crops and low
utilization under groundnut monocropping system or
due to non replenishment of K from the other (Rao
_et al_ . 2013). The results further revealed that highest
exchangeable K was observed in surface soils than in
sub-surface soils in all cropping systems.


**Non-exchangeable K**


The non-exchangeable K content of surface soils
varied from 309.95 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame
cropping system to 970.35 mg kg- [1] in fallow-bengalgram cropping sequence with mean values of 337.35
and 896.49 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution
to total K 2.33 and 5.08, respectively. In sub-surface
soils non-exchangeable K content varied from 238.80
mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system to
623.00 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence
with mean values of 275.13 and 602.53 mg kg- [1] and
their per cent contribution to total K 1.15 and 6.26,
respectively.


The highest non-exchangeable K was observed
in soils of fallow-bengalgram cropping system and
paddy-paddy in surface and sub-surface soils, respectively which might be due to higher percentage
of clay in these soils and lowest non-exchangeable K
was observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system
at both depths, which might be due to continuous
cropping with less application of K fertilizers may
decreased K content in these cropping systems. The
data further revealed that highest non-exchangeable
K was observed in surface soils than in sub-surface
soils in all cropping systems. These findings were in
agreement with Mazumdar _et al._ 2014.


**Lattice K**


The lattice K content of surface soils varied from


11498.10 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping
system to 23326.60 mg kg- [1] in groundnut-groundnut
cropping sequence with mean values of 14038.10 and
20116.32 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to
total K 94.00 and 97.08, respectively. In sub-surface
soils lattice K content varied from 6460.20 mg kg- [1]
in groundnut-groundnut cropping system to 35828.20
mg kg- [1] in groundnut monocropping sequence with
mean values of 7219.58 and 31708.88 mg kg- [1] and
their per cent contribution to total K 92.18 and 98.68,
respectively.


The highest lattice K was observed in soils of
groundnut-groundnut cropping system and groundnut
monocropping system in surface and sub-surface
soils, respectively. These findings were in accordance
with Sawarkar _et al_ . 2013 which might be due to these
soils were derived from potassic bearing minerals
however, lowest lattice K was observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system and groundnut-groundnut
cropping system in surface and sub-surface soils,
respectively. The data further revealed that highest lattice K was observed in surface soils than in

sub-surface soils in all cropping systems, except in
fallow-bengalgram cropping system and groundnut
monocropping system which might be attributed to
increase in finer fractions of soil particles at lower
depth.


**Total K**


The total K content of surface soils varied from
11920 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system
to 24190 mg kg- [1] in groundnut-groundnut cropping
sequence with mean values of 14460 and 20952 mg
kg- [1], respectively. In sub-surface soils total K content
varied from 6990 mg kg- [1 ] in groundnut-groundnut



429


cropping system to 33330 mg kg- [1] in groundnut
monocropping sequence with mean values of 7834
and 32134 mg kg- [1], respectively.


The highest total K was observed in soils of
groundnut-groundnut cropping system and groundnut
monocropping system in surface and sub-surface
soils, respectively which might be due to predominance of potassium bearing primary minerals and
lowest total K was observed in sunflower-sesame
cropping system and groundnut-groundnut cropping
system in surface and sub-surface soils, respectively.
The data further revealed that highest total K was
observed in surface soils than in sub-surface soils in

all cropping systems, except in fallow-bengalgram
cropping system and groundnut monocropping system. Similar results were reported by Mazumdar _et_
_al._ (2014).


**Correlation among forms of potassium**


Correlation between forms of potassium with soil
properties in surface and sub-surface soils, tabulated
in Tables 2-3, respectively.


In surface soils available K was positively
and significantly correlated with water soluble K
(r = 0.416*), exchangeable K (r = 0.987**) and
non-exchangeable K (r = 0.791**). Similar results
were obtained by Swamanna _et al._ (2015) under rice
growing soils of Kurnool district of A.P. Available
K also showed positive and significant correlation
with total K (r = 0.421*). Water soluble K was
highly and significantly correlated with available K
(r = 0.416*) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.744**).
Similar results were reported by Kundu _et al_ . (2014)
under inceptisols of Janjgir district of Chhattisgarh.

Water soluble K also showed positive and significant
correlation with lattice K (r = 0.665**) and total K (r
= 0.682**). These observations were in accordance
to the results reported by Dhakad _et al_ . (2017), Saini
and Grewal (2014). Exchangeable K was highly and
significantly correlated with available K (r = 0.987**)
and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.708**) indicating that
decline in the level of exchangeable K is replenished
by the release of non-exchangeable K. Similar results
reported by Elbaalawy _et al._ (2016). Swamanna _et_
_al. (_ 2015). Non-exchangeable K was highly and significantly correlated with available K (r = 0.791**),
water soluble K (r = 744**) and exchangeable K (r =
0.708**). Similar observations were made by Dhakad
_et al_ . (2017), Lakaria _et al_ . (2012), Prasad _et al._
_(_ 2010), Swamanna _et al._ (2015). Non-exchangeable
K positively and significantly correlated with lattice K
(r = 705**) and total K (r = 0.741**). Lattice K was
highly and significantly correlated with water soluble
K (r = 0.665**) non-exchangeable K (r = 0.705**)
and total K (r = 0.999**). Total K was highly and
significantly correlated with available K (r = 0.421*),
water soluble K (r = 0.682**), non-exchangeable K (r
= 0.741**) and lattice K (r = 0.999**). Similar results
were obtained by Dhakad _et al_ . (2017) indicating
that these relationships confirmed that availability of
exchangeable, nonexchangeable and total potassium
could significantly determine potentially available
potassium in these soils.


All the forms of K showed a positive trend of
correlation among themselves largely corroborating
the well-known concept of existence of a dynamic
equilibrium among different forms of K present in
soil through which K supply to the roots of crop
plants are directly or indirectly ensured as reported



Lungmuana _et al._ 2014.


In sub-surface soils available K was highly and
significantly correlated with exchangeable K (r =
0.766**) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.943**).
Similar observations were made by Jatav and Dewangan (2012). Whereas available K also showed
negative and significant correlation with lattice K (r
= -0.482*) and total K (r = -0.472*). Water soluble
K was positively and significantly correlated with
non-exchangeable K (r = 0.486*). Exchangeable K
was highly and significantly correlated with available
K (r = 0.766**) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.701*).
Similar results reported by Jatav and Dewangan
(2012) Rajeevana and Kavitha (2017). Non-exchangeable K was highly and significantly correlated
with available K (r = 0.943**), water soluble K (r =
0.486*) and exchangeable K (r = 0.701**). Similar
observations were made by Rajeevana and Dewangan
(2017). Non-exchangeable K was negatively and
significantly correlated with lattice K (r = -0.472*)
and total K (r = -0.462*). Lattice K was highly and
significantly correlated with total K (r = 0.999**)
while it was negatively and significantly correlated
with available K  (r = -0.482*) and non-exchangeable
K (r = -0.472*). Total K was highly and significantly
correlated with lattice K (r = 0.999**) but it was negatively and significantly correlated with available K
(r = -0.472*) and non-exchangeable K (r = -0.462*).


**CONCLUSION**


Based on these results, it is therefore suggested that
K removal by the crop must be supplemented to
sustain the soil fertility either by K application or by


crop straw incorporation to the soil. Soil K fractions
varied with depth and cropping sequences. Soil K
fractions were found in the order lattice K > non-ex
changeable K > available K > exchangeable K > water
soluble K. Under irrigated conditions all the forms
of potassium were highest in paddy-paddy cropping
system followed by groundnut-groundnut cropping
system and sunflower-sesame cropping system while
under rainfed conditions all the forms of potassium
were highest in fallow-bengalgram cropping system
followed by groundnut monocropping system. The
results and the methodology adopted in the present
study will be useful in assessing forms of K under
different cropping systems. These results would not
only useful for the study area, but also in other cropping systems across the globe.
