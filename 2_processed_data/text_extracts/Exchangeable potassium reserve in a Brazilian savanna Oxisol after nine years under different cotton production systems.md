**Introduction**


**​**



**ABSTRACT** : Adequate potassium (K) fertilization is essential for agricultural production in


soils of the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado biome) due to the high demand by crops (especially


cotton), likelihood of leaching losses, and the dependence on fertilizer importations. Therefore,


sustainability requires improvements in the soil efficiency management. This study evaluated


the influence of soil management and crop succession or rotation combinations with cotton


on K dynamics and exchangeable reserves in the soil profile, and the partial balance of K after


nine years of cultivation in a clayey Oxisol in the Cerrado. The soil was sampled in layers up


to 100 cm depth in four cotton production systems treatments: 1) conventional soil tillage


(CST) with cotton monoculture; 2) CST with annual cotton-soybean-cotton succession; 3) CST


with cotton/soybean/maize rotation; and 4) no-tillage system (NTS) with cotton/soybean/


maize rotation and _Urochloa ruziziensis_ (ruzigrass) as a cover crop in the off-season after grain


crops. The experiment was conducted using a randomized block design with four replications.


CST with cotton monoculture favored the leaching of K surplus from fertilization. Crop rotation


including ruzigrass in the NTS allowed better control of K dynamics, ensuring its circulation in


the soil-plant compartments and reducing leaching. The increased organic matter (OM) in this


system enlarges the storage capacity of K in the topsoil. The adoption of no-tillage crop systems


integrating ruzigrass is viable to improve the efficiency of K fertilizers in cotton cultivation in


highly weathered tropical soils.

Brazil is one of the world’s major cotton producers with
a cultivated area of 1.66 million ha in the 2019-2020 **​**

season and 98 % of the production from the Cerrado
biome (CONAB, 2020), a Brazilian tropical savanna
that encompasses around 205 million ha. Oxisols (Soil
Survey Staff, 2014), predominant soil group in the
Cerrado, have good drainage, but are naturally acidic,
presenting high Al saturation and poor natural fertility
with low OM content and CEC. The use of liming
and fertilizer amendments in the last decades led

soils to become one of the most relevant agricultural
environments for food production worldwide (Lopes
and Guilherme, 2016).
To achieve high yield and fiber quality, cotton
cropping in Cerrado uses large amounts of fertilizers,
which increase the production cost. Cotton demands
high amounts of K, since it is vital for fiber formation
and quality (Yang et al., 2016). The production of 1 ton
of seed cotton requires an extraction equivalent to 58
kg ha [–1] of K 2 O from the soil, but only 30 % of that is
exported by the harvested cottonseeds and fibers (Borin
et al., 2019).
In tropical soils, K supply to plants occurs
mainly by the exchangeable form, but also by the
non-exchangeable form and K is also released by crop
residues (Rosolem et al., 2019). Depending on fertilizer



management, crop combination, and soil characteristics,
K surplus from fertilization remain more susceptible to
runoff or leaching losses. Since these soils have a limited

**​** K adsorption capacity, no-tillage system (NTS) and the

insertion of forage grasses into crop rotation can be a
strategy to conserve soil K fertility, because Poaceae
plants are very efficient in cycling K (Garcia et al., 2008;
Resende et al., 2019; Rosolem et al., 2019).
Consumption of K fertilizers in Brazil reached
6.77 million tons of K 2 O in 2018, while worldwide use
corresponded to 38.85 million tons of K 2 O (FAO, 2020).
National mineral reserves are limited and currently
about 95 % of the K fertilizer is imported (Boldrin et
al., 2019), which justifies efforts in developing technical
approaches to increase the K use efficiency in the
Brazilian agriculture.
This study evaluated the influence of soil
management and crop combinations with cotton on
K dynamics, exchangeable reserves in the soil and
partial balance after nine years in a clayey Oxisol in the
Brazilian Cerrado.

municipality of Santa Helena de Goiás, Goiás, Brazil
(17°50’37” S, 50°35’52” W, and altitude 557 m). The soil
is classified as clayey dystrophic Red Latosol (Santos et
al., 2013), Typic Haplorthox (Oxisol) (Soil Survey Staff,
2014). The climate is Aw, according to the Köppen-Geiger
climate classification system (Alvares et al., 2013), with
an average rainfall of 1,800 mm, concentrated from Oct
to Mar.

In the three years prior to the experiment, the area
was cultivated with cotton, and before that, soybean
monoculture, with the soil prepared annually by plowing
and harrowing. In Aug 2005, the soil was sampled at
0-20 cm depth and underwent the chemical and particle
size analyses (Table 1). In early Sept 2005, the entire
experimental area received 2,200 kg ha [–1] of calcitic
limestone with 90 % calcium carbonate equivalent and
was subsoiled at 35 cm depth, subsequently plowed and
harrowed.


**Experimental design and treatments**


The experiment was conducted for nine years and
consisted of four production systems involving cotton
cultivation: 1) conventional soil tillage (CST) with
cotton monoculture CSTCM; 2) CST with annual cottonsoybean-cotton succession (CSTCSC); 3) CST with cotton/
soybean/maize rotation (CSTCSM); and 4) cotton under
a no-tillage system - NTS [soybean (spring-summer)
+ _Urochloa ruziziensis_ (ruzigrass) (autumn-winter)/
maize intercropped with ruzigrass (spring-summer)/
cotton (spring-summer-autumn)]. CST treatments were
fallow in autumn-winter (Table 2). The experiment was
conducted using a randomized block design with four



replications. The experimental plot for each cropping
system covered an area of 576 m [2] (14.4 × 40 m). Native
vegetation (native Cerrado) without management
interventions in a site adjacent to the experiment was
used as a reference for exchangeable K and OM content
in the soil profile.


**Tillage systems, crop management, and harvest**


Treatments with CST were prepared annually between
late Sept and early Oct, after the beginning of the rainy
season. The preparation consisted of a disc harrowing
to turn the soil over up to 20 cm deep, followed by a
leveling disc harrowing. Another leveling disc harrowing
operation was performed two days before soybean,
maize, or cotton sowing.
In Aug 2009, 2,000 kg ha [—1] of dolomitic limestone
with 85 % calcium carbonate equivalent was applied.
In Oct 2009, before sowing the crops, 1,000 kg ha [–1] of
phosphogypsum (PG) was added. In CST treatments,
these additives were incorporated up to 20 cm with
plowing and harrowing and were broadcasted on the
soil surface without incorporation in the NTS treatment.
During the nine years of the experiment, soybean
was sown in the spring, in the second half of Oct,
after the beginning of the rainy season. Soybean row
spacing was 45 cm. Maize was sown between late
Oct and early Nov also at 45-cm row spacing. Cotton
was sown from late Nov to mid-Dec, with 80 cm row
spacing. Plant populations per ha ranged from 350,000
to 400,000, 55,000 to 65,000, and 80,000 to 100,000, for
soybean, maize, and cotton, respectively, depending on
the cultivar used each year. Cultivar, plant population,

fertilization, and chemical control of pests, diseases, and
weeds were standardized for each crop and within each
agricultural year.
The mean annual fertilizations, in kg ha [–1] of N,
P 2 O 5, and K 2 O, were 111, 126, and 130 for cotton; 6,
54, and 46 for soybean; and 97, 119, and 137 for maize,
respectively, adjusted based on the recommendations
for these crops (Sousa and Lobato, 2004). All soybean
fertilization was applied in the sowing furrow. Maize
and cotton received all phosphate fertilizer and
approximately 20 % of N and 50 % of K 2 O in the sowing
furrow. The remaining N and K 2 O amounts were divided
into two topdressing applications. The total amounts
of fertilizers, in kg ha [–1] of N, P 2 O 5, and K 2 O, were 999,
1,134, and 1,170 in CSTCM treatment; 579, 846 and 834
in CSTCSC and 642, 897 and 939 in CSTCSM and NTS.
In the NTS treatment, after soybean harvest,
ruzigrass was mechanically sown using 6 kg ha [–1] of
seeds with 100 % culture value. This operation occurred
two days after desiccation of volunteer soybean plants
and weeds in the plots using the paraquat herbicide
(400 g ha [–1] of active ingredient). Maize in the NTS was
intercropped with ruzigrass using 7 kg ha [–1] of seeds
with 85 % culture value mixed with the starter fertilizer

distributed in the sowing furrows. Ruzigrass remained in
the plots as a cover plant throughout the off-season after
soybean or maize and was desiccated with glyphosate
(1,400 g ha [–1 ] of active ingredient) 30 days before sowing
the next maize or cotton crop.
Cotton, maize, and soybean crops were manually
harvested in each experimental plot, at three random
points, each including four rows 5-m long. Yield was
obtained by adding the data collected at the three points
and the results were converted into kg ha [–1 ] and grain
moisture corrected to 13 %.

The accumulated export of K in each production
system was determined by multiplying crop yields by
the mean removal rates, equivalent to 17, 20, and 3.7
kg of K 2 O per ton of seed cotton, soybean, and maize
grains, respectively (Borin et al., 2019; Duarte et al.,
2019; Embrapa, 2013). From exported quantities, partial
balances of K (Resende et al., 2019) were estimated, as
well as the exported/applied ratios of the K fertilizer
used in the period.


**Soil sampling and analysis**


In Oct 2014, soil samples were collected from the
experimental plots and in the native Cerrado of an
adjacent area, at the 0-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-60, and 61100 cm layers of the profile, to analyze the exchangeable
K and soil organic matter (SOM) contents. At each depth,
10 soil samples were collected and homogenized to form
a composite sample for the laboratory analysis. The
exchangeable K was extracted with Mehlich-1 solution
and quantified in a flame photometer, while SOM was
determined by the Walkley-Black method (Teixeira et
al., 2017).


**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**



**Statistical analysis**


The data at each sampling layer were submitted to the
analysis of variance using SISVAR software (Statistical
Analysis System, version 5.6) with means compared by
the Tukey test. A _p_ ≤ 0.05 was used to indicate statistical
significance.


**Results and Discussion**


**Exchangeable potassium and organic matter**
**contents in the soil**


Although the exchangeable K contents were not
statistically compared between the sampling depths,
the highest absolute values were detected in the upper
layers of the soil profile, mainly at 0-5 cm, decreasing
progressively with depth, irrespective of the treatment
(Figure 1). Ferreira et al. (2009) also observed this
tendency in a Rhodic Hapludox (Oxisol). The authors
stated that reducing K levels in the profile are associated
with a gradual lowering in organic carbon (OC) contents
and soil organic matter (SOM) to retain cations in deeper
layers.
The SOM levels determined in the samples up
to 100 cm in the profile (Figure 2) follow the same
tendency as exchangeable K (Figure 1), indicating a
strong relationship between these two variables. This
behavior is expected for highly weathered soils, with
low-activity clays, like the studied Oxisol, in which SOM
accounts for most CEC (Lopes and Guilherme, 2016)
and, therefore, for the retention of K in the soil profile.
The highest K content (1.18 cmol c dm [–3] ) in NTS
was found in the 0-5 cm layer (Figure 1) and was 79 %
higher than the mean value of the three CST treatments,
consistent with the higher SOM content in this layer
for NTS (Figure 2). Considering that the SOM and CEC
are positively correlated in the Cerrado Oxisols (Lopes
and Guilherme, 2016; Ramos et al., 2018), it seems
that the increased CEC enhances the K retention and

accumulation. The absence of soil tillage for nine years,
straw production and abundant root development of _U._
_ruziziensis_ (ruzigrass) used as a cover plant (Sanches et
al., 2020), along with cotton, maize, and soybean crop
residues in the NTS treatment, certainly had a positive
influence on SOM accumulation and, consequently,
on K levels in the 0-5 cm layer. The average annual of
straw available in NTS for soybean sowing was 3,945
kg ha [–1], from cotton crop residues; for corn sowing,
9,137 kg ha [–1] of the ruzigrass straw; and for cotton
sowing, 11,388 kg ha [–1] of the maize crop residues and
ruzigrass straw.
The production system and history of K
fertilization influenced the K dynamics in soil profile.
In the upmost surface layer, the exchangeable K content
was 66 % higher in NTS compared to CSTCM. However,
in the deeper sampling layer, the situation was reversed
with CSTCM presenting more than twice the K content

(Figure 1). The comparison between the CSTCSM and
NTS treatments, which received the same commercial
crops and fertilizer amounts, shows that in the latter,
the K content in the 0-5, 6-10, and 11-20 cm layers,
was 93 %, 115 %, and 117 % higher, respectively. At
depths 21-30, 31-60, and 61-100, the K levels were
statistically similar between the CSTCSC, CSTCSM, and
NTS treatments. These results reflect the role of SOM

in increasing the net negative charge of the soil that can
retain more cations in the top layers of the NTS (Ramos
et al., 2018), as well as the active recovery of K by the
ruzigrass root system from the deep layers to topsoil
(Tanaka et al., 2019).
The weighted average of the sample layers up to
20 cm shows that the exchangeable K corresponded to
0.53 cmol c dm [–3] in the NTS, equivalent to 829 kg ha [–1]
of potassium chloride fertilizer (KCl), and to 0.26 cmol c
dm [–3] in CSTCSM (407 kg ha [–1] of KCl). The conservationist
management system with crop rotation under no-tillage
and the inclusion of ruzigrass as a cover plant in the
off-season retained more than twice the K available for


**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**



absorption in the soil layer with greater root activity of
the commercial crops, equivalent to about 422 kg ha [–1]
of additional KCl. This contrasting dynamics reinforces
the importance of the no-till farming to prevent nutrient
losses to runoff (Almeida et al., 2021), besides the strong
influence of covering the soil by living plants as much
as possible throughout the year to keep K recycling and
its accessibility to plants in the crop system (Resende et
al., 2019). The joint effect of no-till and ruzigrass activity
composes an effective way to improve the use efficiency
of K fertilizer in tropical soils.
Although not statistically compared, the reference
soil from the native Cerrado area that had never been

fertilized presented exchangeable K levels similar to
those found in some production systems with annual
crops at different depths (Figure 1). This shows that
the clayey soil with a relatively high SOM content
in that area (Figure 2) has a natural K reserve that is
possibly kept due to the action of native vegetation roots
distributed at great depths, promoting efficient recycling
over time.

**Partial potassium balance and exchangeable**
**potassium pool in the soil profile**


The highest exchangeable K levels in the deeper sampling
layer were observed in the CSTCM treatment (Figure 1).
This treatment received the greatest cumulative dose of
the nutrient over the nine years of the experiment (Figure
3A), which, associated with recurrent monocrop, plowing
and harrowing, must have led to K mobilization to the
deeper layers of the soil profile. Below 60 cm, the volume
and specific surface area of cotton roots are much smaller
(Carmi et al., 1993), restricting their capacity to absorb
nutrients. This low absorption possibly increases K loss
from the system due to leaching out of the root exploration

zone.
The equivalent amounts of K 2 O stored up to 100
cm deep were estimated for the treatments, assuming
a soil bulk density equal to 1.0 kg dm [–3] over the entire
sampling profile. The native Cerrado soil condition had
± 591 kg ha [–1] of K 2 O equivalent in exchangeable form,
which reflects a stabilized state mainly because of
biological recycling. Therefore, the anthropic use of soils
with cultivation for many years before the experiment


**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**



must have changed this equilibrium. Nevertheless, the
pool of exchangeable K that built up after nine years of
fertilization in different production systems (Figure 3A)
indicates that the cultivated Oxisol can retain, at least
temporarily, a higher amount of K in the profile than the
existing amount in the original environment.
Soil acidity control practices, such as liming and PG
amending, may promote an increase in CEC in soils with
predominance of variable charges, as observed by Fageria
et al. (2014), enhancing the potential for K retention
by negative colloidal charges. However, the effects of
different management systems on the dynamics and
storage of the K provided in fertilizations were evident
(Figures 3A and 3B).
The CSTCM and NTS treatments had the highest
content of exchangeable K in the soil after nine years
(Figure 3A); however, its distribution in the profile
(Figure 3B) indicates a different behavior between these
treatments. In CSTCM, almost half of the K detected was
in the layer below 30 cm depth, indicating likelihood for
leaching. In the NTS, a proportion of almost 70 % remained
in the topsoil layer (up to 30 cm), showing that this system
conditioned a more conservative environment for the K

**Ferreira et al.** **Potassium reserve in Oxisol**



supplied in fertilization. Furthermore, its retention in a
position in the profile with greater presence and activity of
commercial crops roots can improve the K use efficiency.
An important differential in the NTS was the
inclusion of ruzigrass intercropped with maize and as
subsequent crop to soybean, acting as a cover plant and
improving K cycling in the system. According to Ferreira
et al. (2018), the use of Poaceae species as cover crops
(including ruzigrass) after the soybean harvest increases
biomass production, providing soil protection and
straw for subsequent cotton cultivation under no-till in
the Cerrado region. Oliveira et al. (2019) reported that
maize intercropped with _Urochloa brizantha_ produces a
high amount of plant residues, in addition to nutrient
cycling, including K. The same authors reported that
plant biomass of _U. brizantha_ or ruzigrass accumulated K
similarly to or more than maize.
When compared to annual crops in general,
_Urochloa_ species develop a root system that penetrates
deeper into the soil, with a large volume of roots, enabling
high K absorption (Rosolem et al., 2019), including the
non-exchangeable forms (Volf et al., 2018). According to
Römheld and Kirkby (2010), K is transported mainly by
diffusion from the soil to the root surface and the presence
of hairs is crucial in absorption, as it increases the surface
area of the root cylinder and the concentration gradient
that triggers the K influx.



After successive harvests along nine cropping
seasons in different production systems, the total K
export expressed as K 2 O equivalent was estimated
at 553, 587, 454, and 487 kg ha [–1] for total adding of
1,170, 834, 939, and 939 kg ha [–1] of K 2 O via fertilization
in the treatments CSTCM, CSTCSC, CSTCSM, and
NTS, respectively. The partial balance between K
input and output in the systems indicated surpluses
and the exported/applied nutrient ratio corresponded
to relatively low offtake rates, ranging from 47 to
70 % (Table 3). Thus, K additions by fertilization
surpassed the harvest removal in all production
systems, especially CSTCM, in which the combined
effects of CST, absence of crop rotation, and higher K
fertilization resulted in proportionally greater leaching
to subsurface layers (Figures 1 and 3B), despite the fine
texture in the soil with 495 g kg [–1] of clay. The fate of the
fertilizer K can follow different paths, besides the crop
uptake, including adsorption in exchangeable positions
on colloids, conversion to non-exchangeable forms,
and losses by runoff and leaching (Rosolem et al.,
2019). As the Oxisol is typically well drained and the
experiment was installed in a field almost flat, greater
importance of leaching can be expected in the potential
K losses. According to Moterle et al. (2019), when K
fertilization generates a positive balance that exceeds
the soil buffering capacity, the presence of higher

exchangeable K levels increases leaching. Thus, once
a sufficiency level for a given soil type is established,
fertilizer recommendations closer to the crop needs
are desirable, in amounts equivalent to K export in
the harvested products, which minimizes translocation
down the profile and eventual K losses outside the root
zone (Kaminski et al., 2010).
Before the experiment beginning, the exchangeable
K content was 0.23 cmol c dm [–3] in the 0-20 cm layer,
equivalent to 216 kg ha [–1] of K 2 O when assuming a soil
bulk density of 1.0 kg dm [–3] . After nine years under
the NTS treatment, subtracting this initial reserve, the
estimated stock for the same layer corresponded to
63 % of the surplus of 452 kg ha [–1] of K 2 O calculated
in the balance (Table 3). Among the CST treatments,
calculations revealed that the maximum percentage
retained up to 20 cm was 34 % of the surplus from
fertilization. Therefore, in addition to making the soil
prone to lose K through erosive processes, the frequent
tillage limits SOM accumulation, favoring a disruption
in the K storage capacity in the topsoil. There is a weak
K retention strength in highly weathered soils, such the
Cerrado Oxisols, as result of the low frequency of 2:1
clay minerals to generate negative charges and adsorb
cations, besides the competition with Ca and Mg derived
from liming on adsorption to colloids (Moterle et al.,
2019; Rosolem et al., 2019). These conditions make the
K surplus from fertilization more susceptible to leaching.
The mean cotton yields were 3,615, 3,855, 3,285,
and 3,885 kg ha [–1] in CSTCM, CSTCSC, CSTCSM, and
NTS treatments, respectively. Therefore, the NTS
used in the present study is recommended. The NTS
sustainability is supported by more efficient retention
and storage of surplus K supplied in fertilization, keeping
it cycling and more concentrated in the profile surface
within the reach of crop roots, providing higher cotton
yield potential.
In the NTS treatment, the combination of
cotton, soybean, and maize rotation and ruzigrass as
a cover plant, each with different characteristics of
root and shoot development, productive potential,
and life cycles, provided better soil use and K uptake
from fertilization. The inclusion of ruzigrass in this
no-tillage system promoted deep K recovery in the
profile and its maintenance in circulation in the soilplant compartments, by increasing SOM (Santos et al.,
2014), with consequent improvement in soil K buffering
capacity. Thus, this grass sustained K availability in the
upper layer, where it was retained due to the CEC from
higher SOM, reducing losses by leaching.
After absorption, K is stored in the cytoplasm
and vacuole and does not integrate any structural
component of the plant cell. With the death of plant
tissue and presence of enough moisture, the K contained
in plant residues is quickly released into the soil solution
(Lupwayi et al., 2006; Rosolem et al., 2019), contributing
to nutrition of the subsequent crop. These aspects
reinforce the premise that systems with the presence


**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**



of live plants for a longer time throughout the year are
more efficient in keeping K availability and minimizing
losses.

In all production systems, K export was lower
than the amount supplied by fertilization, generating
a surplus in the nutrient balance (Table 3), which
increased soil K availability in the 0-20 cm layer to
values above the critical level of 0.13 cmol c dm [–3] (Sousa
and Lobato, 2004). In these situations, especially in
modalities similar to the NTS used in this study, there is
an opportunity to adjust fertilization in cotton cropping
systems to reduce production costs and increase the use
efficiency of K fertilizer.


**Conclusions**


Conventional tillage in clayey Oxisol with cotton
monoculture favors the leaching of K surplus from
fertilization. Conversely, no-tillage system with cotton /
soybean / maize rotation and the inclusion of ruzigrass
as a cover plant allows better control of the K dynamics,
keeping it in circulation in the root zone and reducing
losses by leaching. Increased OM in this system enlarges
the K storage capacity in the topsoil. The adoption of
no-tillage crop systems integrating grass species, such as
_Urochloa_ _ruziziensis_, is a viable way to improve the use
efficiency of K fertilizers for cotton cultivation in highly
weathered tropical soils.
