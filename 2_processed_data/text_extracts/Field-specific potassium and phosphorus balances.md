**Abstract** Fertilizer K and P requirements for rice ( _Oryza sativa_ L.) can be

determined with site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) using estimated
target yield, nutrient balances, and yield gains from added nutrient. We used the
QUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) model with
>8000 plot-level observations to estimate the relationship between grain yield
and nutrient accumulation in above-ground dry matter of irrigated rice with
harvest index 0.4. Predicted reciprocal internal efficiencies (RIEs) at 60% to
70% of yield potential corresponded to plant accumulation of 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P,
and 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain yield. These RIEs enable determination of plant
requirements for K and P and net output of K and P in harvested grain and
removed crop residues at a target yield. Yield gains for nutrient applied to
irrigated rice averaged 12% for K and 9% for P for 525 to 531 observations. For
fields without certain yield gain, fertilizer K and P requirements can be
determined by a partial maintenance approach (i.e., fertilizer input < output in
nutrient balance), which considers nutrient supply mediated through soil
processes and balances trade-offs between financial loss with full maintenance
rates and risk of excessive nutrient depletion without nutrient application. When
yield gains to an added nutrient are certain, partial maintenance plus yield gain
can be used to determine fertilizer requirements. The SSNM-based approach and
algorithms enable rapid development of field-specific K and P management.

**Introduction**



Rice ( _Oryza sativa_ L.) is the main staple food crop in Asia, which accounts for
about 90% of global rice production. Irrigated rice covers half the rice-growing
area and accounts for about 75% of total rice production (Maclean et al. 2002).
Continuous rice cultivation with two and occasionally three crops per year is
common in tropical Asia. Rice in rotation with other crops, particularly wheat
( _Triticum aestivum_ L.), is common in subtropical Asia (Ladha et al. 2009), and
the rotation of maize ( _Zea mays_ L.) with irrigated rice is increasing in importance
inAsia (Ali et al. 2008). Fertilizer use has contributed to increasing production of
rice-based systems since the Green Revolution, and the effective use of
supplemental nutrients remains vital for essential increases in the production of
rice and associated cereal staples to meet rising demand for food security and
political stability.
Plots of land for cultivation of rice-based cropping systems in Asia are
typically small and spatially variable in management. Large variations in nutrient
balances and nutrient requirements can exist across small distances within a
landscape due to differences in retention of crop residues, historical fertilizer use,
input of organic materials, inherent soil fertility, and crop yield attainable with
farmers' management practices. Existing blanket fertilizer recommendations for
large areas or agro-ecological zones fail to account for these variations in crop
needs for supplemental nutrients among fields within small distances.
Approaches and algorithms for tailoring fertilizer requirements to field-specific
needs of crops are necessary to further improve productivity and profitability
from fertilizer use.

Algorithms for determining fertilizer recommendations are often derived
from factorial fertilizer trials conducted across multiple locations. Site-specific
nutrient management (SSNM) for rice arose in the mid-1990s as an alternative
approach for dynamic management of nutrients to optimize supply and demand
of a nutrient within a specific field in a particular cropping season (Dobermann et
al. 2004). The SSNM approach reasoned that fertilizer requirements should be
based on more generic relationships such as internal nutrient efficiency, which is
the amount of grain yield produced per unit of nutrient accumulated in aboveground plant dry matter (Witt et al. 1999). The QUEFTS (Quantitative
Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) model developed by Janssen et al.



(1990) was used to provide a generic empirical relationship between grain yield
and nutrient accumulation in rice plants (Witt et al. 1999), which was
subsequently combined with the estimation of attainable yield, nutrient balances,
and probable yield gains from added nutrient to determine field-specific fertilizer
requirements for rice (Witt and Dobermann 2004).
The determination of field-specific fertilizer N requirements in the SSNM
approach for rice has subsequently been modified to use a target agronomic
efficiency of fertilizer N use, which is the increase in yield per unit of fertilizer N
applied, and an estimated field-specific yield gain to applied N (Buresh and Witt
2007; Witt et al. 2007). The determination of fertilizer K and P requirements in
the SSNM approach, on the other hand, has continued to use internal nutrient
efficiency combined with estimates of attainable yield, nutrient balances, and
probable yield gains from added nutrient within specific fields (Witt et al. 2007).
The SSNM approach has recently been applied to wheat (Khurana et al. 2008)
and maize (Witt et al. 2009).
Witt et al. (2007) advocated use of nutrient balances with full maintenance of
soil fertility, in which the applications of fertilizer K and P are sufficient to match
the output of the nutrients. Such an approach does not adjust fertilizer K and P
rates for enhanced availability of nutrients through soil biological, chemical, and
physical processes. Moreover, the application of fertilizer at full maintenance can
result in financial loss when the crop does not respond to the added nutrient. An
increase in farm-gate fertilizer prices relative to the farm-gate price of produce
further increases this financial loss. Failure to apply K or P, on the other hand, can
result in nutrient depletion and eventual loss in yield, which could take a number
of seasons before detection (Abdulrachman et al. 2006). The importance of soil
biological, chemical, and physical processes on nutrient availability and the
dramatic fluctuations in fertilizer prices highlight the need to re-examine full
maintenance approaches for determining fertilizer K and P requirements.
Algorithms are needed for determining fertilizer K and P rates that effectively
consider soil processes and soil characteristics mediating K and P availability and
balance the trade-offs between profitability in the short term and sustainable
productivity in the longer term.
Technological approaches and algorithms for developing fertilizer
requirements tailored to field-specific needs of crops in irrigated rice-based
cropping systems must be based on robust scientific principles applicable across
the field-level variability and diversity of crop-growing conditions. At the same
time, approaches must be relatively simple with minimal characterization or
interviewing of farmers for each field in order to ensure rapid, cost-effective
delivery of field-specific guidelines to millions of small-scale farmers.
Technological approaches and algorithms should strive to draw upon existing
research information in order to avoid delays in reaching farmers with practical
solutions based on scientific principles.

Nutrient balances and fertilizer requirements determined with SSNM for
irrigated rice rely on reciprocal internal efficiency (RIE), which is the amount of
the nutrient in above-ground plant dry matter per tonne of grain production.
Values currently used with SSNM for irrigated rice were derived with the
QUEFTS model by Witt et al. (1999). Given the importance of RIE in
determining fertilizer requirements, there is merit after a decade to re-examine
with a larger data set the robustness of RIEs used for irrigated rice.


The objectives of this study are:
1) To determine, using a large data set for irrigated rice from across Asia, the
relationship between rice grain yield and N, P, and K accumulation in total
above-ground plant dry matter of mature rice, and through this to confirm
RIE values for K and P for use in determining fertilizer requirements for
semi-dwarf irrigated rice;
2) To assess at the field level through K and P nutrient balances the factors,
uncertainties, and emerging trends affecting the determination of fieldspecific fertilizer K and P requirements for rice–rice, rice–wheat, and
rice–maize cropping systems; and
3) To examine and compare revised approaches for calculating field-specific K
and P fertilizer rates that can consider the net effect of soil processes and soil
characteristics mediating K and P availability and balance the trade-offs
between short-term profitability of fertilizer use and longer term
sustainability of the productivity of high-yielding rice-based systems.


We provide alternatives to factorial field trials and rigid nutrient balances for
determining fertilizer K and P requirements. The framework we present does not
specifically consider soil–plant–nutrient interactions and biological processes
mediating nutrient availability.


**Materials and methods**


Internal nutrient efficiencies for rice


The QUEFTS model (Janssen et al. 1990) as modified and described by Witt et al.
(1999) was used with a large data set to develop relationships between grain yield
and nutrient accumulation in total above-ground plant dry matter of rice at
maturity. The data originated from irrigated rice production areas in seven
countries across tropical and subtropical environments in Asia (Table 1). Data for
rice grain yield, harvest index, and plant accumulation of N, P, and K were
compiled from various research projects and then grouped into separate data sets
for N, P, and K. The data set for each nutrient contained results from all plots with
measurements for both plant accumulation of the nutrient and grain yield
(Table 1).

a HI�=�harvest�index


In each of the seven countries, except Thailand, data originated from both
nutrient omission trials and fertilizer evaluation trials conducted in farmers'

fields. Data from Bangladesh originated from research described by Alam et al.
(2005). Data from on-farm trials before 2001 in other countries originated from
the Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity project (Dobermann et al. 2002).
On-farm data from 2001 onward originated from the subsequent Reaching
Toward Optimal Productivity project in which SSNM was further refined into
guidelines for rice fertilization (Witt et al. 2007). Data from on-station
experiments in the Philippines originated from several long-term experiments
that included treatments without application of N, P, or K but ample application
of other nutrients to meet crop needs. All data were for irrigated rice, and water
rarely limited plant growth. In all cases semi-dwarf, modern high-yielding indica
cultivars were grown with good agronomic practices. Comparable
methodologies for plant sampling, yield determination, and analysis for plant
nutrients were used for collected data across the countries and experiments (Witt
et al. 1999).
Internal nutrient efficiency (IE) is defined as the amount of grain yield in kg
ha (adjusted to 0.14 g water g fresh weight) produced per kg of plant N, P, or K –1 –1
accumulation in above-ground plant dry matter expressed on an oven dry basis.
Reciprocal internal efficiency (RIE) is the amount of N, P, or K in the aboveground plant dry matter per 1000 kg of grain production. Harvest index is grain



346 347


yield expressed as a proportion of total above-ground plant dry matter (kg grain
per kg total above-ground dry matter).
Relationships between grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation as
predicted by QUEFTS follow a linear-parabolic-plateau model, which depends
on an established maximum yield potential and coefficients of maximum nutrient
accumulation (a) and maximum nutrient dilution (d). The a and d coefficients
used in this paper were the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the measured IE (Witt et
al. 1999). The predicted model is linear up to about 60% to 70% of the yield
potential, which is seldom exceeded in farmers' fields. Internal nutrient
efficiencies determined from the linear portion of the model represent the amount
of nutrient needed to achieve a grain yield for modern high-yielding rice cultivars
across a wide range of yields attainable in farmers' fields (Witt et al. 1999).
The RIEs obtained for a data set with the QUEFTS model are intended for
use in calculating nutrient balances and fertilizer rates for modern high-yielding
rice cultivars (Witt and Dobermann 2004) grown in farmers' fields with good
agronomic practices and balanced use of N, P, and K fertilizers. We therefore
excluded from analysis with QUEFTS the data from plots either with suspected
yield loss due to pests and disease or known to have unbalanced application of
fertilizer.

Harvest index for the entire data set ranged from 0.2 to 0.63. Low harvest
indices suggest that disease, weeds, or insect pests resulted in some yield loss.
Like Witt et al. (1999) and Haefele et al. (2003), we excluded data with harvest
index <0.4 from the determination of relationships and internal nutrient
efficiencies with QUEFTS for semi-dwarf irrigated rice. About 5% of the
observations in the entire data set had harvest index <0.4 (Table 1).
Mean and median RIE for N, P, and K are consistently lower for rice grown
without addition of the nutrient (nutrient omission plots) than with full
fertilization due to dilution of the nutrient in plants not fertilized with the nutrient
(Table 2). We therefore excluded all nutrient omission plot data from the analysis
with QUEFTS. Data from NPK fertilized plots with harvest index from 0.4 to
0.63 as summarized in Table 2 were used to develop relationships and determine
RIE with QUEFTS.


Determination of K and P balances


Simple nutrient balances for K and P in the absence of fertilizer input were
determined for a single rice crop, one rice–wheat cropping cycle, and one
rice–maize cropping cycle. The balances took into account the fraction of
retained crop residue and the inputs of nutrient from irrigation water and added
organic materials.
K balance for rice = K + K W OM + K CRr – K – (GY x RIE ) L r Kr [1]

The K and P nutrient balances reported in this study used K and P harvest
indices (HI = 0.15 and HI = 0.7) for rice that were determined from NPK K P
fertilized plots in this study (Table 4). Nutrient balances reported in this study
with wheat and maize used HI = 0.2 for wheat and maize, HI = 0.6 for wheat, K P
and HI = 0.85 for maize because they approximate values obtained from P
relatively large data sets from multiple locations. In a data set for wheat from
Bangladesh and India with 305 observations for K and 323 observations for P, the
median HI = 0.22 and the median HI = 0.60 (IPNI, unpublished data). In a data K P

2363 observations for P compiled from Nebraska in the USA, Indonesia, and
Vietnam (Setiyono et al. 2010). The RIEs were obtained at 80% of yield potential
because this yield level is attainable with hybrid maize in farmers' fields in

Determination of fertilizer K and P rates



The principles of QUEFTS can be used to determine fertilizer P and K
requirements to achieve a targeted yield through approaches based on either
expected yield gain from the added nutrient or estimated nutrient balance (Witt
and Dobermann 2004). In the yield gain approach, the fertilizer K (FK) or
fertilizer P (FP) (in kg ha��) required to achieve a targeted yield (GY, expressed in –1
t ha��) is a function of the expected yield gain from the added nutrient, the RIE for –1
the nutrient, and the use efficiency of the applied nutrient:
FK = (GY – GY ) x RIE /RE 0K K [7]
FP = (GY – GY ) x RIE /RE 0P P [8]
where GY 0K and GY are grain yield in t ha in the respective nutrient omission 0P –1

with QUEFTS (Table 3), and use efficiency is the recovery efficiency of the


–1

applied nutrient (RE or RE ) expressed in kg kg��. Because RIE is a constant to K P
only 60% to 70% of yield potential, the targeted grain yield should not exceed
about 70% of the yield potential when RIE is derived from the linear portion of
the QUEFTS model. Current yields of irrigated rice in Asia are generally below
70% of yield potential (Dobermann et al. 2002).
Witt and Dobermann (2004), using a data set for irrigated rice from across


–1

Asia, observed RE ranging from 0.35 to 0.66 kg kg and RE ranging from 0.22 K P
to 0.35 kg kg between the median and the 75% quartile. Using these values –1
together with RIE reported in Witt et al. (1999), they estimated as a general rule
that 25 kg K or 9 kg P are required to raise the respective nutrient-limited yield by
1 t ha��. The data set used by Witt and Dobermann (2004) did not include highly –1
weathered soils (i.e., Oxisols and Ultisols) and volcanic soils (i.e., Andisols) with
high capacity to fix P. P-fixing soils would likely have lower RE P and
corresponding higher fertilizer P requirements.
Expected yield gains from the addition of a nutrient (GY – GY�) as obtained 0
with the nutrient omission plot technique can be used to determine the need of a
crop for fertilizer. We used results from 525 K omission plot trials and 531 P
omission plot trials conducted in farmers' fields in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,
and Vietnam (Table 1) to estimate the gain in rice yield from K and P fertilization.
The yield gain from application of K or P was determined from the difference in
grain yield between a plot with full fertilization of N, P, and K at sufficiently high
rates to avoid limitation of these nutrients and an adjacent plot without
application of K or P (i.e., a nutrient omission plot) but with sufficient amounts of
other nutrients to prevent their limitations on yield. The full-fertilized and
nutrient omission plots in a given field were managed identically except for the
omission of the nutrient of interest in plots without K or P. The difference in grain
yield between the full-fertilized plot and the nutrient omission plot represents the
expected yield gain from addition of the nutrient to overcome the deficit between
the crop demand for the nutrient and indigenous supply of the nutrient from
sources other than fertilizer.

Fertilizer K and P requirements to achieve a targeted yield can also be
estimated with QUEFTS principles through nutrient input-output balances. Witt
and Dobermann (2004) used the following equations based on nutrient balance to
estimate fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) requirements (in kg ha��) for a crop –1
with full maintenance of soil K and P.

FK = (GY x RIE ) + ((GY – GY ) x RIE ) – K K 0K K CR – K – K W OM + K L [9]
FP = (GY x RIE ) + ((GY – GY ) x RIE ) – P P 0P P CR – P OM [10]
where K CR and P CR are K and P inputs with retained residues, and other inputs and
losses are as defined for equations 1 to 4. Inputs and losses are all expressed in kg

ha��. Witt and Dobermann (2004) included the expected yield gain from addition
of a nutrient (GY – GY�) in the determination of fertilizer requirements to ensure 0
that fertilizer K and P rates in the presence of a yield gain were increased by the
amount of the nutrient uptake deficit to slowly build up soil nutrient supplies.
In our study we did not include yield gain in the estimation of fertilizer K and
P based on a nutrient balance approach. We examined two options using nutrient
balances to calculate fertilizer K and P rates based on partial maintenance with
gradual drawdown or depletion of soil K and P rather than full maintenance of
soil K and P. In one option with partial maintenance, fertilizer K and P
requirements are calculated as a fraction of full maintenance (FM) as shown in
equations 11 and 12.
FK with fractional K depletion = (GY x RIE – K K CR – K – K W OM + K ) xFM[11] L
FP with fractional P depletion = (GY x RIE – P P CR – P OM ) xFM [12]
The other option with partial maintenance allows drawdown of K or P from


–1

soil reserves up to a threshold limit (K or P in kg ha��), which is treated as an S S
input in the nutrient balance.
FK with limited K depletion = GY x RIE – K K CR – K – K W OM – K + S [13]
FP with limited P depletion = GY x RIE – P P CR – P OM –P S [14]
The FM, K, and P terms can be used to estimate the net effect of soil biological, S S
chemical, and physical processes and soil characteristics on supply of soil K and
P. When FM = 1 or when K or P = 0, the calculated fertilizer rates for a nutrient S S

ensure full maintenance with no drawdown of the nutrient from soil reserves.

We also combined the partial maintenance and yield gain approaches for
determining fertilizer K and P when crop response to the nutrient is certain.

QUEFTS using data from NPK fertilizer plots with harvest index = 0.4 to 0.63
(Table 2) are shown in Fig. 1abc. The yield potential (10 t ha��) and the limits for –1
data exclusion (upper and lower 2.5 percentiles) used to determine the functions
relating grain yield to the maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) of a
nutrient are identical to those used by Witt et al. (1999) (Table 3). The IE at
maximum accumulation (a) of a nutrient (Table 3) represents the slope of the
lower boundary line in Fig. 1, whereas the IE at maximum dilution (d) of a
nutrient (Table 3) represents the slope of the upper boundary line in Fig. 1.
Observations from nutrient omission plots are shown for no added N in Fig.
1d, no added P in Fig. 1e, and no added K in Fig. 1f. In each case the presented
boundary lines and QUEFTS model were derived using data from NPK fertilized
plots (Table 3). In the absence of a nutrient, many observations concentrated near



the upper boundary line for IE, which generally reflects severe nutrient
–1 deficiency. High IE for a nutrient in plots where the nutrient is omitted (Fig. 1def)
corresponds to markedly lower RIE for nutrient omission plots than for NPK
fertilized plots (Table 2). For P and K about 5% of the total plot-level
observations were from nutrient omission plots. In these cases, the inclusion of
nutrient omission plots in the data set had no pronounced effect on the calculated
RIE. For N, for which 14% of the total plot-level observations were from N
omission plots, the inclusion of N omission plots in the data set reduced the
calculated RIE by 3% (Table 2).
The IEs for N, P, and K were relatively low at low harvest indices (Fig. 2). At
harvest index = 0.2 to 0.4, many observations for the relationship of grain yield
and plant N, P, or K were concentrated near the lower boundary line determined
with QUEFTS using data from NPK fertilizer plots with harvest index = 0.4 to
0.63. Such low IE in the absence of biotic or abiotic stress would reflect excess or

luxuriant plant uptake of a nutrient. In this study with semi-dwarf, modern highyielding rice cultivars, the low harvest indices probably arose from loss in grain
yield relative to dry matter production due to non-nutrient constraints such as
disease, insect pests, or water deficit. As harvest index increased, the
observations increasingly concentrated nearer to the QUEFTS-derived
relationship for grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation (Fig. 2).


–1

as The RIEs for N, P, and K increased with decreasing harvest index (Table 5).

The effect of harvest index on RIE was most pronounced for K and least
pronounced for P, reflecting the relatively high proportion of plant K and low
portion of plant P that accumulates in crop residue rather than grain. The reliable
determination of nutrient balances that include nutrient inputs from crop residues
is consequently relatively more reliant on a robust RIE value for K than for P (see
equations 5 and 6).
The RIE estimated as the mean or median of the data set for NPK fertilizer

plots (Table 2) was larger than the RIE derived from the linear portion of the
QUEFTS model (Table 3). QUEFTS predicted the balanced nutrient
accumulation of 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P and 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain across a
range of grain yields up to about 70% of the yield potential. The corresponding
values obtained from means for the entire data set were 16.4 kg N, 3.2 kg P, and
17.8 kg K per tonne of grain (Table 2). The RIEs for nutrients are lower with
QUEFTS because values derived with QUEFTS are from the slope for only the
linear portion of the predicted relationship. This is confirmed by the increase in
RIE predicted by QUEFTS as target yield increases above 60% to 70% of the
yield potential (Table 6).
An objective of this study was to establish a confirmed robust RIE for N, P,
and K for use in calculating nutrient balances and fertilizer rates for semi-dwarf,
high-yielding irrigated rice cultivars grown in farmers' fields with good
agronomic practices and balanced use of nutrient inputs. We therefore sought to

limited by factors other than nutrient supply. The strong influence of harvest

kg K per tonne of grain (data not shown). This suggests that the exclusion of
omission plot data in the QUEFTS analysis is merited because results from
omission plots tend to concentrate at near the upper boundary line for maximum
dilution (Fig. 1def).
The IEs for maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) and the RIEs
obtained with QUEFTS in this study were comparable to values reported by Witt
et al. (1999) using a smaller data set (Table 3).At harvest index of 0.4, which is
common for semi-dwarf, high-yielding rice, the RIE of 14.7 reported by Witt et
al. (1999) remained essentially unchanged at 14.6 kg plant N per tonne of grain,
and the RIE of 2.6 reported by Witt et al. (1999) remained essentially unchanged
at 2.7 kg plant P per tonne of grain. The RIE for K increased slightly from 14.5 to
15.9 kg plant K per tonne of grain (Table 3). The close match between this study
and Witt et al. (1999) confirms the robustness of the RIEs from Witt et al. (1999)
that have been used for a decade to determine fertilizer K and P requirements
within SSNM for rice (Witt et al. 2007).
Nutrient harvest indices are used to determine nutrient balances when

fractions of the crop residues are retained in the field (see equations 5 and 6). The
median nutrient harvest indices obtained from NPK fertilizer plots were 0.63 for
N, 0.69 for P, and 0.15 for K (Table 4). These values for rice are consistent with
reports that grain contains about 60% of the N, 15% to 20% of the K, and about
two-thirds of the P accumulated in above-ground biomass (Dobermann and
Fairhurst 2000).


Nutrient balances in rice-based cropping systems


_Continuous rice cropping_



for rice to be harvested near ground level with little retention of standing biomass
in the field.

The K balances in Fig. 3 with 15% retention of crop residue represent the
frequent situation in South Asia where rice is harvested near ground level, and
crop residue after threshing is not returned to the field but rather used for
alternative purposes such as fodder, fuel, or bedding for animals. Under such
conditions, the crop removal of K increases with increasing grain yield and
exceeds 100 kg K ha above 7 t ha��. The K balances in Fig. 3 with 40% retention –1 –1
of crop residue represent the frequent situation in Southeast Asia, where some
standing biomass is retained in the field at harvest, but crop residue after
threshing is not returned to the field. Combine harvesting with complete retention
of crop residue within fields is practiced in some parts of Asia, and it will likely
increase in importance, especially where the supply of labor is limited.


**Fig. 3** Potassium balances for one rice crop across a range of grain yields as

Continuous rice cultivation with two or three rice crops per year is common
across the tropics of Asia. Rice yields in farmers' fields in the tropics can often
reach 7 to 8 t ha with good agronomic practices in dry seasons with high solar –1
radiation and ample irrigation water. Rice yields in wet seasons typically achieve
only 4 to 6 t ha –1 with good agronomic practices because of reduced solar
radiation and reduced yield potential due to cloudiness. The potential depletion of
soil K reserves due to removal of crop residues is a concern in intensive rice
cropping (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000).
The net export of K during rice cultivation with complete retention of crop
residue is relatively small even at high grain yields, but removal of crop residues
results in substantial export of K (Fig. 3a). Rice in Asia is commonly harvested
manually, and the harvested biomass is then transported to a central location for
threshing. Within Southeast Asia, some standing biomass (i.e., stubble) is
typically retained in the field at harvest, but in South Asia it is relatively common



–1

The K balances in Fig. 3 with 100% retention of crop residue represent fields
with combine harvesting without subsequent removal of crop residue. They also
represent fields with manual harvesting and complete return of crop residue to the
field after threshing. The burning of rice residues, though increasingly banned for
environmental reasons, is still practiced in some locations. Burning of rice
residue spread across a field normally does not result in appreciable loss of K
(Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000); hence, burning of rice residue is neglected as a
factor in the determination of K balances in this study.
The K balances assume negligible leaching loss in Fig. 3 (K in equation 1). L
Rice soils in Asia are typically tilled at or near saturated soil water content during
land preparation by a process called puddling, which destroys soil structure and



358 359


reduces percolation rate and leaching loss of ions, including K (Sharma and De
Datta 1986). My Hoa et al. (2006) reported only 1 to 3 kg K ha loss by leaching –1
during a growing season on puddled soil in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. The
input of K from rainwater by comparison was 6 to 10 kg ha��. Witt and –1
Dobermann (2004) estimated 11 kg K ha loss by leaching and 5 kg K ha input –1 –1
from rainwater in an approximation of K balances for a typical irrigated rice crop
in Asia. Percolation rate and leaching loss are higher on coarse-textured soil with
low cation exchange capacity (Bijay-Singh et al. 2004), but such soils are much
less common for rice–rice cropping systems. We therefore assume that leaching
loss of K approximately matched K input from rainwater and could be treated as
negligible.
Phosphorus balances, unlike K balances, in continuous rice cultivation are
not strongly affected by management of rice residue (Fig. 4a). Only about onethird of the total P in a mature rice plant typically remains in the crop residue after
harvest (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000). The retention of crop residue has only a
small effect on net crop removal of P.All crop residue from rice with 7 t ha grain –1
yield contains only about 5 kg P ha��. –1

Irrigation water from both gravity-fed systems and tube wells typically
contains K, and irrigation can represent an important input of K during rice
production. The input of K with irrigation water depends on both the K
concentration in added water and the quantity of water added during the entire
cropping cycle in rice production from the onset of land preparation to harvest.
The concentration of K in irrigation water, as shown in Table 7, varies within and
among rice-growing areas. The median concentration of K in irrigation water
collected from eight rice-growing areas across six countries across Asia ranged

The total water input from rainfall plus irrigation for one rice-growing cycle
can vary from as little as 400 mm for heavy clay soil with shallow groundwater
tables that supply water to rice by capillary rise to more than 2000 mm for coarsetextured soil with deep groundwater tables. About 1300 to 1500 mm is a general
value for irrigated rice in Asia (Bouman and Tuong 2001; Bouman et al. 2006).
Rainfall can differ markedly between growing seasons in Asian rice production
areas with two or three rice crops per year. During monsoonal wet seasons, much
of the required water can be provided through rainfall. Some irrigated rice areas
do not even receive irrigation in the wet season. In the dry season, on the other
hand, much of the water must be supplied through irrigation.
We assume an addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water during one cropping
cycle. The addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water with 1.8 mg K L, the median –1
K concentration in Table 7, would add 18 kg K ha��. This input of K would –1
increase with increased use of irrigation water, and it would decrease as rainfall
contributed a greater portion of the total required water.
The variability in K concentration of irrigation water leads to uncertainty in
the input of K for a specific rice field. Results for the two locations in the
Philippines in Table 7 illustrate substantial variation in K concentration among
locations within a country. The K concentration in irrigation water ranged from



–1

0.3 to 1.5 mg L for 13 samples from Bohol and from 2.0 to 6.1 mg L for 22
samples from Iloilo (data not shown). The K concentration for 50% of the
samples was 1.2 to 1.4 mg L in Bohol and 3.3 to 4.2 mg L in Iloilo. Assuming –1 –1
an addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water, K input for 50% of the rice fields
would be 12 to 14 kg K ha in the sample area in Bohol and 33 to 42 kg K ha in –1 –1
the sample area in Iloilo. The K inputs for the remaining 50% of rice fields would
fall outside these ranges. The deficit in K balances, and consequently the amount
of fertilizer K needed to maintain a non-negative K balance, would differ by
about 20 to 30 kg K ha between Bohol and Iloilo at comparable rice yields and –1
fractions of retained rice residue.

Results in Table 7 also illustrate substantial variability in K concentration of
irrigation water within a rice-growing area. In the case of the Cauvery Delta in
India, the K concentration in irrigation water for 24 samples ranged from 1.0 to
9.5 mg L (data not shown), and 50% of the samples fell within 1.3 to 3.0 mg L��. –1 –1
Assuming an addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water, K input for rice fields
would range from 10 to 95 kg ha –1 in the sample area with 50% of the fields
receiving 13 to 30 kg ha��. This variability within a rice-growing area highlights –1
the importance of information on K inputs from irrigation water when
determining field-specific fertilizer K rates based on K balances.
The K balances in Fig. 3b assume input of 20 kg K ha from irrigation water, –1
which, based on results in Table 7, appears likely for irrigated rice in seasons with
limited rainfall. Complete retention of crop residue with such input of K from
irrigation water results in near neutral K balances even at high rice yields. This
suggests that K deficiency is unlikely in continuous cultivation of irrigated rice
with continual retention of all rice residue, use of irrigation water containing 2
mg K L��, and negligible K loss by leaching. –1
Irrigation water normally contains negligible P. The P concentration in
irrigation water samples reported in Table 7 was consistently <0.1 mg L (data –1
not shown). Irrigation water is consequently not considered a source of
significant P in rice–rice cropping systems.
Integrated use of organic materials with manufactured chemical fertilizers is
recommended in some rice-growing areas (Mamaril et al. 2009). Organic
materials such as composted animal manure and green manures contain K (Witt
et al. 2007; Mamaril et al. 2009), which contribute to K balances and the supply
of plant-available K to rice crops. The K balances in Fig. 3c assume input of 20 kg
K ha –1 from organic material, corresponding to 2 t ha –1 with 10 g K kg��, in –1
addition to 20 kg K ha –1 from irrigation water. The K deficits and hence likely
need for fertilizer K are greatest at high rice yields, especially when little or no
crop residue is retained.
Organic materials at common levels of availability and application are
unlikely to eliminate deficits in K balances at relatively high rice yields when



–1

crop residue is only partially retained. But, at lower rice yields such as <5 t ha��,
which are common for wet seasons, the application of organic materials with
partial retention of crop residues can result in near neutral K balances (Fig. 3c).
When all crop residue is retained, the application of organic materials can result
in positive K balances across all rice yields (Fig. 3c).
The P from added organic materials can have a marked effect on P balances.
The input of 10 kg P ha from organic material, corresponding to 2 t ha with 5 g –1 –1
P kg��, can eliminate deficits in P balances at rice yields of <5 t ha –1 –1 (Fig. 4b).
Organic P in added organic materials must be converted to phosphate during
decomposition of the organic material to become plant available. As a result of
this delayed release of plant-available P from organic materials, a relatively
smaller fraction of added P from organic material than from manufactured
chemical fertilizer would likely be taken up by rice in the season when P is
applied.

The rice–wheat cropping system is common in the subtropics of South Asia and
China. It is the main cereal system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South
Asia, where it is practiced on 13.5 million ha across Bangladesh, India, Nepal,
and Pakistan. In the northwestern part of the IGP, the rice–wheat system is highly
intensive with liberal and often excessive use of irrigation water. There are
increasing concerns regarding the sustainability of the system in the northwestern
IGP due to low use-efficiency of inputs, including fertilizers, depletion of
irrigation water, and degradation of soil resources (Ladha et al. 2009).
In Northwest India, within the northwestern part of the IGP, the groundwater
used for irrigation of rice–wheat is relatively high in K. Reported K
concentrations for 242 samples from tube wells in the central plain region of the
state of Punjab in Northwest India ranged from 0.87 to 38.2 mg L with a mean of –1
5.1 mg L –1 (Pasricha et al. 2001). This corresponded to an estimated input of
about 80 kg K ha –1 from irrigation water for a rice–wheat system. Canal water
from gravity-fed irrigation is relatively lower in K content than water from tube
wells. Because some farmers use water from both sources during a rice–wheat
cropping cycle (Erenstein 2009), the input of K with irrigation water depends on
source as well as the amount of added water.

Soils for rice–wheat cropping in the northwestern IGP are light textured with
rapid loss of water by percolation. An abundance of electric and diesel tube wells
has enabled considerable extraction of groundwater for rice–wheat production
(Erenstein 2009). A survey of farmers at sites in Haryana, India and Punjab,
Pakistan revealed use of about 1600 to 1900 mm irrigation water during one rice
production cycle (Erenstein 2009). Much less irrigation water, approximating

200 to 300 mm, is used for wheat production (Khurana et al. 2008; Erenstein
2009). Use for one rice–wheat cropping cycle of an estimated 2000 mm irrigation
water originating from a tube-well with 5.1 mg K L would result in input of 102 –1
kg K ha from tube well irrigation. This matches with an estimated 100 kg K ha –1 –1


–1

yr from irrigation water reported in a long-term rice–wheat experiment at
Ludhiana, Punjab, by Bijay-Singh et al. (2004) in a review of literature. A
fraction of the added K would likely be lost from the crop rooting zone through
leaching. An annual input of 75 kg K ha from irrigation water is therefore used –1
in Fig. 5 as a plausible net K input for a typical rice–wheat cropping system in
Northwest India.

Soil K in addition to K from irrigation water can be lost by leaching.
Leaching loss of soil K can be an important output in K balances on soils with
relatively high release of K from nonexchangeable pools and minerals, leading to
high concentrations of K in soil solution lost by percolation (Haefele 2001).
Bijay-Singh et al. (2004), in a review of literature, estimated an annual K
leaching loss of 19 to 31 kg ha��, depending on inputs of K, from a rice–wheat –1
system on light-textured soil in Punjab. The estimated annual K input from
rainwater was 5 kg ha��. Annual leaching loss of 20 kg K ha is therefore used in –1 –1
Fig. 5 to approximate total leaching loss of soil K minus the small input of K from
rainwater.

plausible high net input of K with irrigation water. The low net K input of 25 kg
ha in Fig. 5 represents the use of water-saving technology leading to substantial –1
savings in total water use, enabling the use of primarily canal water rather than
tube-well water for irrigation.
Wheat residue is often removed from the field for use as fodder in Northwest

India, whereas rice residue is less valuable for fodder and is often partially or
completely retained in the field (Mandal et al. 2004). The K balances in Fig. 5a
with 15% retention of both rice and wheat residue represent removal of all aboveground crop biomass except for small standing biomass near ground level. Under
such conditions, K balances are negative across all rice grain yields even with
high input of K from irrigation water.
The K balances in Fig. 5b with 15% retention of wheat residue and 100%
retention of rice residue represent a relatively common situation with removal of
wheat residue but complete retention of rice residue such as after combine
harvesting. Under such conditions, the K balance is near neutral across all rice
grain yields with net input of 125 kg K ha –1 from irrigation water. Annual K
balances are somewhat negative (–50 to –60 kg K ha��) with a plausible common –1
net input of 75 kg K ha –1 from irrigation water. Soils in this region have an
inherent capacity to release K (Bijay-Singh et al. 2004). The retention of some
crop residue, use of relatively large amounts of irrigation water from tube wells,
and net release of K from soil reserves could contribute to the commonly
observed absence of crop response to applied K (Khurana et al. 2008). The
burning of rice residue would likely not have much effect on the K balances
because residue spread across a field normally does not result in appreciable loss
of K (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000).
The use of water-saving technologies that markedly reduce K inputs from
irrigation (e.g., input = 25 kg K ha in Fig. 5b) would result in more negative K –1
balances, suggesting that water-saving technologies could increase the likelihood
of K deficiency even when rice residue is retained. Water-saving technologies
could be combined with retention of wheat residue (Fig. 5c) or use of fertilizer K
to compensate for reduced input of K from irrigation water. The value of wheat
residue for fodder and uses other than a supply of K would need to be assessed
relative to the cost of fertilizer K to determine the potential attractiveness of
wheat residue as a source of K. Our analysis suggests that variation in irrigation
and residue management among fields can strongly affect K balances, which
could have a considerable effect on the estimation of field-specific fertilizer K
rates in the rice–wheat system.
The P balances in the rice–wheat system are consistently negative regardless
of the quantity of retained crop residue (Fig. 6). The retention of crop residue
has less effect on P than K balances because a much smaller fraction of the plant
P than K remains in crop residue after harvest. The net removal of P in one

As reported by Pasricha et al. (2001), K concentrations in tube-well water

_Rice–maize system_


The rice–maize cropping system in irrigated lowlands is gaining importance
across tropical and subtropical Asia in response to increasing demand of maize
for feed and biofuel. Rice is a well-adapted crop in lowlands in the wet season,
but maize can replace rice in the drier or cooler season, especially when
marketing opportunities are attractive for maize or irrigation water is limited for
rice production (Ali et al. 2008).
The nutrient balances for one rice–maize cycle in Fig. 7 represent common
management for a rice–maize system with removal of nearly all above-ground
biomass (residue retention = 15%) and retention of some standing rice biomass
after harvest (residue retention = 40%). Maize residue is typically not retained
because it is difficult to incorporate during tillage for rice production and the
incorporated residue with its high C-to-N ratio can lead to immobilization of N
during decomposition. The K input from irrigation water is assumed to be only 25
kg ha because the rice–maize system, unlike rice–wheat in Northwest India, is –1
not common in areas with high application to rice of tube-well water high in K.
Leaching loss of K is assumed to be negligible.



Nutrient balances for the rice–maize system are strongly affected by the
yield of maize (Fig. 7). Hybrid maize in a rice–maize system can achieve a yield
up to 12 t ha –1 with good management practices and a sufficient supply of
nutrients in farmers' fields (IPNI, unpublished data), which is markedly higher
than the achievable yield for either rice or wheat in the same season. At 12 t ha –1
maize grain, there is a net export of about 200 kg K ha and 40 kg P ha for one –1 –1
rice–maize cropping cycle with common residue management practices and
production of 5 t ha rice grain (Fig. 7). The rice–maize system with high maize –1
yield is more extractive of nutrients than rice–rice and rice–wheat systems.
The retention of maize residues can markedly reduce the net export from a
rice–maize cropping system of K but not P (Fig. 8). In the rice–maize cropping
system, rice is typically grown in the wet season when rice yield is often lower
than in the dry season. The nutrient balances in Fig. 8 consequently assume a rice
yield of only 5 t ha –1 in the wet season. Retention of maize residues markedly
reduces but does not eliminate the deficit in K balances when rice residue is not

retained (Fig. 8a). Retention of all maize and rice residues is required to achieve
near-neutral K balances (Fig. 8b).
Retention of rice residues is feasible through either combine harvesting or
manual harvesting with retention of standing biomass. Retention of maize
residue is problematic because it increases the energy required for tillage before
rice. Incorporation of maize residue due to its high C-to-N ratio can also have
short-term negative effects on N availability to rice due to N immobilization
(Buresh et al. 2008). Establishment of rice with mulching of the maize residue

Determination of fertilizer K and P rates


_Yield gain approach_


Results from over 500 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted with irrigated
rice in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam (Table 1) are presented in Fig.
9 to provide an example of yield gains attainable for rice from K and P
fertilization in Asia. Grain yields without K or without P increased in direct
proportion to yields with full fertilization throughout the range in yields from 3 to
9 t ha��. Yield gains expressed as a fraction of the yield with full fertilization –1
averaged 12% (slope = 0.88) for K and 9% (slope = 0.91) for P.

and Vietnam



rather than tillage to incorporate maize residue, such as through direct dry
seeding, might provide an alternative to facilitate retention of maize residues in
the rice–maize system. In the absence of technologies to facilitate retention of
maize residue, higher K deficits and hence higher fertilizer K requirements are
likely for the rice–maize system with high-yielding hybrid maize than for the
rice–rice or rice–wheat system.
The P balances are affected more by maize yield than by management of
maize and rice residues. The P deficits and hence likely need for fertilizer P
increase in direct proportion to the yield of maize (Fig. 8cd).



In the yield gain approach for determining fertilizer K and P requirements,
fertilizer K and P are applied only when a crop response to the nutrient is certain.
As shown in Fig. 9, the yield gain for irrigated rice from added K or P is often
relatively small to moderate, averaging near 10%. We therefore present yield gains
of 5%, 10% and 20% in an illustration of fertilizer K and P rates and balances
across the feasible range of irrigated rice yields from 3 to 9 t ha (Fig. 10). –1
Fertilizer K and P rates were determined using equations 7 and 8 in which
yield gain (GY – GY ) at a targeted yield with full fertilization (GY) was 0
determined as the respective fraction (5%, 10%, or 20%) of GY. We used RIEs for
K (15.9) and P (2.7) as determined by QUEFTS (Table 3) and recovery efficiencies

of K (RE = 0.64) and P (RE = 0.3) that correspond to about the 70% quartile for K P
values obtained by Witt and Dobermann (2004) from a large data set for irrigated
rice in Asia. Fertilizer requirements corresponded to 25 kg K ha and 9 kg P ha to –1 –1
raise the respective nutrient-limited yield by 1 t ha . In the estimation of K and P –1
balances in Fig. 10, we assumed 40% retention of rice residue (CRR = 0.4 in
equations 5 and 6) and 20 kg K ha –1 net input from irrigation water, which
approximates a likely median value for dry-season rice among sites shown in Table
7. Leaching loss of K is assumed to be negligible.
Fertilizer K and P requirements determined by the yield gain approach
(equations 7 and 8) increased with increasing target yield (Fig. 10ac), but the K
and P rates did not increase sufficiently fast to prevent increasing depletion of soil



fertility with increasing yield within the ranges of yield gain common for
irrigated rice (Fig. 10bd). The same trends of increasing fertilizer rates and
decreasing nutrient balances with increasing yield occur when lower recovery
efficiencies (RE K = 0.35 and RE = 0.22) corresponding to median values P
reported by Witt and Dobermann (2004) were used to determine fertilizer
requirements (data not shown).
A distinctly undesirable feature of fertilizer K and P rates determined by the
yield gain approach is higher K and P depletion at high than low target yields.
This could accelerate the onset of nutrient limitations and subsequent declines in
productivity in existing high-yielding areas. For both K and P, the slope for
estimated nutrient balances with increasing yield became less negative as yield
gain increased from 5% to 20%. Yield gains >20%, which are not common for
irrigated rice (Fig. 9), would be required to obtain slope = 0 (Fig. 10), at which
point nutrient depletion would be constant across yields.
Although Fig. 10 presents results for rice, the same trends would apply to
wheat and maize. Cereal-growing areas with high-yielding crops and relatively
small current yield gain from K and P fertilization — and hence low fertilizer K
and P recommendations based on a yield gain approach — would be particularly
prone to nutrient mining and risk of declining productivity. For K, because of the
large portion of total plant K in crop residues, the risk would be greater in highyielding fields with removal than with retention of crop residues. Locations with
existing large yield gains from K and P fertilization would be relatively less at
risk of further K and P mining from fertilizer K and P recommendations based
solely on a yield gain approach.
The determination of fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) (in kg ha��) required –1
to achieve a targeted yield (GY, expressed in t ha��) by the yield gain approach can –1
be simplified by replacing RIE/RE in equations 7 and 8 with a target agronomic
efficiency (AE) for the nutrient:
FK = (GY – GY ) x 1000/AE 0K K [19]
FP = (GY – GY ) x 1000/AE 0P P [20]
where agronomic efficiency of the applied nutrient (AE or AE ) is expressed as K P
kg increase in grain yield per kgapplied nutrient. The determination with SSNM
of fertilizer N requirements uses a comparable yield gain approach with
agronomic efficiency (Witt et al. 2007). The target fertilizer requirements of 25
kg K and 9 kg P to raise the respective nutrient-limited yield by 1 t ha –1


–1 –1

correspond to AE = 40 kg kg and AE = 110 kg kg��. This AE is derived from a K P P
data set without P-fixing soils, and it would likely be lower for soils with high
capacity to fix P.

input-output balances provides an alternative to the yield gain approach for
determining fertilizer K and P requirements. With full maintenance (FM = 1 in
equations 11 and 12), the fertilizer K or P rates match removal of K or P, ensuring
no nutrient depletion (depletion = 0 in Fig. 11). Full maintenance rates of a
nutrient fail to consider enhanced nutrient availability from soil biological,
chemical, and physical processes. They can also result in short-term financial loss
for farmers when the yield gain resulting from application of the nutrient is
negligible or small. But, failure to apply the nutrient leads to nutrient depletion,
which might eventually lead to yield loss. Application of fertilizer K and P at less
than full (i.e., partial) maintenance rates could then provide an opportunity to
consider the supply of nutrient from soil reserves, including contributions from
biological processes, and better handle the tradeoffs between longer-term


**Fig. 11** Fertilizer K and P rates for rice determined with a nutrient balance
approach allowing three contrasting amounts for K and P depletion. In
each case 40% of rice residue was retained in the field, and K input from

sustained productivity and short-term financial benefit.
One option for determining fertilizer rates at partial maintenance is to allow a
drawdown or depletion of soil nutrient reserves equivalent to a fraction of the
nutrient required for full maintenance of the nutrient input-output balance. This
option, which we refer to as fractional depletion, is illustrated in Fig. 11 for
fertilizer K and P rates determined at 50% of full maintenance (depletion = 50%;
FM = 0.5 in equations 11 and 12). Fertilizer rates increased with increasing target
yield (Fig. 11ac), but the K and P rates did not increase sufficiently fast to prevent
increasing depletion of soil K and P with increasing yield (Fig. 11bd). Nutrient
depletion and risk of declining productivity are higher at high than low target
yields with this option of partial maintenance.
Another option for determining fertilizer rates at partial maintenance is to
allow depletion of a nutrient up to but not beyond a threshold limit (K and P in S S
equations 13 and 14). In this option, which we refer to as limited depletion, the
threshold limit represents the estimated drawdown of soil nutrient reserves that
could be sustained without leading to more nutrient limitations on crop yield. The
allowable drawdown of soil nutrient reserves (FM in fractional depletion option
and K and P in limited depletion option) could depend upon soil processes like S S
soil biological activity as affected by water regime (Turner and Haygarth 2001)
and tillage (Lorenz et al. 2009), equilibrium among nutrient pools (Singh at el.
2002; Saleque et al. 2009), and soil characteristics like mineralogy (Bijay-Singh
et al. 2004). Fig. 11 illustrates conditions in which the limits for drawdown of soil


–1 –1

nutrient reserves were 30 kg K ha (K ) and 8 kg P ha S (P ). Rice residue S
retention was 40%, net K input from irrigation water was 20 kg ha��, and leaching –1
loss of K was negligible.
With the limited depletion option, fertilizer rates (Fig. 11ac) are calculated
such that nutrient balances (Fig. 11bd) are never more negative than the limit for
drawdown of soil nutrient reserves (K S and P ). No fertilizer K or P is S
recommended at low yields (Fig. 11bd). Fertilizer K or P is recommended only
above the yield at which the net output of the nutrient in the nutrient balance
exceeds K or P (equations 13 and 14). The relatively comparable level of S S
nutrient depletion across yields and the absence of increasing nutrient depletion
at high yields make the limited depletion option for partial maintenance
(equations 13 and 14) more attractive than the fractional depletion option
(equations 11 and 12) for determining fertilizer K and P across environments with
widely varying yields.

_Partial maintenance plus yield gain approach_


Use of the partial maintenance approach to determine fertilizer requirements
risks applying insufficient nutrient to meet crop needs when yield gain to the

added nutrient is large, but use of the yield gain approach by itself can result in
nutrient depletion at high yields (Fig. 10bd). A combination of the two
approaches was therefore examined for determining fertilizer requirements when
yield gain from added nutrient is certain.

fertilizer K and P rates and balances for a partial maintenance approach with
fractional depletion (depletion = 50%, FM = 0.5) are compared alone (equations
11 and 12) and in combination with a yield gain approach (equations 15 and 16).
As in Fig 12, yield gain was either set at 20% of attainable yield or at a constant 1
t ha��. As in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, rice residue retention was 40%, net K input from –1
irrigation water was 20 kg ha��, and leaching loss of K was negligible. –1
Fertilizer rates were lowest when determined with only a partial maintenance
approach (Fig. 12ac and 13ac). Combining partial maintenance with a yield gain
approach resulted in higher calculated fertilizer rates and more positive K and P
balances (Fig. 12bd and 13bd). Fertilizer rates with a partial maintenance plus
yield gain approach increased faster with increasing yield when yield gain was
expressed as a fraction of attainable yield (i.e., 20%) rather than as a fixed amount

(i.e., 1 t ha��). The K and P balances as a result were more positive at higher yields
when yield gain was expressed as a fraction of attainable yield (i.e., 20%).
Based on results from nutrient omission plot studies (Fig. 9), the yield gain of
rice from K and P fertilization is directly related to the attainable yield with full
fertilization. Yield gain is consequently better represented across a wide range of
yields as a fraction of the attainable yield (i.e., 20% in Fig. 12 and 13) rather than
a fixed amount (i.e., 1 t ha��). Based on data in Fig. 9, for example, at 5 t ha –1 –1
attainable yield with full fertilization, the mean yield gain was 0.6 t ha –1 for K
application and 0.5 t ha –1 for P application; at 8 t ha –1 attainable yield with full
fertilization, the mean yield gain was 1.0 t ha for K application and 0.7 t ha for –1 –1
P application.
The results suggest that at low rice yields when the yield gain from applied K
or P is relatively small such as 0.5 t ha��, which often corresponds to yields of –1
<5 t ha –1 (Fig. 9), fertilizer requirements can be determined with only a partial
maintenance approach (Fig. 11). When yield gain is more pronounced, a partial
maintenance plus yield gain approach can be considered for determining
fertilizer requirements (Fig. 12 and 13). Expressing yield gain as a fraction of
targeted yield helps ensure a good fit with measured yield gains (Fig. 9), and it
helps ensure that the input of nutrient at higher yields is relatively higher and
sufficient to overcome nutrient deficiencies.

The determination of fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) by a partial
maintenance plus yield gain approach can be simplified by replacing RIE/RE in
equations 15 to 18 with a target agronomic efficiency (AE) of the nutrient.
Equations 15 and 16 for the fractional depletion option become:
FK = ((GY x RIE – K K CR – K – K W OM + K ) x FM) + ((GY – GY ) x 1000/AE ) [21] L 0K K
FP = ((GY x RIE – P P CR – P OM ) x FM) + ((GY – GY ) x 1000/AE ) 0P P [22]
Equations 17 and 18 for the limited depletion option become:
FK = (GY x RIE – K K CR – K – K W OM – K + K ) + ((GY – GY ) x 1000/AE ) [23] S L 0K K
FP = (GY x RIE – P P CR – P OM – P ) + ((GY – GY ) x 1000/AE ) S 0P P [24]

of soil processes and soil characteristics mediating K and P supply when yield
gain from the applied nutrient is uncertain. The use of nutrient balances across a
full range of plausible yields enables fertilizer K and P requirements to be
adjusted for field-specific yield and management, such as amounts of retained
crop residue and applied organic materials, which affect inputs and outputs of K
and P.

The SSNM-based approach for determining fertilizer requirements is well
suited for small, heterogeneous landholdings typical of rice-based cropping
systems in Asia where fertilizer requirements can vary greatly among nearby
fields and the yield gain from applied K or P is often uncertain. Nutrient balances
can provide a pragmatic estimate of nutrient inputs and outputs for a field plot,
which can then be used for determining fertilizer K and P requirements for the
specific field. Numerous practices including tillage, management of crop
residues and organic materials, and water management can influence soil
biological activity and nutrient availability. Their net effect on K and P supply can
be considered through K and P in partial nutrient balances (equations 13, 14, 23, S S
and 24). Research is needed to quantify the net effect of soil processes and soil
characteristics on the sustainable drawdown of soil K and P reserves (K and P ) S S
used in the determination of fertilizer K and P requirements.
Whereas nutrient balances are essential for determining SSNM-based
fertilizer K and P requirements, nutrient balances are not used for determining
SSNM-based fertilizer N requirements. With SSNM, fertilizer N requirements
are based on the yield gain from applied N (Witt et al. 2007) because rice and
other cereal crops in irrigated environments virtually always respond to fertilizer
N. The SSNM-based approach enables yield gain from applied fertilizer N, and
hence total fertilizer N requirement, to be adjusted for management practices. It
also provides decision tools such as the leaf color chart for dynamically adjusting
the application of N during the growing season to match crop needs for
supplemental N (Alam et al. 2005), which can be influenced by the effects of
management on availability of soil N.

**Discussion**


The SSNM-based approach and algorithms we present for determining fertilizer
K and P requirements provide an alternative to soil-test approaches (Slaton et al.
2009) that use algorithms derived from fertilizer response trials conducted across
multiple locations. The SSNM-based approach through the use of nutrient
balances enables the determination of fertilizer K and P requirements when the
yield gain from the applied nutrient is negligible or uncertain (Witt and
Dobermann 2004; Witt et al. 2007), which periodically occurs for irrigated rice
especially at lower yields (Fig. 9). In this paper we revise the SSNM-based
approach to accommodate partial nutrient balances, which consider the net effect



Internal nutrient efficiencies for rice


Field-specific requirements of a cereal crop for fertilizer K and P can be
calculated using RIE to estimate nutrient accumulation by a crop (Witt and
Dobermann 2004). The RIE values obtained for rice in our study using QUEFTS
matched well with RIE values reported by others (Witt et al. 1999; Haefele et al.
2003) for rice with harvest index 0.4, grown with balanced fertilization and
good agronomic management. This consistency in RIE across diverse irrigated
rice-growing environments and cultivars provides confidence that one RIE per
nutrient can be used for semi-dwarf irrigated rice in determining fertilizer P and



376 377


K requirements when fertilization is balanced to match crop needs.
Deviations in RIE from the estimation with QUEFTS arise from unbalanced
plant nutrition leading to either nutrient accumulation associated with luxuriant
uptake of the nutrient or nutrient dilution associated with nutrient deficiency.
Deviations in RIE can also arise from biotic or abiotic stresses that adversely
affect grain production leading to low harvest index. The desired RIE value for
use in determining fertilizer P and K requirements reflects an optimal
accumulation of the nutrients in a mature crop without biotic and abiotic stress.
The RIE increases slightly as targeted yield increases above 60% to 70%
yield potential, which is common in farmers' fields, to 80% of yield potential,
which represents a likely upper limit to profitable rice production (Table 6). But
this change in RIE is relatively small ( 7%) compared to other inherent
uncertainties associated with the determination of fertilizer rates such as

estimation of the attainable yield, yield gain, and some components of the
nutrient balance such as K addition from irrigation water. The use of RIE at 60%
to 70% of yield potential therefore appears appropriate for determing fertilizer
requirements for irrigated rice.
Semi-dwarf, high-yielding irrigated rice without biotic or abiotic stresses has
harvest index 0.4, which was the lower limit of harvest index used by Witt et al.
(1999), Haefele et al. (2003), and our study. We propose that 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P,
and 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain (Table 3) and nutrient harvest indices of HI = K
0.15 and HI = 0.7 (Table 4) obtained from a large data set in our study and P
comparable to values reported by others (Witt et al. 1999, Haefele et al. 2003) can
serve as standards for use in determining nutrient balances and associated P and
K fertilizer rates with semi-dwarf, high-yielding irrigated rice grown with good
agronomic practices and sufficient water. Alternative RIE values would be
required for rice cultivars with harvest index <0.4 (Table 5).
Some rice in rainfed areas can have harvest index <0.4 and corresponding
increased accumulation of plant nutrient in above-ground dry matter per tonne
grain yield. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2008), for example, in a fertilizer trial with
rainfed rice in West Bengal in eastern India, reported mean harvest index = 0.32
and mean accumulation of 33 kg K and 4.3 kg P per tonne of grain. In a multilocation trial in Thailand with 624 observations for traditional tall rice cultivars,
Naklang et al. (2006) reported median harvest index = 0.28 and median plant
accumulation of 48 kg K and 4.7 kg P per tonne of grain. In both studies the rice
yields were relatively low (<4 t ha��). The higher RIE reported for traditional-type –1
rice by Naklang et al. (2006) than found for semi-dwarf modern rice such as in
Witt et al. (1999) and our study resulted from differences in harvest index rather
than differences in tissue concentration of nutrients between the two types of rice.
The RIE estimated from the mean or median of a data set (Table 2) tends to
be higher than the RIE estimated from the linear portion of the QUEFTS model



(Table 3), which reflects a more balanced uptake of nutrient by the crop. We
therefore recommend use of the QUEFTS model with a relatively large data set
from across rice-growing areas to estimate RIE for rice cultivars with harvest
index <0.4. The estimated RIE for K and P can then be used in calculating
nutrient balances and fertilizer rates for rice cultivars — for a given range in
harvest index — grown with balanced use of nutrient inputs and good agronomic
practices. Data from crop-growing situations with either luxuriant uptake of
nutrients, such as arising from excessive fertilization, or nutrient deficiency are
therefore preferably omitted from the data set used with QUEFTS.


Nutrient balances in rice-based cropping systems


Potassium balances in rice-based systems are strongly affected by the attained
crop yield and fraction of crop residue retained, which can vary from field to
field. An immediate opportunity for improving the profitability and effectiveness
of fertilizer K use is consequently to enable field-specific adjustments in fertilizer
K rates based on probable yield and fraction of crop residue retained in a specific
field. Fertilizer K rates for a field could then be further adjusted based on the use
of externally produced organic materials. Whereas organic materials are often
promoted for their N benefit, the K inputs from organic materials can be
overlooked. From the perspective of K balances and maintenance of soil K
fertility, the application of organic materials to rice is more warranted when crop
residues are removed rather than retained. Full retention of rice residue with the

application of organic materials can potentially result in positive K balances (Fig.
3c).
Irrigation water can be an unknown but important input of K in rice
production because of the large quantity of water applied to rice. Uncertainties
associated with K concentration in irrigation water and quantity of added
irrigation water, which can vary from field to field, present a challenge for
improving K management and adjusting fertilizer K rates for field-specific
conditions. The K concentration in irrigation water depends on the source of the
water. It is often higher in water from tube wells than from canals in gravity-fed
irrigation systems (Pasricha et al. 2001), but it can vary among gravity-fed
irrigation systems as illustrated by the contrast between Bohol and Iloilo in the
Philippines (Table 7).
The adjustment of fertilizer K requirements to field-specific yields and
residue retention can be relatively straightforward because farmers know their
field-specific yields and residue management practices. The K input through
irrigation water, on the other hand, will not be known to farmers. An adjustment
in fertilizer K requirements for inputs from irrigation water would likely need to
be made across a region rather than for a specific field. One option could be to
estimate, across an entire gravity-fed irrigation system or across all tube wells in



K



P

a region, a probable net K input based on approximate K concentration of the
water and typical amount of irrigation water used in a cropping season. This
estimated probable K input could then be used to adjust nutrient balance-based K
fertilizer rates across fields for the irrigation system or region. Although such an
adjustment in fertilizer K rates would undoubtedly contain much uncertainty, it
would be superior to the current situation in which net K input from irrigation
water is either ignored or assumed to be constant across a country.
Phosphorus balances in rice and rice-based systems are strongly affected by
attained crop yield. Residue retention has relatively little effect on P balances and
hence fertilizer P requirements determined through nutrient balances because of
the relatively low P content of residue compared with grain. An immediate
opportunity for improving the profitability and effectiveness of fertilizer P use is
consequently to enable field-specific adjustments in fertilizer P rates based on
probable yields.
Fertilizer P rates at the field level could then be further adjusted based on the
use of organic materials, which, when relatively rich in P, can contribute to P
balances (Fig. 4). Uncertainty exists regarding P supply from organic materials
because organic materials can vary greatly not only in P concentration but also in
the rate of release of plant-available P. The supply of P from organic materials at
least in the short term is probably less than from manufactured chemical
fertilizer, in which case one unit of P from organic materials would substitute for
less than a comparable unit of P from manufactured chemical fertilizer. The
effectiveness in replacing P from manufactured chemical fertilizer might
increase, however, through longer-term application of organic materials.
Appropriate adjustment in fertilizer P rates for P supplied by added organic
materials is consequently a challenge.
High input of K through irrigation water together with supply of K from soil
has likely contributed to the long-term production of rice–wheat in Northwest
India (Fig. 5) with little or no response to fertilizer K (Khurana et al. 2008). The
introduction of practices that markedly reduce the use of tube-well water, such as
resource-conserving technologies (Ladha et al. 2009), could lead to more
negative K balances and increased need for fertilizer K (Fig. 5). The monitoring
of changes in K balances and fertilizer K needs arising from the adoption of
water-saving technologies in areas with high use of tube-well water rich in K is
merited.

Potassium deficiencies in the rice–wheat system are more likely in areas with
little K input from irrigation water and limited retention of crop residues.
Although K is high in irrigation water from tube wells in the northwestern IGP
(Pasricha et al. 2001), irrigation water can be lower in K in other rice–wheat areas
of the IGP. Analysis of 21 samples of irrigation water from tube wells in
rice–wheat areas of Uttaranchal, India, for example, revealed relatively low K
concentration ranging from 0.8 to 2.8 mg L��, with a median of 1.3 mg L –1 –1



(unpublished data, IRRI Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity project,
1997–2000). At these K concentrations, the K input from irrigation water for a
rice–wheat cropping cycle would approximate 25 kg ha��, leading to markedly –1
negative K balances regardless of residue retention (Fig. 5).
The rice–maize cropping system, because of the high yields of hybrid maize,
can be a large net exporter of K and P (Fig. 7). The conversion of rice–rice or
rice–wheat to rice–maize cropping could lead to a rapid depletion of soil K and P
if K and P fertilizer are not appropriately adjusted to account for the higher crop
production and plant accumulation of nutrients. Guidelines for determining fieldspecific K and P requirements that optimally balance the trade-offs between
short-term profitability and longer-term sustainable productivity can therefore be
especially important for the emerging high-yielding rice–maize system. Based on
K balances, fertilizer K needs could be particularly high when maize residue is
not retained in the field either because of off-field value such as for fodder or

because it is a nuisance during subsequent tillage and establishment practices for
rice (Fig. 8b).


Determination of fertilizer K and P rates


The established RIE for K and P for a crop (i.e., 2.7 kg P and 15.9 kg K per tonne
of grain for rice, Table 3) can be used to determine fertilizer P and K requirements
that are based on a targeted attainable yield, nutrient balances, and anticipated
yield gain from the added nutrient. When yield gain from an added nutrient is
small or negligible, the application of nutrient would not be recommended with
solely a yield gain approach (equations 7 and 8), but the failure to apply any
nutrient could result in rapid nutrient depletion, especially at high yields (Fig. 10
bd). A nutrient maintenance approach based on nutrient balances, on the other
hand, would recommend application of nutrient even when yield gain is not
certain.

Use of a full maintenance approach (equations 9 and 10) as advocated by
Witt and Dobermann (2004) and Witt et al. (2007) for rice can result in relatively
large applications of the nutrient, which would be unprofitable in the absence of a
yield gain from the added nutrient. A partial maintenance approach, rather than a
full maintenance approach, for determining fertilizer requirements can include an
estimate of nutrient supply as affected by soil processes and soil characteristics
and provide an option to balance the trade-offs between longer-term sustained
productivity and short-term profitability.
The merit of a partial maintenance approach for determining fertilizer K
requirements can be illustrated with results from a long-term fertilizer
experiment with two rice crops per year in West Java, Indonesia (Abdulrachman
et al. 2006). The yield loss from not applying fertilizer K during the initial five
years (10 crops) was not statistically significant or certain to farmers in any



380 381


season. Use of a yield gain approach in such a situation would result in no use of
fertilizer K. Yet, the cumulative yield loss without fertilizer K for the 10 crops
was 3 t ha or 0.3 t ha crop��. Use of a full maintenance approach would result in –1 –1 –1
mean application of about 30 kg K ha for each crop, which could be financially –1
unattractive with probable farm-gate prices for fertilizer and produced rice. Use
of a lower fertilizer K rate based on an estimated sustainable extraction of K from

soil reserves (i.e., partial maintenance using K in equation 13) and considering S
the farm-gate price of harvested rice relative to the farm-gate fertilizer price
could help ensure a balance between short-term profitability and longer-term
sustained productivity without a yield loss due to K deficiency.
We consequently recommend use of a partial maintenance approach for
determining fertilizer K and P requirements when yield gain from an added
nutrient is small or negligible. Based on the results of analyses in our study, we
recommend a partial maintenance approach in which fertilizer rates are
calculated to ensure that the depletion of the nutrient does not exceed a threshold
limit (K and P ) regardless of yield (equations 13 and 14). This avoids the risk of S S
increasing nutrient depletion with increasing yield.
When a detectable yield gain from an added nutrient is certain, an approach
other than solely maintenance or yield gain appears merited. Witt and
Dobermann (2004) and Witt et al. (2007) combined full maintenance of soil
fertility and yield gain approaches to determine fertilizer K and P requirements.
They did not sum the fertilizer rates determined from full maintenance and yield
gain approaches. Rather, they separately calculated fertilizer K or P rates with the
two approaches and then selected the larger of the two calculated values as the
fertilizer requirement. In this fashion the nutrient recommendation was never less
than full maintenance and was potentially higher than full maintenance when
yield gain from the added nutrient was appreciable.
The full maintenance plus yield gain approach of Witt and Dobermann
(2004) and Witt et al. (2007) can result in a relatively large application of nutrient,
which can potentially be unprofitable when farm-gate fertilizer prices are high
relative to the farm-gate price of produced grain and crop response to the nutrient
is modest. Based on the analyses in our study, we consequently recommend a
partial maintenance plus yield gain approach to determine fertilizer requirements
when the crop responds to the added nutrient. The calculated fertilizer
requirement is the sum of the amount determined by partial maintenance and
yield gain (equations 15 to 18 and equations 21 to 24). Calculated fertilizer
requirements can result in positive nutrient balances, but the fertilizer rates can
also result in slightly negative nutrient balances (Fig 12 bd and 13 bd) because
maintenance is only partial. Our analysis highlighted the merit of expressing
yield gain as a fraction of targeted yield rather than an absolute amount, because
measured yield gains from fertilizer K and P across a wide range of yields



–1 –1 –1

S



approximate a fraction of the yield with full fertilization (Fig. 9).
The procedures and algorithms presented for determining fertilizer K and P
requirements for rice can also be used for wheat and maize with appropriate RIEs
determined by QUEFTS for the crops. The threshold limit for nutrient extraction
from soil reserves (K and P ) could differ between rice and wheat or maize S S

because the release of soil nutrients can differ between saturated anaerobic soils

in rice cultivation and aerobic soils in wheat and maize cultivation. Soil

submergence in rice cultivation, for example, tends to increase P availability
(Turner and Gilliam 1976), which might conceivably affect the limit of
sustainable nutrient extraction from soil reserves as well as the yield gain of a
crop from fertilizer P. For rice–wheat and rice–maize systems, this can influence
the optimal distribution of fertilizer P between rice and the non-rice crop in the
rotation (Gill and Meelu 1983).


**Conclusions**


Fertilizer K and P requirements for a specific field can be determined with an
SSNM-based approach using attainable target yield, nutrient balances, and
probable yield gains from added nutrient. One standardized RIE value per
nutrient for a crop facilitates the determination of nutrient balances in the
algorithms. The partial maintenance and partial maintenance plus yield gain
approaches that we have presented can be used in computer-based decision tools
such as Nutrient Manager for Rice (IRRI 2010), which is designed to quickly
provide extension workers, crop advisors, and farmers with fertilizer best
management practices for specific rice fields. Each decision tool consists of
questions readily answered within 15 minutes without the need for soil analysis.
The responses to the questions provide sufficient information to develop fieldspecific fertilizer K and P recommendations using approaches and algorithms we
have described in this paper. The generic SSNM-based principles and algorithms
we presented for K and P are well suited for the rapid development and extension
of field-specific fertilizer recommendations for rice, and they can be readily
adapted for use with wheat and maize.

## **Site specific potassium management in rice based** **cropping systemsinIndia**


**SK�Sanyal** � **MS�Gill** � **K�Majumdar**


**Abstract** Potassium fertility of Indian soils has been on the decline as is evident

from comparative soil test results over the years and increasing response to
potassium application in different crops and soils. Several experimental evidences
showed that potassium balances in rice-based cropping systems are essentially
negative due to deficit application rates of the nutrient compared to its uptake.This
has lead to considerable K mining from soils that is undesirable for long term
sustainability of rice-based systems. Potassium dynamics in soils are governed by
the mineralogy, while the K–supplying capacity of the soils depends on the nature
of the K-bearing minerals and the extent of weathering. Variability in type and
state of weathering of the K-bearing minerals as well as difference in management
history leads to spatial difference in K fertility of soils. The current practice of
applying potassium at a blanket dose without taking into account such variability
is thus limiting crop yield and causing K mining as was evident from long-term
experiments. The concept of site-specific potassium management in rice-based
cropping systems on the other hand provides an approach that takes into account
the K supplying capacity of soils and K requirement of crops while formulating
potassium recommendations. Experimental evidences showed that such an
approach can improve yield and economics of production of rice-based cropping
systems and can reverse the current negativeyield trends.

**Introduction**


Potassium (K) did not receive much attention in India till the '80s because of the
general belief that the Indian soils were well supplied with potassium (Pasricha

and Bansal 2001). However, the picture of crop responses to potassium in India
has been changing with time. Indeed, there is a growing evidence of increasing
deficiency of K as a result of imbalanced use of nitrogen (N) or N and phosphorus
(P). Even under the so-called optimum rates of NPK application in long-term
experiments, the K balance under most of the soil-cropping systems was negative
(Subba-Rao et al. 2001). Such imbalance in potassium application, however, has
variable impact on crop production due to the fact that K-supplying capacities of
soils vary based on mineralogy and dynamics of a particular soil type. So the
current practice of applying potassium at a blanket dose without taking into
account the soil concerned is either limiting crop yield and causing K mining
(deficit K application) or wasting resource that are entirely imported (excess
application). Attaining Food Security had been a major challenge for the nation
since independence. The current stagnation in food grain production necessitates
special initiatives to meet the increasing demands of food grains. Expansion of the
area sown to rice, and crops grown in sequence to it, has ceased to be a major
source of increased output. Most of the targeted increase in production must now
result from greater yield per hectare.Appropriate nutrient management in general
and potassium management in particular, will play a major role in overcoming
stagnation in food grain production. Future strategies for potassium management
need to be more site-specific and dynamic based on a quantitative understanding
of the congruence between nutrient supply and crop demand. The current paper
aims at analyzing the role of site-specific potassium management in improving
productivityof rice-basedcropping sequences.


**Potassium�scenario�in�India**


Potassium (K) has long been a neglected nutrient in Indian agriculture.Analysis of
the fertilizer consumption scenario over the past decades shows that potash
contributed to less that 10% of the total nutrient consumption in the country.
Removal of K in proportion to N is very high in cropping systems, particularly
those involving cereal and fodder crops (Yadav et al. 1998) (Table 1). Potassium
requirements of crops are in general identical to N and 3-5 times higher than P.
However, average K use in India over the last 30 years has been about one-seventh
of N and about one-third of P.

An illustrative balance-sheet of NPK in Indian agriculture (Table 2) shows an
annual depletion of K�O to the tune of 10.20 Mt and 5.97 Mt on gross and net basis, 2
respectively (Tandon 2004). Of the current net negative NPK balance or annual
depletion of 9.7 Mt, 19% is N, 12% Pand 69% K. Such alarming contribution of K
towards the negativebalanceof NPK is a major concern.
Consequence of such imbalanced K application is evident in the information
based on analysis of more than 11 million soil samples that reflect the changing K
fertility status of soils in different parts of the country (Hasan 2002). The
distribution of districts considered low, medium, and high in K fertility show that

out of 371 districts, for which information is available, the respective number of
districts characterized as low, medium, and high are 76, 190, and 105. Thus, 21%
of the districts are low, 51% are medium, and 28% are high, using the nutrient
index values suggested by Ramamurthy and Bajaj (1969). Comparing these
results with those presented earlier by Ghosh and Hasan (1980), the low and high
categories have decreased by 0.6 and 6.4%, respectively, while the medium
category increased by 7 **%.** All this indicates that K fertilizers were scantily
applied in the last two decades as the low category has virtually remained the
same and the high area has fallen.


**Rice-based�cropping�systems**


Rice is the most important crop in India and plays a critical role in food security.
More importantly, it is a choice crop of the millions of poor and small farmers not



390 391


only for income but also for household food security. Intensification and
diversification are two main trends of rice-based cropping systems as they have
evolved in different agro-ecological regions in India where wheat, maize or one of
many other secondary crops are grown during the part of the year when rice was
not in the field. Diversification and intensification of rice-based systems was
advocated to make a breakthrough in productivity and profitability, and several
options with different levels of productivity and profitability were outlined by
(Gill 2006; Gill et al. 2008). The most prevalent cropping systems are rice–rice,
rice– rice–rice, rice–rice–pulse, rice–wheat, rice–oilseed crop, and more recently
rice–maize. The rotation of rice-rice and rice-wheat, for example, are major
agricultural production systems that account for 16 M ha of food grain producing
area in India and are the mainstayof food security in the country.
However, the rice sector has witnessed rapid dynamism in production
processes. After a four-fold increase in production during the past four decades,
the production curves have started showing downward trend and productivity
decelerating since the later half of the 1990s. The productivity decline is
experienced not only in the core green revolution state of Punjab but also in several
other states such as Tamilandu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, etc., including the
rain-fed areas.There are several reasons for such stagnation, the most conspicuous
being wide-scale nutrient depletion through crop harvest, on one hand and low
levelof replenishmentthrough inadequatenutrientsupply, on the other.
Tiwari et al. (2006) in their multi-location trial with rice-wheat system
showed that the average system uptake (rice + wheat) of nutrients over 10 sites


-1 -1

and 2 years was 761 kg of N + P�O + K�O ha year for an average system yield of 2 5 2


-1

13 t ha . The mean uptake of N: P�O�:K�O was in the proportion of 100:29:129. 2 5 2
Similar experiments with rice-rice system across 6 sites and 2 years showed


-1

average uptake of 782 kg of N +P�O + K�O for an average system yield of 12 t ha 2 5 2
with an average uptake ratio of 100:40:133 for N:P�O�:K�O. The mean K uptake 2 5 2
was 1.74 times the K input in case of rice-wheat system, while mean uptake was
62% higher than K input in rice-rice system suggesting net depletion of soil K in all
the sites. The K-omission plots (no external K application) in this study showed
that native potassium supply in rice-wheat system varied from 205 to 354 kg K�O 2
ha year depending on location. In treatments based on K supply exclusively -1 -1
from native sources (K-omission plots), the yield levels supported by sites differed


-1 -1

considerably. Thus, Ranchi with a native supply of 205 kg K�O ha year produced 2
65% lesser system yield (rice-wheat) than did Ludhiana which provided 354 kg


-1 -1

K�O ha year in absence of external supply (Tiwari et al., 2006). Similar results 2
were obtained in rice-rice cropping system by the authors. This suggests that sitespecific potassium application, based on estimation of soil supply and crop
requirement, will be required to support equal levels of yields in rice-based
cropping systems in different locations.

**Mineralogyand K availability**


Potassium availability to plants is regulated in soils by the soluble, exchangeable
and non-exchangeable fractions of K that are interrelated by a dynamic
equilibrium. The driving force for this equilibrium is largely a function of clay
composition, while the magnitude of the process is a function of clay content of
soil. As growing season is limited in most cases, a high growth rate for high yield
can only be maintained with high flux rates of nutrients to the plant roots.
Therefore, mineralogy plays a pivotal role in potassium supplying capacity of a
particular soil (Rao and Rao 1996). The mineral sources of K in soils are the
dioctahedral micas: muscovite, glauconite, and hydrous mica or illite; the
trioctahedral mica, namely biotite and phlogopite and the feldspar, namely
sanidine, orthoclase and microlone (Sarma 1976). Weathering of micas / feldspars
leads to the formation of secondary minerals (such as smectiteor vermiculites), _via_
intermediates like illites, with simultaneous release of K (Sparks and Huang
1985). Results of numerous studies (Sanyal et al. 2009) suggest that for soils of
low intensity of weathering and from trioctahedral mica parent material, K release
to soil solution is rather high as for the crop need and the replenishment of the
exhausted K in soil due to crop removal. For soils of dioctahedral mica parent
material, and a moderate state of weathering or both, K release is less, but it is the
least for soils of low mica content or intensive weathering, or both. Indeed, while
formulating a sound K fertilizer recommendation, it is imperative that the above
characteristicsneed to be taken into account.

Plant uptake of K is related to the weathering of feldspars and micas in soil
environments. Micas are more important than K-feldspars in supplying K to plants
(Rich 1972). The native K status depends, not only on the parent material of soil,
but also on the subsequent stages of weathering of the parent material. So the
weathering history of a mineral phase, rather than its mere presence, may be an
important factor to be reckoned while relating the plant availability of soil K to the
soil mineralogy (Sanyal and Majumdar 2001). An example of such postulate is
provided by a sharp contrast between the Entisol and the Alfisol under rice-based
cropping sequence inWest Bengal (Table 3) where despite having almost the same
amount of illite content, there was a wide variation in total K and nonexchangeable
K (NEK) contents of these soils (Sanyal et al. 2009). This obviously is linked to
the relative stages of weathering of the illitic mineral phase in the given soils
(Sanyal et al. 2009; Ghosh and Sanyal 2006). Such observations have important
bearing to the fertilizer K recommendations to support the different cropping

sequences.
Recently, Chatterjee (2008) found wide variability in soil K fractions in
selected rice growing soils in the alluvial tract of West Bengal. Descriptive
statistics of K fractions in soils of three adjacent blocks of Nadia district showed
wide variability (Table 4). The water soluble and exchangeable form of potassium

matter of concern. Tiwari (1985) observed a decline in available K by 17% and
28% after two crop cycles in the middle Indo-Gangetic plains. Sekhon (1999),
studying K depletions in the soils of Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), showed that six

K K out of eight benchmark soils studied showed considerable decrease in ammonium

acetate and nitric acid soluble K-fractions (denoting the exchangeable and nonexchangeable K fractions, respectively) after 10 years of continuous cultivation
(Table6).

Recent studies on potassium variability (IPNI 2006-07) in the alluvial and red
and lateritic soil zones of West Bengal and Jharkhand showed that variability of
available potassium in soils is quite high among fields within villages (Table 5).
Such short-range variability was attributed to several factors including
fertilization and cropping history as well as resource availability to the farmers
(Sen and Majumdar 2006; Sen et al. 2008).
These experimental observations suggest that due consideration must be
given to the nature and composition of soil minerals while formulating a K
fertilization strategy in rice based systems and any attempt to develop a “one fits
all” strategy will fail to produce the desired improvement in productivity and
profitability, while it will encouragenutrientdepletion.

Decrease in available potassium content of soils, even where K was applied in
both rice and wheat, was observed in long-term experiments progressing at
different locations in IGP (Yadav et al. 2000a). The long-term experiments also
revealed that response to applied potassium increased steadily over the last 20
years as a result of depletion of soil K (Swarup and Srinivasa Rao 1999). Singh et



394 395


al. (2002) in a 8 year rice-wheat cropping system experiment observed that
application of K at 33 kg ha to both the crops caused a negative potassium balance -1
of 103 to 156 kg ha year -1 -1 depending on the rate of N application. Such changes in
K fertility under intensive cropping, however, can also be quite abrupt,
particularly when vegetables are included in the rice-based system. Sen et al.
(2008), while assessing changes in nutrient availability through GIS-based
fertility mapping, found that K fertility in an intensively cultivated village in the
alluvial zone ofWest Bengal decreased perceptibly within two years. For available


-1 -1

K�O, the range changed from 87-448 kg ha in 2006 to 56-375 kg ha in 2008 2
and the mean from 166 kg ha in 2006 to 88 kg ha in 2008. Potassium fertility of -1 -1
the village was generally low to medium in 2006 but the frequency distribution
shifted more towards the low fertility category with a substantial increase in
sample number in the lowest category (Figure 1). The authors found that lower
application of potassium during this period due to unavailability and high uptake
of K by the vegetable crops contributed to this swift decline in K fertility of the
soils.

Consequence of such depletion scenario across the country has led to negative
potassium balance in most cropping systems, including rice-based systems. Ladha
et al. (2003) analyzed yield trends in rice-wheat systems in the IGP, non-IGPareas
of India and China and noted that rice and wheat yields stagnated at 72 and 85% of
long-term experiments where recommended rates of NPK were applied. These

The basic principle of maintaining the fertility status of a soil under high intensity
crop production systems is to annually replenish those nutrients that are removed
from the field. Site specific nutrient management (SSNM) provides an approach
of nutrient management that takes into account 1) nutrient requirement for unit
yield, 2) nutrient contribution from soils, and 3) nutrient contributions required
from fertilizers to formulate fertilizer recommendation. Nutrient use on the

principles of SSNM could provide an avenue to reverse the declining productivity
trend and nutrientminingfrom soils.
Undoubtedly, rice based cereal cropping systems are very exhaustive and
require high quantum of macro, secondary and micronutrients. They are practiced
in a myriad of soil conditions in IGP and non-IGP areas. Variability in nutrient
reserves, nutrient supplying capacity of the soils under these vastly different soil
and climatic conditions and management strategies require that potassium is
applied in a site-specific manner to improve productivity and maintain soil
fertility.
It is well established that crop yields, profit, plant nutrient uptake and nutrient
use efficiencies can be significantly increased by applying fertilizers on a field
specific and crop season specific manner (Bijay-Singh et al. 2003). Fertilizer
K rates predicted by the QUEFTS model (Janssen et al. 1990) to achieve high
yield and maintain soil fertility are usually higher than the rates currently
applied by farmers. Potassium rates in SSNM plots ranged from 50 to 66 kg ha -1
crop while the average farmer fertilizer K rate was 30 kg ha (Bijay-Singh et al. -1 -1
2003).
The findings from a survey conducted by the Project Directorate for Cropping
Systems Research (ICAR), India on the use pattern of nutrients to rice-wheat
system in various sub-regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plains are presented inTable 7.
The economic, social and climatic factors as well as soil and institutional factors
were largely responsible for spatial variation in major nutrients application. The
most conspicuous point to note was the use of potassium in a much imbalanced
manner in both the crops that seems to be the prime factor causing yield stagnation
of rice-wheatsystem in IGP.

authors further reported that fertilizer K rates used were not sufficient to sustain a
neutral K input-output balance in 90% of the long-term experiments, while all the
experiments with significant yield decline had large negative K balances. It is clear
that such negative K balances in soils will adversely affect the sustainability of
rice-based systems and a rational approach of K management, keeping in mind the
variable soil supplying power and nutrient requirements of crops/cropping
systems, will be necessary to reverse the trend.

Recent work on site-specific potassium management (SSKM) by Chatterjee
and Sanyal (2007) across three locations and twelve sites in the alluvial soils of
West Bengal showed significant yield increase in the SSKM plot over the general
recommendation. The K application rate of the SSKM plots were based on
available and non-exchangeable K contents in each site as well as the yield target.
The SSKM plot registered higher K uptake than that for the general
recommendation and farmers' practice, the highest mean residual crop available
potassium in the soil and highest relative agronomic efficiency among the
treatments.Tiwari et al. (2006) working in 17 locations on rice-rice and rice-wheat
systems also showed that economically optimum potassium rates varied
accordingto locations(Table 8).
Potassium application in site-specific manner significantly enhanced the ricewheat system productivity in the above study. The system yield increase was

associated with response rate of 8.9 kg grain kg K�O applied with a Benefit: Cost 2
Ratio (BCR) of 4.3 to 13.5 depending on the location. Pooled data of location and
K rates showed that benefit for K application were 5 or more in 81% cases and 10
or more in 57% cases. In rice-rice system, the response to K application was 5 kg


-1

grain kg K�O.Across the sites, the BCR for K application was 5 or higher in 59% 2
cases. The authors concluded that optimum potash application can increase the
productivity of the rice-rice system by 1300-1900 kg ha and the current general K -1
application rates need upward revision to achieve higher target yields. Gill et al.
(2009) studied the level of response of NPK in major cropping systems across 32
centers located in different agro-climatic zones. The response to potassium in rice
based cropping systems varied from 11.7 to 51.0 kg rice grain equivalent kg -1
nutrient. The oilseeds crops following rice gave response of 17.3 to 24.6 kg rice
grain equivalent kg nutrient, while in rice based cereal cropping systems, the -1
potassium response was confined to the range of 14.0 to 16.2 kg rice grain
equivalentkg ha nutrient(Table9). -1
The reasonably high response to potassium of rice based cropping system is
thus worth noting and application of K seems a necessity for ensuring high grain
yield realization. The highest response to potassium was found in rice-tomato
cropping systems where the response was up to 51 kg rice grain equivalent kg -1
potassium. The economic response to potassium in cereal based cropping system
varied from Rs. 9.4 to 10.6 Rupee invested. The rice followed by oilseed gave -1
economic response in the range of Rs. 5.0 to 17.6 Rupee invested. While in rice- -1
chickpea, the economic response was Rs. 8.3 Rupee -1 invested. The highest
economic response was recorded in rice-tomato (Rs. 24.9 Rupee -1 invested),
thereby clearly advocating the use of potassium as per the recommended dose
(Gill et al. 2009).
Recently Mukhopadhyay et al. (2008), while studying a rice-rice system in
the Terai alluvium, found that omitting potassium from a soil test based

of plant nutrients. The SSNM requires intensive soil sampling and analyses in
order to construct crop- and soil-specific nutrient recommendation. This provides
a major challenge considering the fragmented land holdings in the country as well
as the existing soil testing infrastructure. Geo-statistical analysis and GIS-based
mapping effectively counters that challenge by providing an option to create soil
fertility maps of large areas through interpolation of soil analysis data from a small
number of samples (Sen et al. 2008). Such dynamic maps provide an opportunity
to assess variability in distribution of native nutrients across a large area and thus
aid in strategizing appropriate management of nutrients leading to better yield and
environmental protection. Indeed, in India, where each farm family operates one
or several small field plots, farmers' fertilizer decision making process is
commonly limited by inadequate understanding of soil nutrient status or spatial
nutrient variability of their plots, with such understanding on spatial variability of
soil nutrients in fragmented land-holdings being expected to give a strong impact
on the sustainable development of agriculture in the country.As mentioned earlier,
Sanyal and Chatterjee (2007) revealed that contrast of non-exchangeable
potassium and available potassium status between soils can be effectively utilized
to modify the soil test-based fertilizer recommendation practices for potassium.
Sen and Majumdar (2006) and Sen et al. (2008) documented wide spatial
variability in available nutrient contents of soils even in small areas of intensively
cultivated region of West Bengal. Such studies clearly highlighted the necessity to
comprehensively understand the spatial variability of soil nutrients under the
prevalent small-scale operation systems in India for developing the guidelines for
soil nutrient management and fertilization for optimum production (Sen et al.
2008).

Potassium based nutrient management tested at cultivators' field under theAll
India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Cropping System (2006-07) had
highlighted the response of potassium and sulphur in rice-wheat system. The
average nutrient management options under the existing farmers' crop
management practice (FCM) gave 4.32 to 6.95 t ha paddy yield, which improved -1
by 3 to 25% with recommended management practice at different locations.
Inclusion of K, S and Zn, along with farmers' management, produced extra yield of
0.75 to 1.78 t ha -1 depending on locations. The corresponding response to
potassium over N P clearly demonstrated the major role of potassium towards
enhancement in yield (Table 10). Wheat productivity increased from 0.13 to 0.68 t
ha -1 over farmers' fertilizer management practice (FFP), along with the
corresponding response to potassium application being 0.13 to 0.68 t ha over NP, -1
thereby stressing the fact that yield and response to potassium are variable and K
must be applied in a site-specific manner to improve productivity of rice based
systems.

targeted yield, soil test recommendation, and SSNM for efficient and balanced use

**Conclusions**


Larger proportion of mining in respect of potassium as mentioned in previous
sections partly result from the average crop removal of 1.5 times more K than that
of N and lower K application than N or P, with the misconception that the soils of
the country are relatively rich in potash. Apart from this, relatively low cost per
unit of nitrogen, its widespread availability, and quick and evident response of the
plant has further accentuated such an imbalance. While it will be necessary to
rationalize the use of N fertilizers, ominous signs are that if strategies and policies
are not developed to boost K supplies, and this essential nutrient continues to
remain neglected as in the past, future sustainability of rice-based systems is likely
to be constrained mostly by K. Sustainability of the regions supporting high
intensity cropping and fertilizer responsive strains are foreseen to be the earliest
victims of such imbalance. Besides, our current understanding and interest on soil
quality requires that enough focus is given towards the mining aspects of nutrients
in general and potash in particular.As much as it may seem economically prudent
to apply less potassium from external sources as it is an imported commodity, and
rely more on the inherent potash supplying capacity of the soils, in the long-run it
might turn out to be a very short-sighted approach as we lose the quality of a very
vital resource of our country, our SOILS. Rather a balanced approach that takes
into account soil properties, its potassium supplying capacity and potassium
requirement of crops in the realm of site-specific nutrient management can reverse
the declining production trend, improve the soil quality and thus will leave our
environmentcleanfor the posterity.

**Abstract** Rapid development of information technology provides an opportunity

to improve soil nutrient management by using the advanced technology. In this
study, Ershilipu village of Xinzhou city in Shanxi Province, which encompassed
245 ha and consisted of 443 farmer's plots, was selected as experimental sites to
develop the approach to meet the needs of site-specific nutrient management for
the small scale operation under family responsibility system in China. Two
hundred and eighty plow layer (0-20 cm) soil samples were collected on a 100
×100 m grid prior to the plots being sown for maize. Soil pH, organic matter (OM),
available P, K, Zn, and other nutrients were measured. The results showed that
OM, P, Zn and Fe were the main limiting factors in the soil. Spatial variability of
tested soil properties in the experimental village was observed. Great variation
was observed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B, and small spatial variation in soil K
resulting from the little fertilizer input. The spatial variability of soil OM and Ca
relied mainly on regional factors. The variability of soil nutrient was greatly
related to fertilization history, fertilizer application level, and soil texture. Sitespecific nutrient management (SSNM) based on regionalized balanced
fertilization helped to produce higher yield and income due to rational nutrient
supply to crop.

Soil nutrient management with information technology is an important part of

et al. 1999). Compared with developed countries, China is far behind in terms of
information technology use in soil nutrient management (Jin and Jiang 2000). The
small scale farmer's farmland and variability in their fertilization practices caused
the great variability in soil nutrient status. A fertilizer application survey
investigation in Shanxi province indicated that the percentage of time that N
application rate exceeded 250 kg N ha was 20 percent for wheat and 25 percent –1
for maize, and the percentage of time that N application rate less than 150 kg N ha –1
accounted for 56 percent for wheat and 53 percent for maize (Yang et al. 2008).
Continuous cropping without balanced and efficient use of fertilizers has
contributed to not only losses in yield and profit, but also to environmental
problems such as groundwater nitrate-N contamination and eutrophication of
rivers. Therefore, how to manage soil nutrient for the small scale operation with
informationtechnologyis of great challengein managingsoil nutrient.
In China, due to the small-scale farm size and the cost of soil testing, it is
impossible to give fertilizer recommend fertilizer based on each farmer. Usually,
the same amount of fertilizer is recommended for a 15- to 20 ha field irrespective
of the soil nutrient variability within the field. Thus, some areas of a field will
receive too much fertilizer, whereas other areas will receive too little. A better
understanding of the spatial variability of soil nutrients is required as a basis of soil
nutrient management and rational fertilizer application (Hammond 1994; Franzen
et al. 1996). Site-specific nutrient management in developed countries is based on
a large scale of farm size with a high level of mechanization. With the rapid
progresses of rural development and thereafter movement of farmers working in
the city, and the policy on stimulation of the farm land transition to the larger size,
fertilizer precision management based on soil nutrient variability would inevitably
make great progress.
In this study, a systematic analysis of soil nutrient variability in a maize
production area associated with the application of corresponding management
approach was carried out. The objectives were 1) to investigate spatial variation of
soil nutrient status and its distribution; 2) to develop nutrient management strategy
based on nutrient variation; and 3) to evaluate the effect of nutrient management
on yieldand profits.

Soil sampling and analysis


Atotal of 280 soil samples from 0-20 cm depth were collected on a 100×100 m grid
in the study areas of guided by using differential global positioning system
(DGPS) technology with a trimble 132 GPS receiver. All soil samples were airdried and ground through 2 mm sieve prior to analysis. The soil nutrients were
determined with procedures applied by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences (CAAS) and International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) Cooperative
Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory and the National Laboratory of Soil Testing
and Fertilizer Recommendation of CAAS as described by Portch and Hunter
(2002).Available P, K, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn of the soil samples were extracted using
0.25 M/LNaHCO�, 0.01 M/LEDTAand 0.01 M/LNH�F.The concentration of Pin 3 4
the extraction was measured by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method.
Concentration of K, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were determined using an atomic
absorption spectrophotometer. The organic matter (OM) of the soil samples was
extracted with an extracting solution containing 0.2 M/L NaOH, 0.01 M/L EDTA
and 2 percent methyl alcohol, and the concentration of OM in the extract was
determined by colormetry method. Soil pH was measured in a 2.5:1 soil-water
suspension using a glass pH electrode. Soil nitrate-N was extracted with a 2 M/L
KCl solution, and the concentration of nitrate-N in the extract was analyzed using
an ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 220 and 275 nm (Chen et al. 1995; Wang et al.
2004).


Data analysis


Descriptivestatisticsand geo-statisticswere used to analyzethe data.ANOVAwas
calculated using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The structure of spatial variation was
analyzed through semivariograms using GS+ for Windows 3.1. Spatial
distribution was analyzed through kriging interpolation using ArcGIS 8.0
software.

A semivariogram from the set of sample data is calculated using the
following equation(Chil s and Delfiner 1999):

Status of soil nutrients


Available nutrient contents of surface soil samples from the experimental village
were determined using the systematic approaches for soil nutrient evaluation
(Portch and Hunter, 2002). Table 1 showed that most of the soils were low in soil
OM, and deficient P, Zn and Fe, with the percentage of soil samples below the
critical value being 100, 86, 94 and 77, respectively. About 23percent of the soils
were relatively low in K, whereas soil S, Mn and Cu contents were above medium
evaluation levels, with average values of 44.6 mg l, 6.1 mg l and 1.4 mg l, -1 -1 -1
respectively. Soil Ca, Mg and B contents were much higher than the critical values.
Great variation existed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B content with C.V. of 47.5percent,
46.0percent,38.5percent,37.6percentand 42.0percent,respectively(Table 1).


Spatialvariationof soil nutrients


Semi-variograms analysis revealed a distinct different degree of spatial variability
of soil nutrients. Cambardella et al. (1994) reported that spatial variability for a
regionalized variable may be divided into three classes: strong, moderate and
weak spatial dependence, corresponding to a nugget to still ratio [c�/ (c�+c)] of 0 0
<25percent, 25-75percent and 75percent, respectively. About 20percent and
23percent of the spatial variability for OM and Ca were due to random factors
associated with human activities (such as fertilization, crop varieties, management
levels, etc), which demonstrated that spatial variability for soil OM and Ca was
mainly relied on regional factors (e.g. topography, climate and soil matrix). The

(Fig. 2). The contour map of soil properties may directly reflect the spatial
distribution characteristic of diversified soil nutrient element; also help to
understand the nutrient status to provide the foundation to rational fertilization.
The integrated map was conducted with overlaying the nutrient contour map and
farmer's plot map to understand soil nutrient status of each farmer's plot. If soil
nutrient contents in most areas of a farmer's plot were within one evaluation class,


**Fig.�2** Semivariograms�for�soil�pH,�OM,�P,�K�and�Zn�in�the�study�area



soil nutrient contents for all area of that farmer's plot were considered to fall within
one evaluation class. This made it possible to improve the fertilizer
recommendation system from one recommendation from 15-20 ha field to a sitespecificnutrientmanagementfor a specificfarmer's plot.
The distribution area with high P and K contents which was over the critical
level was located in the middle of the eastern part of the village, and that with
medium P and K nutrient level was distributed in the western part of the village.
The distribution area with lowest P and K contents was located at the south and

north bottom of the village. Soil Zn distribution map was similar to soil P (Fig. 3).
It was indicated that great spatial variation existed in soil nutrients, and spatial
distributionsimilaritywas observed in the soil P, K and Zn.


Yield and profit evaluationof SSNM


The site specific fertilizer recommendation (SSNM) significantly increased corn
yield and farmer's income compared to farmer's conventional practice. The
average yield of spring maize increased by 12.4percent and average farmer's
income increased by 798 Yuan/ha (117US$/ha) from SSNM fertilizer
recommendation compared to farmer's conventional practice in the experimental
site. These results showed that site-specific soil nutrient management based on
farmer's field unit can help to produce higher yield and income due to rational
nutrientsupply to crop.


**Discussion**


Previous and the current study indicated that great variation existed in soil nutrient
due to the small scale farm size production, different cropping system and
different fertilization custom (Yang et al; 2000; Huang et al., 2003, 2006). The
result obtained in the current study indicated that great variation for soil OM, P,
and Zn existed in the study area, and the survey of crop production history and
fertilizer application indicated that a close relationship existed between the spatial
variability of the soil nutrients and the crop production history and fertilizer
application rates. For example, the higher contents of soil P, K and Zn at mid
eastern of the village were resulted from the corresponding vegetable production
with heavy inorganic and organic nutrient input. The medium nutrient levels for P
and K were located at the western part, where was the maize production area with
certain nutrient input less than those from vegetable production area. The reasons
for lower contents of Pand K located at south and north bottom parts were the soils
with sandy loamtextureand relativelylow nutrientinputs from farmers.
The site-specific nutrient management practices have been carried out based
on the variation of soil nutrients. For the areas with great nutrient spatial variation,
the fertilizer recommendation would regionalize the study area with variable

fertilizer application rate; while for the areas with small nutrient spatial variation,
an uniformed fertilization rate would be recommended.Yang et al. (2000) reported
that the application of grid sampling and variable rate application technology in a
54-ha cotton field increased fertilizer efficiency, with a net profit of 5313 RMB
Yuan ha -1 (RMB Yuan 8.26 = US$ 1) higher than that obtained with local
fertilization practice. Huang et al. (2003) reported that the incorporation of
regionalized balanced fertilization technology into wheat and corn farming
practices significantly increased income by 590-1350 RMB Yuan ha . The results -1
obtained in this study demonstrated that maize yield increased by 12.4percent and
profit increased by RMBYuan 798 ha with the regionalized balanced fertilization -1
compared with that by farmer's practice. It was indicated that site specific nutrient
management practice based on nutrient spatial variation with regionalized
balancedfertilizationis a promising nutrientmanagementpracticein China.

**Conclusion**


The great variability in farmer's fertilization practices resulted in the great spatial
variation in soil nutrient status in the study area. The soil OM, P, Zn and Fe was
deficient in high percentage of nutrient values below the critical values. Large
variation in nutrient contents was observed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B. On the
contrary, soil K had a smaller spatial variability due to little nutrient input as
fertilizer. The variability of soil OM and Ca attributed mainly to random factors
and regional factors (e.g. topography, climate and soil matrix), and that for pH and
other nutrients related to more closely to random factors related to human
activities such as fertilization, cropping system, etc. The contour map of soil
properties may directly reflect the spatial distribution characteristic of diversified
soil nutrient, and help to understand the nutrient status to provide the foundation to
rational fertilization; Site-specific nutrient management integrated with
regionalized balanced fertilization based on farmer's field plot can help to produce
higher yieldand incomedue to rationalnutrientsupply to crop.

**Abstract** The soils of Orissa are broadly classified as Alfisols, Inceptisols,

Entisols andVertisols.Total potassium content in soils varies between 0.3 to 3.0%.
Non-exchangeable K constitute 21 to 61% of total K, whereas exchangeable K
12.5 to 35.7%. Production and productivity of major crops in the state are lower
than national average probably due to imbalance and lower fertilizer consumption
rate (62 kg ha ). Potassium application in the state was neglected up to 80's due to -1
lack of response and thereafter crop responses are increasing in time and space.
Low application of K leads to depletion of K to the extent of 242.8 thousand tones
per annum. In long-term fertilizer studies with rice-rice and rice-pulse cropping
systems, the sustainability of crop yield was threatened in absence of K
application. In many production systems in the state, the non-exchangeable K
meets the K requirement and sustains the level of production. Higher correlation
between HNO�-K and K balance and yield suggests the inclusion of this method in 3
soil testing programmes in the state. Optimal and super-optimal doses of K could
not sustain the yield and K depletion. Hence, a need to reschedule the K dose for
crops. An holistic management of K could be possible by applying adequate
amount of K on the basis of soil test, recycling of crop residues and addition of
rural and non-toxic urban compost in different cropping systems under varying
agro-ecological regions. A sustainable fertilizer management strategy should
ensure farm productivity, optimumeconomicreturn and soil health.

**Introduction**


The state of Orissa located in the Coromondal coast of India has a tropical
monsoon climate characterized by high humidity, high rainfall (1497 mm) and
short and medium winter. It is the 10 largest and 11 populous state accounting th th
about 5% of the geographical area and 4% of the population of the country. The

geographical area of the state is 15.57 m ha, out of which 6.2 m ha are arable land.
Agriculture contributes 28% to net state domestic production and employ 64% of
the work force.

Rice is the principal food grain of the state and occupies 50% of the total
cultivated area followed by pulses (22%), oilseeds (9%), vegetable (7%) and other
crops like fruits, spices, sugarcane, jute, etc. (12%). The production and
productivity of major crops in the state are below the Indian average. In addition to
soil acidity, low fertilizer consumption (57 kg ha ) and imbalanced use of fertilizer -1
are the reasons for low productivity. Although the state has experienced upward
trend in fertilizer use from 7.6 kg ha (1980) to 62 kg ha (2008 – 09), the ratio of N -1 -1
to K fertilizer is still wide, although narrowed down from 5.9 during 1980 to 4.43
during 2008–09.
During 1960 to 1990, India experienced a dramatic change in food grain
production with introduction of high yielding varieties and improved management
strategies. Later on, the yield level remains stagnant or declined even with increase
in level of input. Evidence of declining partial or total factor productivity is
already available. Depletion of soil K was one of the reason of yield decline in long �
term fertilizerexperiment(Ladha et al. 2003).
The experience with rice – rice cropping system which started during 1972 –
73 in lateritic (Aric haplaquepts) soil of Bhubaneswar showed lack of response to
K till 1983 and thereafter the response increased from 2.90 q ha to 8.95 q ha . In -1 -1
most of the cropping systems practiced in India, K balance is negative, however
the negative balance is not reflected in available K (Water soluble + Exchangeable
K) status over years of cropping.Ahuge negative balance of 242.8 thousand tones
per year in Orissa (Mishra and Mitra 2001) and proposed deficit of 8.1 million
tones per year by 2020 (Katyal 2001) in Indian agriculture is a matter of concern.
We have attempted to discuss K dynamics and management practices for major
cropping systems of Orissa under diverse agro-ecologicalsituations.

**Soils of Orissa**



0 / 0 /



The state of Orissa is situated between 17 47 and 22�33 N latitude and between
81�21' and 87�30 E longitude. Based on physiography and relief, the state is 0 / 0 /
broadly classified into 4 broad physical divisions, namely Northern plateau,
Central tableland, Eastern Ghats and Coastal plains. The soils of Orissa come
under 4 orders namely Inceptisols (7.49 m ha),Alfisols (5.62 m ha), Entisols (1.53
m ha) andVertisols (0.93 m ha). Inceptisols occupy 48% of total geographical area
(TGA), represent older alluvial and mixed red and yellow soils. These soils have
weak profile development and are at the beginning stage of soil formation.Alfisols
(36% of TGA) represent red, laterite and lateritic and brown forest soils. These
soils are base rich mineral soil and characterized by light coloured surface horizon
over a clay enriched argillic subsurface horizon. They are rich in Fe,Al oxides and



more strongly weathered that Inceptisols. Entisols (10% TGA) represent alluvial,
coastal saline and colluvial soil. These soils are recently formed soil with little
development of pedogenic horizons and are seen in flood plains in delta areas.
Vertisols (6% TGA) are black or regur and occurs in specific locations of the state.
These soils are black or dark coloured, uniform with gilgai micro relief. The clay
content is more than 30% and clay minerals are mostly smectitic.These soils swell
on wetting and shrink on drying with cracks of more than 1 cm wide and have
angular blocky structure. About 70-75% of soils of Orissa are acidic and support
important production systems including cereals, pulses, oilseeds, horticultural
crops, plantation crops and forestry. The production and productivity of crops in
Orissa are low (Table 1) as compared to all India average due to both deficiency
and toxicity of plant nutrients, low consumption of fertilizer and imbalanced use
of fertilizer(Table 2).

**Mineralogy�of�soils**


Important K bearing minerals in soils of Orissa are muscovite, biotite and feldspar.
Release of K to crops depends on the nature of dominating K bearing mineral. On

the basis of K release power, the minerals are arranged in the order of: biotite >
muscovite > orthoclase > microcline. The inherent status of K in soils of Orissa is

mainly governed by the soil mineralogy. The microcline is the most common Kfeldspar in the soils of Orissa (Sahu et al. 1995). InAlfisols, orthoclase constituted
9.8 to 41.1% while muscovite mica from nil to 6.1% (Table 3). The presence of
high content of light minerals (orthoclase feldspar) in fine sand fractions may be
attributed to moderate weathering in the environment. High temperature with
alternate wet and dry season in humid sub-tropical climate of Orissa are also
conducive for development of illite in the clay fractions due to alternation and
partial hydrolysis of feldspar and mica (Sahu et al. 1983). The occurrence of
Kaolinite in these soils is also expected due to leaching of bases. In the Inceptisols,

orthoclase content varies 7 to 42.4 %. Except Shyamakhunta and Motto (saline
soil), mica content varies between 1.0 to 4.8 %. These soils in general are, neutral
to slightly alkaline and have high base saturation capacity with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+
dominating in the exchange complex. These conditions are favorable for the
formation of smectites in the clay fractions (Sahu et al. 1983). Alternation of Kfeldspar might have led to the formation of illite in clays. The Entisols are found in
Delta area of Orissa due to deposition of silt and clay by the action of flood and
contained higher amount of orthoclase (27.1 to 38.6%) and mica (1.7 to 17.4 %).
High mica content in the sand fraction indicates lack of weathering and the soils
are rich in K. High base saturation with mild acidic to neutral soil reaction must
have favoured formationof smectitesbesides illites(Sahu et al. 1990)
The orthoclase and mica inVertisols of Orissa varies between 12.4 and 26.9 %

and between 2.7 and 11.0 %, respectively. Their transformation/alteration
accounts for the occurrence of illite. Abundance of Ca and Mg 2+ 2+ in an alkaline
environment favours the formation of montmorilonite in the clay fraction. Nayak
et al. (2001) analysed the fine sand fraction (0.1 to 0.25 mm) of Alfisols and
Inceptisols of university farm (OUAT) at Bhubaneswar and reported that quartz
dominated (55.0 - 80.5 % ) the fine sand fraction along with K bearing minerals
like orthoclase feldspar (9.5 -31.0 %), biotite and muscovite mica (0.5 -2%). The
Alfisols contained more K bearing minerals than the Inceptisols (Table 4). In fine
sand fraction (0.1 -0.25 mm) of soils of Kanchinala micro watershed under coastal
plains of Mahanadi delta of Orissa. Mishra (2008) observed a considerable
amount of K bearing minerals like orthoclase, muscovite and biotite in upland,
medium land and low land soils (Table 5). Higher amount of orthoclase was
present in low land (20.6%) followed by medium land (19.2%) and upland

(16.5%). On the other hand the content of muscovite and biotite was in the order of
upland > mediumland > lowland.
Weathering process is generally influenced by cationic environment,
especially the base saturation of clays. An alkaline environment favours the
formation of montmorillonite while acidic environment favours the formation of

kaolinite and Mg rich environment produces vermiculite. Release of organic acids
through decay of plant roots by microbes accelerates the process of weathering. In
laterite soils under rice-rice cropping system (Pattanayak 1992) the allophane
content was increased from 0.04 (initial value) to 0.048 in control, and 066 in
150% NPK treatment. Lower content of allophane (0.012) was observed in fallow
treatment. Intensive cultivation of rice-rice cropping system for 18 years with
100% NPK increased the illite content. The content of interstratified smectite was

higher in 100% NPK + FYM and illite with interstratified smectite in 150 % NPK
treatment(Table 6).

**Potassium�status**


Soils of Orissa are considered as medium to high in available potassium. Coastal



-1



saline soils are high in exchangeable-K (56.6 to 624 mg kg ) and water soluble-K
(117 to 624 mg kg ). Alluvial soils have wide rage of K status. The extreme low -1
values of exchangeable-K and percent K saturation in alluvial and red soils
indicated the higher K removal from non-exchangeable sites under high cropping
intensity. The total K�O content ranges from 0.30 to 1.20 % in laterite soils, 1.62 to 2
6.03 % in mixed red and black soils, 0.68 to 2.41% in alluvial soils, and 1.77 to
3.01% in coastal saline soils. Non-exchangeable K constitutes 21 to 64% of total
K, highest being in alluvial soils where as the exchangeable K constitutes between
12.5 to 35.7 % of total K. In rice-groundnut growing soils of Alhagarh in Cuttack
district (Pal et al. 2001) total K ranged from 950 to 2400 mg kg . Ammonium -1
acetate extractable K constitutes 3 to 12%, non-exchangeable K 14 to 45% and
lattice-K 48-80% of the total K. Total K content in surface soils of an watershed in

Khajuripada block of Kandhamal district with rice-pulse cropping system varied
between 1100 to 2600 mg kg (Das et al. 1997). Total K content increased with -1
decrease in elevation of the watershed. In all the three profiles (foot hill, mid
upland and medium valley), water soluble K decreased whereas nonexchangeable, lattice K and total K increased with depth, probably due to increase
in clay content. Lattice K constitutes 53 to 73 %, non-exchangeable and
exchangeableK from 24.8 to 41.8 and 2.8 to 3.7 % of totalK, respectively.

**Interrelationship�of�forms�of�K**


Exchangeable, non-exchangeable, lattice and total K of 21 alluvial soil samples
collected from rice-groundnut cropping system (Pal et al. 2001) and rice-pulse
cropping system (Sahu 1994) in Badamba block of Cuttack district were
positively correlated with each otherThe dynamic equilibrium was existed among
different pools and depletion of K from one pool is replenished from the other
pools of soil K.


**Potassium�transformation**


The rate at which K is released from non-exchangeable sources is an index of the
ability of soil to supply K to crops. The rate and magnitude of release depend on
the level of K in soil solution and amount and type of clay minerals present in soil
(Martin and Spark 1985).The contribution of release of non-exchangeable K to Kavailability has been reported by several workers (Sparks 2000, Parker et al. 1989
b). The rate of release of non-exchangeable K is influenced by the degree of
exposure of edges of clay minerals to the soil solution. In some soils the release of
non-exchangeable K may be slow and restrict crop yield, where as in some cases it
may be rapid to meet the K requirement of crops. The release kinetics of eight soil
series in Indo-Gangetic plain of India (Sekhon et al.1992) showed that Kaolinite
dominated alluvial soils and smectitic acidic alluvial soils in lower Gangetic plain



422 423


showed lower rate of K release from the non-exchangeable fraction than that of
illiticalluvialsoils.

In rice-rice cropping system in Inceptisols and soyabean-wheat-cowpea in
Vertisols (Typic Haplusterts), the total K uptake by crops exceeded the amount of
K applied. The plots which did not receive K fertilizer (control, N and NP
treatment) in soybean-wheat-cowpea system contributed K to the extent of 3129
to 9932 kg ha from non-exchangeable source as against 1183 to 1891 kg ha in -1 -1
rice-rice system. The results of LTFE trials clearly showed that mining of K
occurred with N, NPand even with NPK application(Rupa et al. 2003)
Results from two long term fertilizer experiments conducted at Bhubaneswar
with rice-rice cropping system and at Keonjhar with rice-oilseed/pulse cropping
system representing two different agro-climatic regions of Orissa showed that in
rice-rice cropping system there was sharp increase in available K in the first 10
years of cropping followed by a rapid fall between 1980-1983 and almost
plateauing afterwards in all treatments except NPK+FYM treatment (Fig. 1). The
treatment that received 100% NP but no K always recorded lowest NH�OAC K 4
followed by 50% NPK treatment. On the other hand 150% NPK treatment
recorded highest value of NH�OAC K followed by 100 % NPK treatment. In 4
mixed red and black soil of Keonjhar with rice-mustard cropping system, the


                                                                                                
NH�OAC K in surface increased rapidly by nearly 100% than the initial (144 kg ha 4

1 ) probably due to bringing the uncultivated barren land under cultivation and

increase in organic matter content ( 0.23 to 0.55%). Subsequently there was a

There was a gradual decrease of HNO –K over the years and after 20 years it 3
reached almost 50% of the initial level particularly in the treatments that received
K every year (Fig. 3). Maximum decrease was recorded in NP followed by
NPK+FYM treatment. The decrease in latter treatment might be due to relatively
much higher cumulative uptake of K by crops associated with higher biomass
yield. The depletion of 1N HNO�-K could maintain large amount of potassium in 3
soil solution and exchange sites by reestablishing the equilibrium among different
forms of K. Multiple correlation studies revealed that, both NH�OAC and 1N 4
HNO extractable K in soil in various treatments of LTFE trials were significantly 3
correlated to the K balance indicating a strong influence of K application and
uptakeon the extractableK status of surface soil.

Dobermann and Fairhurst (2000) suggested K saturation as a better indicator
for K supply of soils. He categorized rice soils with less than 1.5% K saturation as
low K, with 1.5–2.5% K saturation as medium K and with more than 2.5% K
saturation as high K soils. The K saturation of broad soil groups of Orissa were in
the order of: black soils (5.54%) > coastal saline soils (4.32%) > laterite soils
(2.7%) > alluvial soils (2.35%).Although K saturation of Orissa soils come under
high category, still good response to K application was recorded in alluvial and
laterite soils where as there was no response in coastal saline soils. However,
optimum dose of K for crops in coastal saline soils is recommended to suppress Na
uptake.

rice- rice system at Bhubaneswar due to decrease in total K in all the three layers

Subsurface K contributes significantly to plant nutrition. The difference in
mineralogy and K reserve in subsurface horizon influences the subsurface K
availability. Results of 15 years of rice-rice cropping at Bhubaneswar revealed that
although NH�OAC –K of the surface layer was higher than the initial value, the sub 4
surface layers showed a lower status as compared to initial value. On the other
hand, there was substantial decrease in 1N HNO�-K in all the layers indicating the 3
contribution of non exchangeable K towards K nutrition of crops. Similar findings
were also observed with respect to NH�OAc–K and HNO –K at Keonjhar after 10 4 3
years of cropping.
These results indicated that at Bhubaneswar NH�OAc–K in different layers 4
showed very poor correlation with K balance. On the contrary significant
correlation existed between HNO –K of each layer and K balance (r=0.85**, 3
0.72** and 0.74** for 0-0.15, 0.15-0.30 and 0.30-0.45m layer), respectively.
Around 68% of the variation of HNO –K of 0-0.15 m layer were accounted for K 3
balance. A measure of total K in all the three layers also shows a substantial
variation from the initial value. A drop in total K at the end of 1987-88 was many
times higher than the decrease in NH�OAc–K and HNO –K indicating that 4 3
weatherable K bearing minerals in surface and sub surface layers make a major
contribution to plant uptake K. Singh et al. (2002 b) reported that application of
organic manures along with urea –N increased the cumulative non – exchangeable
K release and could maintain large amount of K in soil solution on exchange sites
by reestablishing the equilibrium among different forms of K. In rice-rice
cropping system at Bhubaneswar, NPK + FYM treatment encourage release of
more non – exchangeable K under acidic environment to meet crop requirement
of K.Wihandjaka et al. (1999) observed that mobilization of non-exchangeable K
in flooded rice is due to root induced acidification and removal of K from soil

solution by roots. Under flooded rice ecosystem, release of hydronium ion (H�O ) 3
from roots and decomposition of organic manures and plant residue, actively



Step K provides estimation of K availability from the non–exchangeable sources
and constant rate K (CR-K) is a measure of difficulty available K of mineral lattice
source. The K release characteristics of 21 surface soil samples of laterite soils
with rice based cropping system revealed that step K was maximum in the 1 st
extraction and varied from 150 to 700 mg kg and gradually decreased to zero in 6 -1 th
and 7 extraction (Pal et al. 2001). Higher values of step K is associated with th
greater release of K from non–exchangeable K under stress condition. The CR- K,
total step K and total exchangeable K in soils varies between 12-56, 140-1332 and
500-1592 mg kg . The correlation coefficient of K release parameter with -1
different forms of K showed that exchangeable, non–exchangeable, lattice and
total K were positively correlated with each other suggesting the existence of
dynamic equilibrium among the different pools of K in soil. Highly significant and
positive correlation between step K with HNO K indicates that HNO K could 3 3
serve as a good index of plant available non–exchangeable K in soil. In alluvial
soils with rice based cropping system, the step K was maximum in the 1 st
extraction and varied between 104 and 1510 mg kg -1 and gradually decreased with
increase in number of extraction (Sahu 1994). Constant rate K (CR K) values
varied from 8 to 44 mg kg, which indicate adequate supply of lattice K to plants. -1
The total extractable K varied from 442 to 1792 mg kg soil. In a long term -1
fertilizer experiment (LTFE) with rice-rice cropping system sequential stepwise
extraction with boiling HNO 3 yielded two categories of K viz. CR K, released
from mineral lattice at a fairly constant rate and step K released from edge and
wedge zone of micaceous minerals, the amount of which was negligible after 3 rd
extraction (Senapati 1993). There was little difference of CR K in different
treatments(Table 7).
There was a quite large difference in step-K. The NPK treatments recorded
much higher step K values compared to NP treatments in all the three layers of
soil indicating their potentiality to release K for crop uptake. As compared to the
initial level, Step K declined by 55% in NP treatment in 0-15 cm layer. When both
surface and subsurface layers are taken into account, the decrease in Step K was
45% in NP treatment, 4% in 150% NPK and 19% in 100% NPK treatment. The
decreasein 100% NPK +FYM was slightlymore (27%) due to higher crop uptake.

In acidic Inceptisols of Bhubaneswar, complete exclusion of K resulted in 74

years revealed that continuous cultivation of rice without fertilizer (N�P�K�) 0 0 0
decreased grain yield by 52 % over initial year yield (9.7 q ha ) where as in N and -1
NP treatments the grain yield was declined by 50 and 37%, respectively over the
initial year yield (Fig. 4). With application of balanced NPK, the yield decline was
narrowed down to 25%. Combined application of NPK+FYM and super optimal
dose of NPK (150%) increased the grain yield by 21 and 10%, respectively over
the initial year yield. With passage of time, the yield gap between control (N�P�K�) 0 0 0
and NPK+FYM treatment increased from 9 q ha (initial year) to 25 q ha over 41 -1 -1
cropping cycles. The decline trend was more prominent after 1983 onwards
probably due to K and other micronutrientsas limitingfactors.

Benefit of use of Potassium on pulse was observed in the K deficient Balisahi
series of Khurda district of Orissa (Mitra et al. 1993). Application of 40 kg K, 20
kg N and 40 kg P ha to summer groundnut in laterite soils of Bhubaneswar -1
significantly increased yield from 10.60 to 15.88 q ha . Significantly higher yield -1
(22.7 q ha ) of rabi groundnut over NP control (16.4 q ha ) with the application of -1 -1
60 kg K ha has also been reported. Results of farmer's field trials in alluvial soils -1
of Siula (Puri district of Orissa) revealed that there was significant increase in
green gram yield by 67% with application of 20 kg K ha even without application -1
of any N fertilizer(Mitra and Sahoo 1998).
Among the fruit crops, banana responded significantly to K application. At
yield level of 58 t ha, banana removes 1180 kg K ha . Experimental results of -1 -1
OUAT revealed fruit yield, fruit weight, total soluble solids, total sugar and
ascorbic acid content of banana increased with increasing level of K in alluvial
soils of Puri district(Table 9).

The response of turmeric and ginger to K application is well documented.The
data revealed that turmeric responded up to 90 kg K ha and 26 % higher yield over -1
K control (8.14 t ha ) was recorded. Similarly, the yield of ginger at 50 and 100 kg -1
K ha increased by 6 and 12% over control respectively. There was no response to -1
higher dose of K.
Jena et al. (2006) reported that average response of rice to K application was
of the magnitude of 7.8 kg per kg K�O for mixed red and black, 4.8 to 6.4 kg for red 2
and lateritic and 4.4 to 4.8 kg per kg of K�O for mixed red and yellow soils where 2
as there was no response to K application in coastal saline and brown forest soils.
The average response of pulses (black gram and green gram) was of the order of
2.7 kg for brown forest soil and 4.4 kg for black soil per kg of K�O applied. The 2
variation in response in different soil groups could be attributed to difference in
textureand mineralogyof soils.

for rice need to be revised from 30 to 60 kg ha since 62% of K depletion is caused -1

**Potassium removal and balances in different cropping systems**



In rice-rice cropping system over 41 cropping cycles in laterite soil of
Bhubaneswar, the K uptake under optimum fertilizer application (100% NPK)
was 137 kg ha which was increased to 167 kg ha with integrated use of 100% -1 -1
NPK + FYM.The mean annual K balance was negative in all the treatments (Table
10). Green manuring or incorporation of paddy straw reduces K mining in ricerice cropping system (Pal and Dash 2009). The K removal by rice – groundnut
cropping system in alluvial soils was 180 kg ha where as in rice – green gram -1
cropping system in laterite soils it was 170 kg ha (Jena 2008). In general, cereals, -1
pulses and oil seed crops removes 226, 67 and 83 kg K ha, respectively (Panda -1
1995). K removal in vegetables and fruit crops was much higher than cereals,
pulses and oilseeds (Senapati and Santra 2009). The K removal by vegetables

The depletion of K to the extent of 51.0 and 37.0 kg ha was recorded in rice –
green gram and rice-groundnut cropping system, respectively at optimum level of
K application (Jena 2008). However, at super-optimal level (150% NPK) the K
depletion was decreased to 41.0 and 26.0 kg ha in rice – green gram and rice- -1
groundnut cropping system, respectively(Fig. 5, 6).

**Management of potassium**



Soil type, mineralogy, K fixation, amount and leaching loss of K should be
considered while fixing the dose of K for different crops. Potassium fixation
studies have revealed that soils become more hungry for K fixation with the
continuation of negative balance. Illite soils fixed 23-29% of applied K, kaolinite
and smectite soils 17-23% and 26-32%, respectively (Srinivas-Rao et al. 2000).
Maintenance of shallow surface submergence in rice-rice cropping system in soils
containing 2:1 clay minerals may increase K fixation and reduce solution K, thus
increasingthe rice dependenceon non-exchangeablereserve for K uptake.
Leaching losses of K is a major concern under frequent intense rainfall
conditions in well drained soils of humid tropics. Leaching tends to be a problem
in soils with low CEC. The leaching losses of K in loam and sandy loam profiles
under submerged moisture regime were 22 and 16% of applied K, respectively
(Singh et al. 2004). Therefore, either K application level should be increased by
25-50% or the rice residues, which contain huge quantity of K (88-92% of total
uptake), be recycled in the soil. Even burning of rice straw in field is a better option
than its removal (Prasad 2007). Split application of K in the ratio of 1:1 at peak
tillering and PI stage is recommended to rice to reduce the chaff percent and
increasetest weight.

for groundnut in most of the soils of Orissa.Application of 40 kg K�O ha with NP 2
to summer groundnut grown on the lateritic soils of Bhubaneswar significantly
increased yield from 10.60 q ha -1 to 15.88 q ha . Benefits of use of potassic -1
fertilizers on pulses were also observed in the K deficient Balisahi series. Green

gram yield was significantly increases due to application of 30 kg K�O ha . The 2
recommended application (100% NPK) to rice – pulse and rice – oilseeds
cropping system recorded highest yield and benefit:cost ratio. There was
significant response to super optimal dose (150%) of NPK in alluvial and laterite
soils having medium to high organic carbon status. Basal application of K @ 40 kg
ha at sowing is recommended for pulse crops in Orissa. Split application of K in -1
the ratio of 1:1:1 at planting, 30 and 60 days after planting is recommended for
vegetable crops like cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, tomato and spices like chilli.
Basal application of 30 kg K ha for mustard and 60 kg K ha for sunflower is -1 -1
recommended for higher yield and oil content. Integrated application of K with N,



Pand FYM improve the nutrient use efficiency and yield and hence recommended
for higher profit.


**Conclusion**


The mining of K will limit crop yield and it may not be possible to maintain the
present production. Results of long term fertilizer trials with rice-rice and ricepulse cropping systems indicated that gradually the magnitude of response to
applied K increased as K becomes limiting factor.Application of FYM, recycling
of crop residues and green manuring can help to improve K balance in different
cropping systems. Significant correlation of HNO�-K with K balance and yield 3
suggest its inclusion in soil testing laboratories. K balance in different cropping
systems, based on precise data on K removal, K inputs from irrigation water or rain
water, straw recycling besides fertilizers and manures needs to be worked out.
Straw management can strongly influence K budget and can help in efficient
management of K for a sustainable cropping systems in different regions. A
sustainable fertilizer management strategy must ensure the farm productivity,
optimumeconomicreturn without deteriorationof agriculturalenvironment.

## **Quantifying uptake rate of potassium from soil in a** **long-term grassrotationexperiment**


**IÖborn ACEdwards SHillier** � �



**Abstract** Soil-plant potassium (K) dynamics were studied using a long-term field

experiment in order to evaluate the plant performance and K delivering capacity of
the soil parent material. Rye grass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) based rotations on a loamy
sand derived from granitic bedrock were studied over 30 years with two Kfertilisation regimes, nil (K0) and 65 kg K ha yr . Mineralogical and chemical -1 -1
methods were combined to identify and quantify soil K resources including the
partitioning of K between minerals. Two or three cuts were taken annually and
herbage yield and composition together with exchangeable soil K were analysed.
Herbage yield declined with time and significantly reduced when the K
concentrations approached 1%. The grass K concentration also declined over time
and stabilized at around 0.5-0.7% (dw) in K0 in all cuts. Input-output mass
balances showed an accumulated net K off-take (deficit) of 1100 kg ha, i.e. 35 kg -1
ha yr . With an exchangeable K pool of 100 kg ha (in the rooting zone 0-40 cm) -1 -1 -1
this indicated a substantial release of K from mineral sources, most probably
biotite and hydrobiotite. Assuming a similar net off-take was continued then this
particular mineralogical K source would be depleted within two centuries. The
study illustrates the strength of combining long-term field experimental data with
state of the art quantitative mineralogical methods in order to assess site-specific
resources which can form a basis to evaluate the sustainability of different
managementpractices.

**Introduction**


Nutrient imbalances are a common feature of many agricultural systems, with
both annual surpluses and deficiencies being reported (e.g. Smaling et al. 1999;
Askegaard et al. 2004). While much emphasis has been given to quantifying
nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances at geographical scales ranging from
field to nation, similar calculations are not generally reported for potassium (K).
One notable exception is Foy et al. (2002). A lack of any obvious environmental
concerns associated with a K surplus is probably the main factor responsible for
this omission. This general situation is changing due to factors such as the
increased price of agricultural inputs including K fertilisers. Evidence for a
decline in soil K status has been provided through the regular monitoring of
agricultural soils in England and Wales (Goulding and Loveland 1986; Skinner
andTodd 1998) where both regional and temporal trends in soil extractable K were
described for the previous 25 years. There was some indication for a wider decline
in K status, particularly evident for grassland, with 20% of all fields sampled in the
Northern region having a low K status (index 0). Declining rates of K fertiliser
coupled with manure applications determined on the basis of their N content has
resulted in a wide ranging annual K balance within cropping systems of NW
Europe (e.g. Askegaard and Eriksen 2002; Alfaro et al. 2003; Berry et al. 2003;
Kayser and Isselstein 2005; Öborn et al. 2005a, b). Also in other geographical
regions negative K balances in agricultural production systems have been reported
urging for intensified research efforts on K management and dynamics in different
soil types, climatic regions and cropping systems (e.g. Bedrossian and Singh
2004; Bell et al 2009). Greatly increased crop yields and nutrient off-take in
harvested products have exacerbated this situation. Losses of K can also be
associated with home produced forage crops and recycling of manure/urine (e.g.
Öborn et al. 2005b; Gustafson et al. 2007), and/or where excessive leaching occurs
from coarse textured soils (e.g. Wulff et al. 1998; Askegaard and Eriksen 2008).
Within systems managed organically negative K field balances have also been
reported (e.g. Watson et al. 2002; Askegaard et al. 2003; Bengtsson et al. 2003),
and there is a growing concern about net off-take of K and how to sustain the soil
fertility, harvest level and crop quality (e.g. Fortune et al. 2005). Export of
nutrients accompanies the sale of all agricultural produce and inherent sitespecific soil properties such as mineralogy and texture coupled with climatic
factors and farming system determine the likely long-term significance of any
potential K deficiency (e.g. Heming 2004;Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007; Simonsson
et al. 2007; Barré et al. 2008; 2009).
The significant contribution that soil minerals can make to plant available K
means that this aspect should also be considered in addition to fertiliser and
manure inputs. While lack of total soil K (Tot-K) reserves (organic soils being an
exception) is not often an issue, it is possible that short-term deficits of plant



available K, for example, during the later part of the pasture growing season may
occur (e.g. Brady and Weil 1996). During these times the rates of exchange
between various soil K sources need to be considered. Various soil K pools have
been defined as, soil solution K, exchangeable K, fixed or non-exchangeable K
bound in the inter-layer positions, e.g. of weathered micas, vermiculites etc., and
finally structural K particularly associated with micas and K-feldspars (e.g.
Sparks and Huang 1985; Sparks 1987; Huang 1989; Robert 1992). The dynamic
situation that exists between the K pools determines the plant available K and is
among other things influenced by plant properties such as root density and rooting
depth (e.g. Haak 1981; Kuhlmann 1990; Witter and Johansson 2001), climatic
conditions (soil temperature and moisture) (e.g. Holmqvist et al. 2003), soil
attributes (organic acids, pH, particle size distribution etc) as well as type of K
bearing minerals (e.g.Wilson 1992; 2004; Hinsinger and Jaillard 1993; Barré et al.
2007; 2008) and management practices (e.g. Singh and Goulding 1997;
Simonsson et al. 2007).
This paper describes the long-term soil-plant K dynamics for a grass ( _Lolium_

_perenne_ L.) based rotation growing on a loamy sand soil derived from granitic

bedrock. Treatments without or with annual fertiliser K additions are compared
over a 30 year period and the system sustainability including the plant
performance and K delivering capacity of the soil parent material are considered.
It was hypothesised that K-bearing soil minerals could supply sufficient K to
maintaingrass herbage production in low input systems.


The specificobjectiveswere to:
i) Assess the annual and within year performance of herbage biomass
production and K concentrationof ryegrass herbage;
ii) Establish annual and long-term K input-output mass balances in order to
identifymajorsources and sinks and assess temporaltrends;
iii) Study trends in plantavailable(aceticacidextractable)K, and
iv) Quantify individual chemical and mineralogical soil K pools in order to
determinetheir potentialcontributionsto long-termplant availableK.


**Materialsand Methods**


Site and soil description



The experimental site was located on Macaulay Institute grounds at
Craigiebuckler (57 8'N, 2 9'W), Aberdeen, NE Scotland. The mean annual o o
average temperature and rainfall were 7.9 o C and 791 mm, respectively (1961-80;
Dyce airport 57 12'N, 2 12'W) (Broad and Hough 1993). Precipitation was o o
measured on the experimental site 1968-95 and the monthly averages were used
when evaluating the uptake rates. The average growing season (6 C) in the area o

was 215 days (s.d. 14 days) lasting from 8 April to 10 November (Broad and
Hough 1993).
The soil was classified as Dystric Cambisol (FAO) or Typic Fragiorthod (Soil
Taxonomy) (Adamo et al. 1998). According to Scottish terminology it is a freely
draining iron humus podsol developed in glacial till derived from granitic bedrock
and it belongs to the Countesswells Association and Dess Series (Glentworth and
Muir 1963). Soil and profile characteristics of the experimental site are given in
Table 1.


Experimentaldesign



The field experiment was established in 1968 and had a randomised block design
with two K treatments, K65 which received 65 kg K ha yr (as KCl) and K0 which -1 -1
received no K, and five replicates.Three experimental phases could be defined; an
initial 12 year period of grass (Grass I, two cuts per year) followed by 6 years with
cereals (Cereal), and a final 11 years of grass (Grass II, three cuts per year). The
timing of the cuts, i.e. the growth stage of the grass, was set to mimic the hay/silage
cuts by farmers. During the two grass periods the K65 plots received fertiliser
annually during the spring. All plots also received a basal N (50 kg N ha yr ) -1 -1
dressing as nitrochalk at the start of the growing season and after each cut, i.e. in
total 100 kg N ha yr for Grass I and 150 kg N ha yr for Grass II. During the six- -1 -1 -1 -1
year cereal period a similar annual basal N, P and K dressing was applied to all
plots (75-85 kg N, 19-21 kg P and 63-74 kg K). The cropping sequence therefore
consisted of perennial ryegrass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) established in 1969 (Grass I)
and 1987/88 (Grass II) with the cereal phase consisting of four years of spring
barley ( _Hordeum vulgare,_ L.), one year of oats ( _Avena sativa_ L.), and one year of
winter wheat ( _Triticum aestivum,_ L.).

Samplingand sample treatment


Responsibility for sample collection and analysis changed over the 30 year
experimental period, however, protocols were all well documented and analytical
dataconsistentlyrecorded.


_Plantsampling and preparation_



Total herbage biomass yield was recorded at each cut, and a sub-sample taken for
dry matter determination and chemical analyses. All remaining herbage was
removed from the field to simulate a hay/silage situation. Prior to digestion and
chemical analyses herbage samples were dried at 60 C and milled. For cereals, the o
grain weight was recorded and sub-samples taken and prepared for analysis. Both

the cereal grain and the straw were removed from the field, and in 1987 straw was
sampled and analysed. For budget calculations the straw weight was estimated
using a grain:straw ratio of 1:1 (Hanson 1990). In two years, 1981 (grass) and 1985
(barley), the plots were cut and cleared but no yield recorded, on these occasions
the average K removal from grass 1978-80, and barley 1982 and 84, were used in
budget calculationsas estimatesfor 1981 (grass) and 1985 (barley), respectively.


_Soil sampling and sample preparation_


Surface soil (0-15 cm) was collected annually in the autumn (after the last herbage
cut) 1968 to 1987 when approximately 10 sub-samples were taken from each plot
with a screw auger. InApril 1998 (before the fertilisation), soil samples were taken
from three surface horizons, 0-5 cm (Ap1), 5-15 (Ap2) and 15-25 cm (Ap3), and
one subsurface horizon within the rooting depth (B, 25-40 cm). When possible
(only in 5 plots because it was very stony), the BC-horizon (40-60 cm) was
sampled.Within each plot 20, 10, 10 and 5 sub-samples were taken from 0-5 cm, 515, 15-25 cm, and 25-40 cm depths respectively.Acore sampler was used for the 025 cm samples and a screw auger for the 25-60 cm depth. The C-horizon (60-80
cm) was also sampled in three soil pits located immediately adjacent to the
experimental plots. In total 0.5-1 kg soil per plot and horizon was taken. The soil
was sieved fresh at 2 mm and air-dried at 30 C prior to the analyses. The o
mineralogical analyses were carried out on pooled composite samples from the
different horizons.


_Soil bulk density_


The bulk density for each soil horizon was determined in the three soil pits
(0.5*0.5*0.5 m). All soil from each horizon was removed, and the volume of the
removed horizon was carefully measured in the soil pit. The soil was air dried,
sieved and the <2mm fraction weighed and its bulk density calculated for each
horizon. The average values from the three profiles (Table 1) were used in the
calculationand expression of soil K dataon an aerialbasis.


Plant and soil analyses


_Plantanalyses_


The crop samples were wet-digested and K was analysed by flame photometry
(1969-88) or ICP-AES (1989-1998). The straw K concentration measured in 1987
in the K0 and K65 treatments, respectively, were used as general estimates for the
straw K concentration in the two treatments. The weighted annual average K
concentrations were calculated for the grass cuts and used in graphs and budget



calculations.


_Soil analyses_



Acetic acid extractable-K (Ac-K) was determined annually on soil collected from
individual plots between 1969 and 1987, and then in 1990, 1991 and in 1998.Airdried soil (2.5 g) was extracted by 100 ml 2.5% acetic acid (MISR/SAC 1985) and
K was analysed by flame photometry (1969-88) or ICP-AES (1988-1998). In
addition, a subset of samples (n=10) were extracted with 1 M ammonium acetate
(NH�Ac pH 7) (Rowell 1994) and analysed by ICP-AES in order to relate theAc-K 4
extraction to an internationally frequently used extraction for exchangeable K.
Acetic acid (2.5%) extracted on average 94% of 1 M NH�Ac andAc-K will in this 4
paper be used as a proxy for exchangeable K. Aqua-regia K (Aq-K) was extracted
by 3:1 50% HCl:conc. HNO (by volume) (McGrath and Cunliffe 1985; McGrath 3
1987) and analysed by ICP-AES. Total-K (Tot-K) was determined by X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) using a Philips PW 1404 spectrometer and the methods by
Norrish and Hutton (1969) for sample fusion and corrections for interelement
effects.

For determination of the mineralogical composition 3 g soil (<2 mm) was
ground in an agate McCrone mill for 12 min with 9 g of liquid (0.5% polyvinyl
alcohol and 2 drops of octanol) and spray dried as per Hillier (1999). X-ray powder
diffraction (XRPD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5000 instrument from

2-75°2θ using Cobalt Kα radiation, in 0.02° steps counting for 2 seconds per step.
The resulting XRPD patterns were quantified by full-pattern fitting as described in
detail by Omotoso et al. (2006, participant 18). Uncertainty at 95% confidence is

given by X 0.35, where X is concentration in weight percent (Hillier 2003).
Mineralogical analyses were carried out on composite samples from the
experimental plots. The partitioning of K amongst the identified mineral phases
was estimated using assumed chemical compositions (Table 2) (Andrist-Rangel et
al. 2006;Andrist-Rangel 2008).

Highest yields, >10 tonnes dw ha (t ha ) occurred during the first few years of
Grass I, with both treatments displaying a trend of declining production. Yields
remained comparable between treatments for the first five years after
establishment. The yield for K0 continued to decline until an apparent plateau at
about 6 t ha -1 was reached, and from the seventh year the K65 plots had a
significantly higher production (Fig. 1a). After the break years with cereals no
significant differences in biomass harvest for the first two years of Grass II were
apparent, but from the third year until the end of the period the K65 plots showed a
significantly higher yield (Fig. 1a). The accumulated herbage yield over the two



Dep was estimated from an average rain water concentration of 5 g L K �
measured by Reid et al. (1981) and the mean annual precipitation for 1961-80.The
run-off was calculated from mean monthly data on precipitation and
evapotranspiration (1961-80). Soil water K concentrations were obtained from an
adjacent field experiment, and Leach estimated from mean monthly run-off data K

and soil-water K concentrations.

The K 'uptake rate' (kg K ha d ) was roughly estimated by dividing the grass K
removal by each cut by the days between the cuts. For cut 1, the days from 1April
to the harvest time was used as estimate for the growth period. For cut 2 and cut 3
the days elapsed between the grass cuts was used.
The root length density (cm cm ) from an established grass sward on an -3
adjacent field with the same soil type was used to estimate the K uptake from
different soil depths (Edwards et al. 1987). Edwards et al. (1987) determined the
root length density using soil cores subdivided into the depths; 0-5, 5-15, 1525(/30) cm (subsoil boundary) and subsoil (30-45 cm). The root length density
was highest in the upper 0-5 cm where it was 25-30 cm cm . The main part of the -3
roots, 42%, were found in the upper 0-5 cm, 21% in each of the 5-15 and 15-25 cm
layers, respectively(Table 1).

Statisticalanalyses


The statistical analyses were carried out using SYSTAT for Windows 8.0 (Systat
1998) and EXCEL (Microsoft Excel 2002). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
carried out using the GLM procedure followed by the Tukey test for pair-wise
comparison of means. We considered statistical probabilities of p<0.05 as
significant.

K concentration of 1.7% initially, and thereafter it steadily declined to 1.1% by the
end of Grass I. In K0 the K concentrations were always less than those in the
comparable K65 material, declining rapidly to <1.0% and finally reaching 0.5%
for the last 3 years of Grass I. During Grass II, the initial K concentration was 1.5
and 0.8% for K65 and K0, respectively, and by the end of this grass period it had
reached 1.3 and 0.6%, respectively.The difference in K concentration between the
K65 and K0 treatments was statistically significant during the entire period the
plots were under grass.


_K dynamics during the growing season_


For the Grass II phase, data for individual cuts on biomass harvests and herbage K
concentration were further analysed (Table 3). The first cut (cut 1) accounted for
the major biomass yield, being roughly double that of cut 2 and three times larger
than cut 3 (Table 3).

The K65 treatment had overall a higher yield than the K0, the difference being
most pronounced for cut 1. In the K65 treatment, herbage K concentration was
highest (1.5%) in cut 1, decreasing to 1.1 and 1.0 % in cut 2 and 3, respectively
(Table 3). Herbage K concentration was low (0.7 %) in K0 and remained similar
throughout the growing season.An estimate of daily K 'uptake rate' was calculated
for individual cuts and it declined substantially from the first to the third cut in both
K65 and K0 (Table 3). The uptake rate of K was always greater for K65 than K0
and the decline was larger in K65 as compared to K0. The K uptake rate was not
significantly related (with simple linear regression) to the accumulated
precipitation during the growth period (roughlyApril-May for cut 1, June-July for
cut 2 andAugust-September for cut 3) (data not shown).

_Annual K removal and net off-takeby biomass harvest_



The total amount of K removed annually in the harvested biomass declined with
time but was always significantly greater for any given year in the K65 treatment
compared to the K0 treatment (Fig. 1c). The annual net K off-take was calculated
as the fertiliser derived input minus the K removed in harvested biomass (Fig. 1d).
During the first two years of Grass I the deficit was large, being more than 100 kg
K ha yr (Fig. 1d). Thereafter crop removal exceeded fertiliser application by 55- -1 -1
70 kg K ha yr during a five year period, followed by four years with a smaller net -1 -1
K off-take of around 30 kg ha yr . There was generally no significant difference -1 -1
in net off-take between the K0 and K65 plots during Grass I. Grass II showed a
similar pattern with a net off-take between 90 and 100 kg K ha yr the first year, -1 -1
thereafter 55-85 kg ha yr for two years, and 40 kg ha yr during the final years -1 -1 -1 -1
(Fig. 1d). There was no significant difference in net off-take between K0 and K65
for six years of Grass II.

_Input-outputK mass balances_



The input-output mass balance calculations for the entire period showed an annual
K deficit during the two grass periods (Grass I and Grass II) and a surplus during
the 6-years of cereals (Table 4). During Grass I, an average of 67 kg K ha yr was -1 -1
removed by herbage from the K0 plots whereas 128 kg K ha yr was removed -1 -1
from the K65 plots. This resulted in K removal in the herbage greatly exceeding
the amount added as fertiliser and resulted in an annual deficit of about 65 kg K ha 
1, a value that was similar for both treatments. During Grass II the annual K

removal by herbage averaged 48 and 120 kg K ha for the K0 and K65 treatments, -1
respectively, and the K mass balance calculation showed an average deficit of 47
(K0) and 56 (K65) kg K ha yr . The cereal crops all received K fertiliser, on -1 -1
average 63 (K0) and 73 (K65) kg K ha yr, and during that period the annual K -1 -1
surplus was 15 (K0) and 10 (K65) kg K ha yr (Table 4). -1 -1

both treatments, but the K0 plots overall showed a lowerAc-K than the K65 plots.
A very dry summer could be a possible explanation for the high Ac-K
concentrations recorded by the end of the 6 year of Grass I (1976).Ac-K was only th
determined on three occasions during Grass II, with the final sampling taking
place in spring, and although based on very few observations the concentrations
appeared to be at similar (or lower) levels to those measured during the Grass I
phase.


_Soil K turnover rates_


The replenishment of the Ac-K pool in the topsoil (0-15 cm) was estimated for
Grass I where annual data for net off-take (Fig. 1d) and Ac-K (Fig. 2) were
available. Replenishment was estimated based on two different assumptions (Fig.
3); (1) all K (100%) in herbage was taken up in the top 15 cm, or (2) K was taken up
proportional to the root distribution (Table 1), i.e. 63% in top 15 cm. With the first
assumption, after the initial two years, the net K off-take was about double the
amount of the Ac-K for the following 5 year period, i.e. the ratio was around 2
during this time, indicating that the Ac-K pool was replenished twice a year (Fig.
3).The K0 was replenished somewhat quicker than K65, i.e. the ratio was 2.3 (K0)
and 1.8 (K65). During the final 4 years, the net K off-take was of a similar quantity
as theAc-K pool, i.e. the ratio was close to 1 (K0 1.1 and K65 0.8), indicating that
the Ac-K pool was replenished once per year (Fig. 3). For the second assumption

At the start of the experiment the K status of the soil was moderate to low and over
time it dropped into very low status (MISR/SAC, 1985). The long-term dynamics
of Ac-K in the surface soil (0-15 cm) showed an annual variation but also a clear
difference between the years with grass compared to those with cereals, the Ac-K
concentration being lower under grass (Fig. 2). The general trend was similar for

and 0.7 (K0) and 0.5 (K65) for years 8-11, showing that theAc K pool was initially
replenished in less than a year and thereafter took between 1.5 and 2 years to
replenish (Fig. 3).


Soil K resources and their relativecontributionsto plantavailableK


_Potassium in the soil profile(rooting zone)_


The distribution of K within the soil profile (rooting zone) of the K0 and K65 plots
was determined 30 years after the start of the experiment and included the
measurement of three K fractions; Tot-K, Aq-K and Ac-K (Table 5). Potassium
concentrations were compared within profiles as well as between the K0 and K65
treatments.Tot-K concentration was significantly higher in the B and BC horizons
as compared to theAp horizons (Table 5).Asimilar pattern was apparent forAq-K.
Ac-K was significantly higher in both Ap1 horizons compared to other soil
horizons, and it was higher in the K65 treatment as compared to the K0 (Table 5).
The Aq-K fraction represented 16-20% of Tot-K in the Ap and Bs horizons
whereas it accountedfor 30% in the BC horizon.



_Soil mineralogicalcomposition and partitioningof totalK in the solid phase_


The quantitative XRPD analyses showed that about 30% of the soil minerals
contained K, and these minerals were partitioned one third as K-feldspar and two
thirds as 2:1 phyllosilicates (Table 7). The dioctahedral micas, muscovite and
illite, were the main phyllosilicates (12-15%), but there were also considerable
amounts (5-9%) of trioctahedral mica (biotite) and hydrobiotite, a common
weatheringproduct of biotite.
The partitioning of K amongst the identified mineral phases showed that on
average 55% of the K was allocated in the form of K-feldspar, 32% in dioctahedral
phyllosilicates and 12% in trioctahedral biotite and hydrobiotite. The results also
show that there was more K held in micas in the Bs- and B/C-horizons as compared
to the surface layers (Ap1-Ap3), and this was especially evident with respect to the
trioctahedralmicamineralsbiotiteand hydrobiotite(Table 8).



The quantities of K within the various extractable fractions were calculated
for the horizons of the K0 and K65 soil profiles. TheAq-K and Tot-K soil pools in
the main rooting zone (0-40 cm) approximated 13 000 and 72 000 kg K ha, -1
respectively (Table 6). The corresponding Ac-K pool was 98 and 106 kg K ha in -1
the K0 and K65 treatments,respectively.

Altogether the total K based on partitioning of K amongst the K bearing
minerals (Table 8) resulted in 100 ±10% of the directly measured Tot-K from the
XRF analyses (Table 6), slightly overestimating total K in the Ap1-horizon and
slightly underestimating it in the B-horizon, but nonetheless indicating a very
good agreementbetween the two independentestimates.

Mass balance calculations for the entire experimental period were used to estimate

exploitative nature associated with regular herbage cuts and removal means that
considerable K net off-take occurred over the 30 year experimental period. It is
readily apparent from both herbage yield and K compositional data that especially
the K0 treatment K became the growth limiting nutrient element. The coarse soil
texture (loamy sand) and granitic parent material also contributed to make this
study relevant for large areas of (medium to lower productive) agricultural land.
By combining detailed soil profile sampling including both chemical and
mineralogical analyses with these accumulated negative K balances (net K offtake) an attempt has been made to quantify the underlying mechanisms controlling
K cyclingin this soil.

the first few years of the experiment (and then appeared to have stabilized there).
This is a minor change in relation to the accumulated net off-take (deficit), leaving
1100-1150 kg K ha unaccounted for (Table 9), that presumably has originated -1
from fixed and mineral bound K sources and/or was taken up by roots in deeper
soil horizons (below 15 cm). Since the Ac-K pool in the rooting zone (0-40 cm)
was estimated at about 100 kg ha by the end of the experimental period (Table 6), -1
the main part of the K 'unaccounted' for can be assumed to have been released from
the non-exchangeable and structural mineral K pool. This means that in total 1100
kg K ha has been released from these fractions over a 30 year period which -1
corresponds to about 35 kg K ha yr . -1 -1

**Discussion**


While somewhat extreme, the zero (K0) and low (K65) fertiliser K treatment and



Herbage K concentrations reached values as low as 0.5-0.7% in the K0 treatment
(Fig. 1b), a value below that reported as the 'critical limit' for K in many previous
field studies (Whitehead 2000). First indications of a yield difference between
K65 and K0 treatments occurred at herbage concentrations of ~ 1%. However, the
species composition is an important factor to consider when determining the
critical K concentration and may explain some of the differences with published
findings. The analysis of herbage taken from individual cuts showed low K
concentrations (0.7%) all through the season in K0 whereas in K65 there was a
decline in K% with cut 3 reaching 1% (Table 3). The similar low herbage K
concentrations in K0 in all three cuts (Table 3) indicated that K probably was the
growth limiting factor all through the season and thus 'testing' the systems limits in
terms of K releasecapacity.
Øgaard et al. (2002) studied the effects of K-fertiliser application rates in
grass herbage trials (dominated by timothy, _Phleum pratense_ L., and meadow
fescue, _Festuca pratensis_ L.), and found that on sandy soils low in K there was a
positive yield response on addition of K fertiliser the second and third year where
grass K concentrations were 1.0-1.4%. Exhaustive cropping with perennial
ryegrass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) in a pot experiment, demonstrated that at
concentrations of 0.6-0.8% K (Ghorayshi and Lotse 1986) growth essentially
ceased. In long-term fertility trials (40 years) Andersson et al. (2007) found no
yield reduction and maintained grass/clover herbage K concentration of ~2% in K
nil plots on silty clay and clay soils. However, on sandy loam and loam soils
herbage concentrations were generally less than 2% K, and, although it came
down to 1% in one case, no effects on yield were recorded. The studied plots were
fertilised with N but not P or K, and possibly P had become the limiting element
prior to K in these systems, not 'pushing' the K delivering capacity as hard as in the
experimentdescribed herein.

Plant availablesoil K



Annual K off-take and soil K pools



Exchangeable and soil solution K have often been considered readily available for
plants (e.g., Sparks 1987), while fixed and structural K are less available (e.g., Pal
et al. 1999). The exchangeable K pool, usually extracted by ammonium acetate,
ammonium lactate, ammonium nitrate, acetic acid or similar, as used in soil tests
for fertiliser recommendations (e.g., Egnér et al. 1960; Thomas 1982; Rowell
1994; MISR/SAC 1985; MAFF, 1986), were replenished about 10 times during
the 30 year experiment (Tables 6 and 9), suggesting a lack of sensitivity in this
measurement to reflect actual plant availability of soil K. This indicated that
substantial amounts of “non-exchangeable” K had been released during the
experimental period and made available for plant uptake. In fact, several
studies have shown that release of fixed or structural K can contribute significantly
to plant supply (e.g., Sinclair 1979a; 1979b; Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007;
Simonsson et al. 2007) and thus calling for a new approach to 'plant available K'.
The demand for sustainable use of natural resources, including K fertiliser raw
material (mined KCl and K�SO�) that has a rather limited distribution globally 2 4
(regions such as Africa, Asia and Oceania have to rely on import) and rapidly
increasing prices of agricultural inputs are also pertinent in this regard (e.g.
Manning 2010).
In a K depleted soil the exchangeable K (i.e. Ac-K) concentration by the end
of the growing season indicates a soil specific property to bind and release K; and
whereas in certain soil types the release rate of K is slow and will restrict yields
markedly in other parent materials it will meet all crop needs (McLean andWatson
1985). After some initial years, Ac-K in Grass I was on average 39 mg kg, -1
whereas in Grass II it was 28 mg kg (Fig. 2). The lower Ac-K in the autumn in -1
Grass II might be due to the fact that three cuts were taken while in Grass I the grass
was cut only twice a year. This can be compared with the results of a pot
experiment with intensive rye grass cropping to reach K exhaustion on soils from
the same soil association (Sinclair 1979a) where the exchangeable K (average for
two course textured granitic soils of the CountesswellsAssociation) was 34 mg kg 
1 when the soil was partly depleted (after 6-8 cuts, low yield level) and 26 mg kg in -1

the more depleted soil (after 9-12 cuts, growth virtually ceased). The similarity
between the results from the field experiment and the pot trial indicates that the K
release rate has been governed by the parent material of the soil and the plant-soil
system. This includes a combination of soil mineralogy, particle size (or rather
specific surface area), rooting depth and density, efficiency in K uptake, etc., all
factors determining the soil solution K concentration and thus controlling the
diffusion of K e.g. from interlayer positions of micas (e.g. Newman, 1969;
Fanning et al 1989).

In this study, the accumulated total K net-deficit was about 1100 kg K ha, i.e. on
average 35 kg K ha yr and the question arises as to how this can be related to -1 -1,
different K sources.TheTot-K soil concentrationswere rather high, 23-28 g K kg, -1
as compared to 5-40 g K kg recorded in a range of Scottish agricultural soils -1
(Andrist-Rangel et al. 2010) and 0.4-30 g K kg reported as a typical range in -1
mineral soils globally (Sparks 1987). Thus the Tot-Kpool in the rooting zone was
very large (72 000 kg K ha ) indicating that the soil was very rich in mineral bound -1
K.The chemically definedAq-K pool (0-40 cm) was 12 000 kg ha, which equated -1
to 17% of the Tot-K. That can be compared to a study of Scottish grassland soils
showing an average extractability of 13% (9-17%, n=3) for similar soils
(CountesswellsAssociation) (Andrist-Rangel et al. 2010).
However, the type of K bearing minerals influence the potential rate of release
through mineral weathering and thus plant supply. Of the K bearing minerals that
were identified in the soil, biotite is the one most prone to release K followed by
hydrobiotite (e.g. Thompson and Ukrainczyk 2002). The estimated K pool in
terms of these minerals showed that by the end of the 30 year period the rooting
zone contained 8 000 kg K ha in the form of biotite and hydrobiotite. Assuming -1
that the C horizon is representative of the material the soil was derived from there
was originally 13 600 kg ha K in biotite and hydrobiotite (Table 8). Comparing -1
that to the present situation, the difference is 5600 kg K, which can be seen in
relation to the K off-take of 1100 kg during the last 30 years. A hypothetic
calculation of continued intensive grass production, with no or low K fertiliser
application and an annual net K off-take of 35 kg, would completely deplete the K
present in trioctahedral micas in a bit more than two centuries. Taking the relative
root distribution into account showing that most roots were in the top 25 cm the
(84%, Table 1), where the K pool in biotite and hydrobiotite was 4100 kg K ha -1
(Table 8), and applying the release (net-off take) rate of 35 kg K ha yr the K- -1 -1
biotite and -hydrobiotite pool would last for another 120 or 140 years assuming 84
and 100% uptake from this soil layer.
Although these are very rough estimates, the findings can be related to
laboratory studies of release mechanisms of interlayer K in micas. Newman
(1969) found that micas release interlayer K by cation exchange and diffusion, a
process that is governed by low solution concentration of K. The dioctahedral
micas were found to be less reactive than trioctahedral micas and thus required a
considerable (two orders of magnitude) lower solution concentration of K to
release interlayer K. The study by Newman (1969) also showed that the release
rate of K was largely independent of the proportion of mica K being exchanged.
Applying this conceptually to the results of the present study, it seems most likely
that the K delivering capacity in the experimental soil is regulated by grass uptake



1 -1



456 457


of K from the soil solution and hence the release rate of interlayer K in
trioctahedral (biotite and hydrobiotite) micas, and that the release rate might
remain at a similar level until most biotite and hydrobiotite is K depleted and
thereafter change (decrease) drastically when dioctahedral micas (and K
feldspars) becomethe main K source for plants.


Estimationof K releasefrom soil resources



Simonsson et al. (2007) found that when receiving no K (or P, but N) for 40 years, a
loamy sand soil released 8 ± 10 kg K ha yr, whereas four other soils (sandy loams -1 -1
to clays) had been releasing 40±8, 45±10, 51±12, and 65±7 kg K ha yr during the -1 -1
same period of time. This can be compared with the 35 kg K ha yr on average -1 -1
taken out from the loamy sand in this study.Asimplified view has been that the soil
K release and fixation capacity is mainly related to soil texture, particularly the
fine textured material. However, that is not fully supported by this study, or other
recent field studies (e.g., Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007; Murashkina et al. 2007),
which have shown the importance of the mineralogical composition of coarser
fractions, in particular the occurrence of biotite and hydrobiotite in the silt
fraction. The main difference between the loamy sand in this study as compared to
the one studied by Simonsson et al. (2007) was the mineralogy and in particular the
presence of biotite and hydrobiotite, in total accounting for 4-8% of the minerals in
the former but only 1-2% in the latter (Andrist-Rangel, 2008). Other differences
were numbers of years with grass or grass/clover herbage in relation to cereal
crops and the climate.
In order to predict the K weathering potential of different soils, soil
mineralogy and other soil properties, cropping systems, management practices,
climate etc have to be taken into account and a modelling approach would be
needed. Some first attempts to apply the biogeochemical steady-state model
PROFILE on some northern European agricultural soils were carried out by
Holmquist et al (2003) who estimated K weathering rates of between 3 and 82 kg
ha yr . A comparison between K release estimates from net off-take based on -1 -1
mass balance calculations (Table 9) and modelled weathering rates for the studied
Countesswells soil showed, however, a large discrepancy between field based
estimates and model predictions, 35 versus 5 (uncertainty range 2-16) kg K ha yr -1 -1
(Holmquist et al. 2003). This difference is most likely related to a combination of
factors that include the small clay content and specific surface area of the soil,
parameters that the PROFILE model is very sensitive to (e.g. Hodson et al. 1997).
There is also an issue as to how the weathering of micas is represented within the
model in terms of chemical reactions (Warfvinge and Sverdrup 1992; Sverdrup
and Warfvinge 1993) because diffusion controlled exchange of interlayer K might
be expected to be the dominant process in agricultural soils maintained at near



neutralpH values (e.g. Fanning et al. 1989).
As mentioned earlier, there are orders of magnitude differences in critical K
solution activity between di- and tri-octahedral micas (Newman, 1969; Fanning et
al. 1989), i.e. in soils with tri-octahedral micas (such as biotite) they will become
the main K source for plant supply in K depleted/low input systems. When
interlayer K in biotite has been released and dioctahedral mica (and/or K feldspar)
becomes the major K source the release rate will most probably decrease
considerably since much lower solution concentrations of K are required for
diffusion. This means that the release of K from soil resources observed in this and

other long-term experiments will not be constant over time or related to the total K
pool but very dependent on the types and amount of K bearing minerals, in
particularthe presence of tri-octahedralmicas.
The long-term field data obtained from this study in combination with the
quantitative mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of the soil and data
from the literature (e.g. controlled laboratory experiments) have demonstrated the
potential and need for further developing an approach linking mechanistic and
quantitative assessment of plant K uptake and release from mineral sources in
agricultural systems including predictions of K weathering rates. The increasing
prices of agricultural inputs such as fertilisers and the increasing awareness of
limited availability and uneven distribution of non-renewable resources
(including soils) are reinforcing a better knowledge, use and management of sitespecific resources for developing and maintaining sustainable production systems
which requires cross-disciplinary research linking up basic and applied sciences
within biogeochemistryand agriculturalsciences.

This study has shown that K became the growth limiting nutrient element all
through the growing season 'pushing' the K release capacity of the soil. The plant
(perennial rye grass) K concentration was lower (0.6-0.7%) than reported in most
previous field studies. The relation between the average annual K net-off take (35
kg ha ) and the quantified exchangeable K pool (~ 100 kg ha ), often assumed to -1 -1
represent 'plant available' K, illustrated that 'non-exchangeable' K had been
continually released and made available for plant uptake. Hence, the perception of
'plant available K' needs to be reassessed taking the dynamics of the soil K
resource(s) into account. The accumulated net K off-take (1 100 kg ha during 30 -1
year) was higher than previously reported from coarse texture soils derived from
granitic parent material. The relatively high concentration of trioctahedral micas,
i.e. biotite and hydrobiotite, was most probable the main K source. However,
assuming a continued low input management system with similar net K off-take
these easily weatherable minerals would be depleted of K within two centuries,

somethingthat needs to be considered in land-use and nutrientmanagement.
The study illustrates the strength of combining long-term field experimental
data with state of the art quantitative mineralogical methods in order to assess sitespecific resources which can form a basis to evaluate the sustainability of different
management practices. It shows how long-term field experimental data can be
utilized to obtain quantitative measures on the potential K release in low input
systems in different soil environments in order to better interpret K input/output
field mass balances, predict the long-term sustainability of different farming
practices, and suggest possible land-use and management options. Including an
integrated modelling approach would be an important component to come further
in research and implementation within this area. The increasing prices of
agricultural inputs such as K fertilisers and the increasing awareness of limited
availability of non-renewable resources are reinforcing a better knowledge and
use of site-specific resources for developing and maintaining sustainable
productionsystems.

## **State-wise approachtocropnutrientbalancesinIndia**


**TSatyanarayana RKTewatia** �


**Abstract** India registered an ever recorded food grain production of 230 mt with a

consumption of 23 mt of NPK's during 2007-08 and it was estimated that about 45
mt of nutrients are needed to produce 300 mt of food grains by 2025 to sustain the
requirement of growing population. Present intensive production systems in India
characterized by heavy removal and inadequate replenishment of nutrients
resulted in multiple nutrient deficiencies and depletion of soil nutrient reserves.
For sustaining the crop productivity and to restore the soil fertility, there is a need
to arrest depletion of soil nutrient reserves for which understanding of crop
nutrient balances is important. An attempt was made to generate information on
nutrient balances in some of the agriculturally important states considering the
present scenario of nutrient additions and crop removals at current levels of crop
production. N, P driven agriculture with neglect of K has shown an alarming
situation of negative K balance in almost all the states with reported deficiencies of
secondary and micronutrients. The present paper review the status of nutrient
balances in different states and suggests approaches for balancing the existing
nutrientgaps.

**Introduction**


Crop management in India during the past four decades has been driven by
increased use of external inputs. Fertilizer nutrients have played a major role in
improving crop productivity. During the period 1969-2008, food grain production
more than doubled from about 98 mt to a record 230 mt in 2007-08, while fertilizer
nutrient use increased by nearly 12 times from 1.95 mt to more than 23 mt in 200708 (Rao 2009). Notwithstanding these impressive developments, food grain

-1 which may aggravatein the coming years and need attention.
In India, state wise approaches to crop nutrient balances have been developed
way back in 2001 considering the nutrient additions and removal data either from
1998-99 or 1999-2000. Since then, the information on nutrient balances has not
been updated. Furthermore, for making future estimations, information on current
nutrient balances is highly essential. Therefore an attempt has been made in this
paper to generate fresh information on nutrient balances in major agriculturally
important states of India considering the recent statistics of nutrient additions and
removals as available from FAI (2008). Nutrient balance calculations in most of
the cases do not give real picture as they consider nutrient removal by crops and
addition through fertilizers neglecting contribution from sources other than
fertilizers such as organic manures, crop residues and stubbles, irrigation water
etc. However, in this paper, the authors have tried to overcome that limitation by
considering nutrient additions through organic sources wherever possible from
the information available in the published literature. While calculating nutrient
removal by crops at the present production levels, emphasis has been made to
consider removal of nutrients by fruits and vegetables in all the states; tea, coffee,
jute, rubber and other plantation crops in states wherever applicable and the total
production values have been multiplied with the nutrient uptake per tonne of
produce and arrived at removal figures. During the discussions on nutrient
balances in individual states, efforts have been made to compare the current
scenarios with that of either 1998-99 or 1999-2000, the reason being the last
nutrient balance studies were generated from the statistics of those years.
Efficiencyfactors were involvedfor calculatingnet nutrientbalances.



demand is estimated to increase to about 300 mt yr by 2025 for which the country
would require 45 mt of nutrients (ICAR 2008). With almost no opportunity to
increase the area under cultivation over 142 m ha, much of the desired increase in
food grain production has to be attained through yield enhancement in per unit
area productivity. To sustain production demands, the productivity of major crops
has to increase annually by 3.0 to 7.5 percent (NAAS 2006). Much of this has to be
met by increasing genetic potential and improved production efficiency of the
resources and inputs like water and nutrients. In addition, the growing concern
about poor soil health and declining factor productivity or nutrient use efficiency
has raised concern on the productive capacity of agricultural systems in India.
Major factors contributing to the low and declining crop responses to fertilizer
nutrients are (a) continuous nutrient mining due to imbalanced nutrient use, which
is leading to depletion of some of the major, secondary, and micro nutrients like P,
K, S, Zn, Mn, Fe and B, and (b) mismanagement of irrigation systems leading to
serious soil quality degradation. Furthermore, such low efficiency of resources
and fertilizer inputs has impacted the production costs with serious environmental

consequences.
Intensive agriculture is continuously being practiced in most of the states of
India and therefore, the problems of soil fertility exhaustion and nutrient
imbalances are bound to occur. The ill effects of exhaustive cropping systems are
reflected on production of succeeding crops. In order to maintain the optimum
level of production, it is necessary to know the nutrient requirement of crops,
fertility status of the soil and the amount of nutrient removal from the soil by crops.
During 1999-2000, the crop removal of nutrients is estimated to be about 28 mt
while the fertilizer consumption was only 18 mt with an annual nutrient gap of 10
mt. Although a part of this nutrient gap is expected to be bridged from nonchemical sources like organic manures and biological processes, still there is a
distinct gap in nutrient removal and supply leading to nutrient mining from the
native soil posing a serious threat to long term sustainability of crop production
(Hegde and Sudhakarbabu 2001). Furthermore, the country like India can hope to
achieve and sustain the desired level of agricultural production in the long run only
if we can bridge the gap between nutrient removal and addition. Therefore,
understanding the present status of plant nutrient use and removal and the resultant
nutrient balances in different states of the country with varied agro climatic
conditions would enable us for undertaking the corrective measures to bridge the
nutrient gap and help to maintain soil health and ensure the food and nutritional
security. Information on nutrient balances would also help in developing an
understanding about the annual loss of nutrients from the soil and to devise
nutrient management strategies for rational use of soil resource in sustainable
manner. It also gives insights into the level of fertilizer use efficiency and the
extent to which externally added nutrients have been absorbed by the crop and
utilized for yield production. It can also forewarn about nutrient deficiencies,

Assam



Assam has 4 m ha of gross cropped area of which 14.5 percent is irrigated. Major
portion of the soils of the state are Inceptisols (49.3 percent), followed by Entisols
(32.3 percent),Alfisols (12.3 percent) and Ultisols (6.1 percent).Amongst several
soil related constraints, high soil acidity especially in the uplands and transitional
medium lands limits nutrient availability to the crops. The principal crops grown
are rice, jute, potato, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, sugarcane, fruits, tea etc and the
cropping intensity of the state is around 145 percent. The share of area under food
grains to gross cropped area is 71 percent. A variety of cropping systems are in
practice in the state. The current fertilizer use in the state is 57.3 kg ha consisting -1

Nutrient balance scenario (Table 1) for the state ofAssam shows that the crop
removal being higher than that added, all the three NPK nutrients have a negative
balance. Nutrient mining is found to be to the tune of 0.113, 0.011 and 0.199 mt of
N, P�O and K�O, respectively. If the similar trend of mining of nutrient reserves is 2 5 2
allowed to continue without replenishment, worsen situations would lead to
deterioration of soil health and decline in crop productivity. The soils of Assam
being constrained with soil acidity, high phosphorus fixation, nutrient losses from
soil along with socio-economic problems, the state needs special attention on
adequate application of plant nutrients in order to achieve targeted crop
production. Integrated nutrient management, organic recycling and

Agriculture in Bihar is the only backbone to the overall development of state. It has
total geographical area of 9.37 m ha. The net cropped area stands at 5.7 m ha, of
which 61.1 percent is irrigated. About 89 percent of the total cropped area of the
state is under food grains and the current cropping intensity is 139.4 percent. The
principal crops grown are rice, wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, and
sugarcane along with large acreage under fruits.The state is divided into four agroclimatic regions. Three major soil groups are recognized as foothill soils in the
narrow strips of northern boundary, sedentary foot hill and forest soils in the
southern boundary and remaining soils are dominantly of alluvial origin in the
Indo-Gangetic plains. The current fertilizer use in the state is 162.8 kg ha -1

consisting of 125.5, 25.9 and 11.4 kg ha N, P�O and K�O respectively, the 2 5 2
N:P�O�:K�O use ratio being 9.9:2.2:1.0. While most of the nitrogen, phosphorus 2 5 2
and potassium are applied through urea, DAP (46 percent P�O�) and MOP (60 2 5
percent K�O) respectively, a healthy share of complex fertilizers also contributes 2
to the totalNPK consumptionin the state.
The total NPK removal by selected crops appears to be 1.30 mt as against the
fertilizer nutrient addition of 1.21 mt. Thus, a net NPK depletion of 0.09 mt was
recorded for the whole state (Table 1). The balance sheet indicates that the
maximum removal was recorded with K followed by N and P. Potassium balance
in the state is negative and this is very much expected under the situations when the
potash removals by crops is much larger than its addition through fertilizers and
other sources. The nutrient use pattern in Bihar is confined to N and P and the K
fertilization is by and large neglected in most of the cases. Due to intensive
cultivation, sulphur and micronutrients like Zn and B are also getting severely
depleted from the soil. There is a need to exploit the prevailing practices of
manuring and residue recycling, which are not satisfactory at the present level of
cultivation. Integrated plant nutrient supply system seems to have a long way to go
for maintainingsoil healthand sustaining yield in the state.

The state of Orissa is known for mono-cropping of rice with other crops like pulses
and oilseeds grown on residual moisture after rice. The state has 8.9 m ha of gross
cropped area with cropping intensity of 157 percent. Major soils of the state are
deltaic coastal soils, coastal saline soils, red and laterite soils, black soils and
brown forest soils. The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is 76
percent. The crop yields as well as crop removal of nutrients from the soil were
very low and the natural processes of nutrient cycling, biological nitrogen fixation,
addition of crop residues and FYM possibly sustained the nutrient balance of soil.

respectively with N:P�O�:K�O use ratio of 4.3:2.2:1. Though the share of Orissa to 2 5 2
all India gross cropped area is 5.3 percent but its share to all India consumption of
NPK is only 2 percent . The share of potash to total NPK consumption is 13.9
percent.
The state as a whole had a negative nutrient balance of 332 thousand tonnes of
NPK nutrients. The nutrient balance with respect to N was found to be positive by
7.2 thousand tonnes where as phosphorus was negatively balanced at 18.5
thousand ton. . The total K removal by the crops at current level of productivity is
384 thousand ton against total addition of 63 thousand ton resulting in a
severe negative K balance of 320 thousand ton. The current fertilizer use in
Orissa is extremely low and has resulted in lower yield levels of most of the
crops. Total nutrients added as fertilizers accounts for 58 percent of crop
removal and fertilizer K added is about 16 percent of K removed by the crops.

Haryana


Haryana is an agriculturally important state of Northern India having 6 m ha of
gross cropped area of which 81 percent is irrigated with cropping intensity of 170
percent. Major soils of the state are alluvial and saline - sodic with problems of
salty waters in some parts. The principal crops grown are rice, wheat, pearl millet,
cotton, sugarcane, mustard, chickpea, and potato. The share of area under food
grains to gross cropped area is 71 percent. A five-fold increase in food grain
production during the last 35 years combined with inadequate and unbalanced
nutrient supply has led to a large degree of soil nutrient 'mining' of all the essential
plant nutrients. Farmers in Haryana apply generalized quantities of N, P and Zn
and as a consequence, deficiencies of K and other nutrients are spreading in space
and time. The intensity of nutrients (N + P�O + K�O) use through fertilizers in 2 5 2

Haryana is 187.6 kg ha consisting of 144.4 kg N, 39.6 kg P�O and 3.6 kg K�O with 2 5 2
N: P�O�:K�O use ratio of 59.7:18.6:1. Though the share of Haryana to all India 2 5 2
gross cropped area is 3.2 percent but its share to all India consumption of NPK is 6
percent.The share of potash to totalNPK consumptionis only 1.93 percent.
The nutrient mining scenario in Haryana reveals that there was a gap of 0.78
mt between removal and additions of NPK nutrients through mineral fertilizers
and other organic sources in the year 2007-08 (Table 2). Except for N showing a
positive balance of 0.031 mt, both Pand K balances were found to be negative.The
N gap in the state has been improved from -22.5 thousand tonnes in 1999-2000 to
+30.8 thousand tonnes which was mainly due to increase in fertilizer consumption
from 109.13 kg ha in 1999-2000 to 187.6 kg ha in 2007-08. There is a negative -1 -1
balance of about 155 and 652 thousand tonnes of P and K in the state, which
indicate that the depletion of both Pand K would continue to increase in future, as a
result more and more areas will come under the deficiency of these nutrients.
Vinod Kumar et al. (2001) also reported a negative balance of S, Fe, Mn and Cu in
the state though the Zn balance was positive due to application of Zn in rice and
wheat crops. It is possible to narrow the gap between removal and additions
through continuous recycling of nutrients and through balanced fertilizer use and

encouraging combined use of fertilizers with organic manures, crop residues,
green manuring and biofertilisers.


Punjab



Punjab having 8.2 m ha of gross cropped area is one of the most important states of
Northern India. In Punjab, 95 percent of the gross cropped area is irrigated with
cropping intensity of 194 percent. Major soils of the state are alluvial in nature.
The principal crops grown are rice, wheat, maize, cotton, sugarcane, mustard,
chickpea, and potato. The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is
77 percent. The total nutrient consumption in the state increased by 23.5 percent,
from 1.38 mt during 1998-99 to 1.69 mt during 2007-08. The intensity of nutrients

(N + P�O + K�O) use in Punjab is 210 kg ha consisting of 162.7 kg N, 42.5 kg P�O 2 5 2 2 5
and 4.7 kg K�O with N:P�O�:K�O use ratio of 34.3:9.0:1 which evidently is highly 2 2 5 2
unbalanced.Apparently, the share of potash in totalNPK use in the Stateis only 2.3
percent,which is negligible.
Nutrient addition to crops is mainly through mineral fertilizers and the
contribution of organic sources is marginal in the state. It is evident from Table 2
that the N balance in the state is positive at 565 thousand tonnes. However, with the
current additions of 344 thousand tonnes of P�O as against 446 thousand tonnes of 2 5
crop removal, the P balance in the state is negative by 102 thousand tonnes. The
use of K in Punjab is almost negligible, whereas its removal is 36 and 129 percent
greater than that of N and P. The total K removal by the crops at current level of
productivity is 1.022 mt against total addition of 0.038 mt with the negative K
balance of 0.985 mt. (Brar 2004) reported that total K loss from Punjab soils
increased from 159 thousand tonnes in 1960-61 to 678 thousand tonnes by 200203. This wide gap in potash removal and addition has impoverished soil's potash
reserves and thus the magnitude and extent of its deficiency and crop responses to
its application are on increase in both time and space. Sulphur deficiency is
predominantly seen in the state, limiting the yields of oilseeds, pulses and cereals.
Current status of S balance is negative with mining of about 80 thousand tonnes
annually in the state (Aulakh and Bahl 2001). Amount of Zn added was several
times higher than its removal and as a result substantial amount of Zn was left in
the balance owing to its poor utilization. There is a need to implement the 4 R's
strategy of nutrient management focusing right quantity of nutrients through right
source at right time by right methods of application, which would help in bridging
the nutrientgaps in the state.

Uttar Pradesh is one of the agriculturally important states of Northern India with

17.6 m ha of gross cropped area, of which 72 percent is irrigated with cropping
intensity of 152 percent. Major soils of the state are alluvial and saline – sodic
(with some problems of salty waters) in Gangetic plains and residual soils in
Bundel Khand . The principal crops grown are rice, wheat, maize, pearl millet,
sorghum, mustard, pigeon pea, chickpea, pea, lentil, potato, sugarcane, vegetables
and fruitsThe area under food grains is 78 percent of net cropped area.The share of
Uttar Pradesh to all India gross cropped area is 14 percent but its share to all India
consumption of NPK is 17 percent. Farmers are continuously applying
generalized quantities of N, P and to some extent Zn and as a consequence,
deficiencies of K and other nutrients are spreading in space and time.The intensity
of nutrients (N +P�O + K�O) use through fertilizers in Uttar Pradesh is 149.6 kg 2 5 2

ratio of 16.0:5.3:1.The share of potash to totalNPK consumptionis only 5 percent.
In general, N and Padditions are greater than their removal by different crops
and as a result the apparent balances of both the nutrients are tending to be positive
(Table 2). However, the total K removal by major crops is reported to be 1.842 mt
against total addition of 863 thousand tonnes through fertilizers and other sources
and resulted in a negative K balance of 979 thousand tonnes thereby raising
serious concerns of K depletion from the soil. Owing to severe losses of N through
leaching and volatilization in the rhizosphere and also through severe
denitrification losses in rice soils, the existing positive N balances in the state may
not be considered as satisfactory input-output relations and therefore it may be
inferred that the current practices of cropping and nutrient management are
exhaustive in terms of N and K withdrawals, leading to greater depletion of N and
K from native soil reserves.Therefore, appropriate N and K management practices
have to be followed in order to minimize the losses to soil fertility and sustain the
crop productivityin years to come.

changed significantly from 13 : 6 : 2 during 1998-99 to 4.4 : 2.1 : 1 during 2007-08.
Per hectare consumption of total nutrients during 2007-08 was 205.3 kg as

highest per hectare consumption among the major states of southern India. The
data pertaining to crop nutrient balance in Andhra Pradesh has been shown in
Table 3.

For calculating the nutrient balances, information on nutrient additions
through fertilizers and crop removal of nutrients has been taken from FAI (2008),
whereas, the nutrient additions through organic sources has been adopted from
Singh et al. (2001). The total removal of nitrogen during 2007-08 was 0.506 mt,
with the addition of 0.786 mt. Therefore, the N balance in the state was positive
(0.281 mt) at the present level of crop production and registered a positive growth

Andhra Pradesh is one of the most progressive states with respect to agricultural
development, maintaining higher levels of crop production compared to several
other states. It is the second largest fertilizer consuming state in the country, next to
Uttar Pradesh. During the last decade, the consumption of total fertilizer nutrients
increased by 25 percent, from a total of 2.131 mt during 1998-99 to 2.667 mt

of 37.5 percent (0.073 mt) during the last ten years. The total P removal was 0.233
mt and the total P additions were 0.187 mt resulting in a net negative balance of
0.048 mt. Though there is an improvement in P balance from -0.132 mt during
1998-99 to -0.048 mt in 2007-08, there is still a need to review the fertilizer
recommendations and develop effective strategies for P management in order to
bring down the negative P balance in the state. K balance was also found to be
negative, with a total K removal of 0.709 mt and total K additions of 0.411 mt, and
the resultant K use is in a state of net negative balance of 0.297 mt. Although the
negative balance has come down from 0.431 mt during 1998-99 to 0.297 mt, there
is a need to adopt appropriate K management strategies in order to overcome the
existing negative balances. In addition to the major nutrients, Sulphur deficiencies
have been reported in light textured, low organic matter containing soils, which
are prone to subsequent leaching and among the micronutrients, zinc is the most
deficient micronutrient in the entire state. The results indicate that the farmers of

the region need to adopt the balanced fertilization strategies in order to keep the
nutrientbalancesat optimumlevels.

Karnataka state is bestowed with a wide range of soil and climatic conditions that
support myriad species of crops and farming systems. The state has been in the
fore-front in terms of adoption of newer agricultural practices and maintaining
fertilizer use (116 kg ha ) at par with the national average of 117 kg ha . The total -1 -1
nutrient consumption increased from 1.27 mt during 1999-00 to 1.51mt during
2007-08 and registered an increase of 19 percent in the consumption of total
nutrients over the last eight years. The state with 6.5 percent of the country's gross
cropped area has 6.7 percent of total fertilizer nutrients consumed in the country,
which has come down from 1999-2000 levels of 7.6 percent. The consumption of
N and K�O at 0.79 and 0.33 mt during 2007-08, registered an increase of 16.2 2
percent and 52.8 percent, respectively, over 1999-2000, and the consumption of
P�O at 0.387 mt recorded a slight increase of 1.3 percent during the period. NPK 2 5
use ratio changed from 3.2:1.7:1 to 2.4:1.2:1 during the period.
The current nutrient addition through fertilizers was worked out from FAI
(2008), which reveals that about 1.51 mt of nutrients were consumed against total
removal of 1.6 mt of nutrient by different major crops grown in the state resulting
in a negative nutrient balance of 0.092 mt of NPK that is not met through fertilizer
applications for the crop year 2007-08 (Table 3). However, considering the
nutrient availability of about 0.55 mt (Hegde and Surendrababu 2001) through
different organic sources in the state, the negative balance of 0.92 lakh tonnes of
nutrients could be considered negligible. However, the negative balance of 0.404
mt of K is a matter of concern in the state and before depleting the K reserves of the



The state of Kerala has net cropped area of only 2.1 m ha and the state produces
more than 48 percent of coconut, 97 percent of black pepper and 60 percent of
natural rubber in the country. In addition, it has a significant share of India's other
plantation produces such as coffee, tea, betel nut, cocoa and cashew, fruits such as
banana and pineapple and spices like cardamom, ginger, turmeric, nutmeg and
clove. The fertilizer nutrient consumption in the state decreased marginally by 5
percent from 0.219 mt during 1998-99 to 0.208 mt during 2007-08 and as a result,
the agricultural productivity of the state showed a continuous decline in recent
years. While, the consumption of N at 0.093 mt, registered an increase of 7.27
percent during 2007-08 over 1998-99, the consumption of P�O and K�O at 42.7 2 5 2
and 72.3 thousand ton, recorded a decline of 3.4 percent and 17.2 percent,
respectively, during the period. Present NPK use ratio of the state is 1.3:0.5 :1. The
per hectare consumption of total fertilizer nutrients is 70 kg and is far below the
nationalaverageof 117 kg ha . -1
From the nutrient balance sheet of Kerala (Table 3), it is quite obvious that the
fertilizer usage in the state is not adequate to meet the demand for crop removal.
Out of the potential demand of 0.541 mt of fertilizer nutrients, only 0.21 mt is
added through fertilizers during 2007-08 and as a result, there is a net negative
balance of 0.332 mt, which is to be supplied through additional nutrient inputs in
order to overcome excess nutrient mining form the soil. The total K removal by
major crops is reported to be 0.279 mt against total addition of 0.072 mt K through
fertilizers with a negative potassium balance of 0.206 mt and in consequence the K
reserve of the soils of the state has depleted. In addition to this, the micronutrient
deficiencies are also becoming widespread at an alarming rate (John et al. 2001).
For attaining a sustainable crop production from the state and cater to the needs of
the ever growing population, there is a need to create awareness among farmers
about the responsible management of plant nutrients through balanced and
integratednutrientmanagementstrategies.

TamilNadu


Tamil Nadu has 3.4 percent of India's gross cropped area with about 4.8 percent of
the total fertilizer consumption of the country. The total consumption of fertilizer
nutrients in the state increased from 0.79 mt during 1998-99 to 1.075 mt during
2007-08 and has registered an increase of 36 percent over 1998-99 levels. During
the last 8-9 years, the consumption of P�O and K�O is more than doubled at 0.228 2 5 2

and 0.304 mt, registered an increase of 56.2 percent and 87.6 percent, respectively.
The consumption of N at 0.543 mt, however, increased by only 12.4 percent during
this period. Per hectare consumption of total nutrients increased from 152 kg to
178 kg during the period. The NPK use ratio in the state during 2007-08 is
2.0:0.7:1.

The crop nutrient balance of the state generated as per the information given
in FAI (2008) reveals that the nutrient additions of nitrogen (0.543 mt) is slightly
higher than the removal (0.495 mt), resulting in a positive balance of about 0.049
mt (Table 3). With regard to P nutrition, the removal is slightly higher by 2800
tonnes over the Paddition through fertilizers and the resulted net negative balance
is quite manageable in the state. However, the balances pertaining to K nutrition
was significantly negative.About 0.73 mt of K was removed as against an addition
of 0.304 mt and resulted in an alarming negative balance of 0.421 mt. With
intensive cultivation at a higher stake in the state, this alarming situation would
result in depletion of native K reserves of soils and therefore demands attention of
scientists, extension workers and policy makers for taking up appropriate K
additionsthrough mineralfertilizersand other availablesources.

Gujarat having 10.69 million hectares of gross cropped area (31.5 percent
irrigated) with cropping intensity of 113 percent is one of the agriculturally
important states of Western India. The principal crops grown are groundnut, pearl
millet, rice, wheat, maize and cotton. The share of area under food grains to gross
cropped area is 36.7 percent. The Consumption of total fertilizer nutrients in the
state increased from 0.995 mt during 1999-2000 to 1.623 mt during 2007-08,
representing a significant growth of 63 percent, over the last eight years. The
consumption of all the three nutrients recorded positive growth with N, P�O and 2 5
K�O at 1.052, 0.425 and 0.146 mt during 2007-08, registered an increase of 69, 43 2
and 95 percent, respectively, over 1999-2000. The intensity of nutrients (N + P�O 2 5

use in the state is 9 percent.
A wide gap was observed between addition and removal of nutrients as
indicated by the total negative balance of 1.16 mt of NPK nutrients (Table 4). The
total removal of N during 2007-08 was 0.872 mt, however the addition was 1.053

of crop production.The total Premoval was 0.771 mt and the total Padditions were
0.425 mt resulting in a net negative balance of 0.347 mt. K balance was also found

to be negative, with a total K removal of 1.137 mt and total K additions of 0.146
mt, and the resultant K use is in a state of net negative balance of 0.991 mt. In
addition to N and P the removal of K, S and micronutrients by crops is at an
alarming rate since supplementation of these nutrients through external sources is
not adequate (Patel 2001). These observations indicate that there is an urgent need
for better soil management practices for sustenance of soil fertility and
productivity.

The consumption of total fertilizer nutrients in the state increased from 0.99 mt
during 1998-99 to 1.3 mt during 2007-08, representing a growth of 31.3 percent,
during the last ten years. The consumption of all the three nutrients recorded
positive growth. N, P�O and K�O at 0.796, 0.43 and 0.076 mt during 2007-08, 2 5 2
registered an increase of 38, 12.4 and 183 percent, respectively over 1998-99
levels. The current fertilizer use in the state is only 66.4 kg ha consisting of 40.6, -1

10.5 : 5.7 : 1.0.The share of potash in totalNPK use in the state is 5.8 percent.
The total removal of N during 2007-08 was 1.053 mt, with the addition
through fertilizers and organic manures of 0.934 mt (Table 4). Therefore, the N
balance in the state seems to be negative (0.119 mt) at present level of crop
production. P was positively balanced at 0.085 mt, however, the K balance was
extremely negative. The total K removal by major crops at current level of
productivity is 0.944 mt against total addition of 0.169 mt through fertilizers and
organic manures showing a negative balance of 0.775 mt. This wide gap in K
removal and addition has impoverished soil's K reserves and thus the magnitude
and extent of its deficiency and crop responses to its application are on increase in
both time and space.The total negative balance of NPK in the state is amounting to
0.808 mt. Apart from considering nutrient contributions from organic manures,
there are considerable quantities of crop residues, forest litters, press mud, poultry
manure, biofertilisers etc are also available in the state. Therefore, there is a need
for the development of strategies for recycling of available crop residues in order
to fulfillthe existingnutrientgap.

0.175 mt (Table 4). P removal by crops was 0.684 mt and additions through
fertilizers was 0.642 mt showing a negative balance of .042 mt.This shows that the
P use in Maharashtra was below the recommended levels of application and
therefore there is a need to increase Papplication.There is a wide gap in addition of
K to soil and their removal by crops.Although about 0.421 mt of K was added, the
removal was very high at 1.483 mt, leaving a negative balance of 1.062 mt of K.
Replenishment of S and other micronutrients is almost negligible and widespread
multi nutrient deficiencies have been reported in the state (Patil et al. 2001).
Therefore, there is a need to improve additions of deficient nutrients in the low
consuming areas along with use of organic manures and encouraging retention of
crop residues in soil.

Maharashtra, the third largest Indian state occupying 1/10 of the area of the
country enjoys varied agro-climatic situations. Black soils with swell-shrink
characteristics dominate the soil type along with lateritic, coastal alluvial, saline

recorded an impressive growth of 11.3 percent during 2007-08. Total nutrient

Rajasthan having 19.23 m ha of gross cropped area (31 percent irrigated) is one of
the agriculturally important states of Western India. The state is endowed with a
large diversity in soils from dune and associated soils to medium black soils. The
principal crops grown are pearl millet, maize, coarse millets, pulses, oilseeds,
cotton, vegetables _etc_ . The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is
59 percent. A variety of cropping systems are in practice in the state. The current
fertilizer use in the state is only 45.5 kg ha consisting of 32.5, 12.0 and 1.0 kg ha -1 -1
N, P�O and K�O respectively, the N: P�O : K�O use ratio being 57.4:16.9:1.0. The 2 5 2 2 5 2
share of potash to total NPK consumption is only 2.3 percent. The total K removal
by major crops is reported to be 1.015 mt against total addition of 0.021 mt K
through fertilizers showing negative balance of 0.994 mt and in consequence the K
reserve of the soils of the state is continuously depleting.
Based on the nutrients absorbed by the crops and nutrients added through
fertilizers, the balance sheet shows negative trend for all the three NPK nutrients
(Table 4). There is a requirement of about 0.12, 0.11 and 0.99 mt of additional NPK
nutrients to bridge the deficit in the state. Gupta (2001) reported that K mining in
Rajasthan is highest followed by N, S, P and Zn. The negative nutrient balance in
the state could be bridged through adequate use of fertilizers. There is a need to
double the present levels of nutrient consumption through additional fertilizer use
and also by supplying nutrientsthrough cattlemanure and other organic sources.

**Conclusions**


From the foregoing discussions, it is conspicuous that the nutrient use pattern in
majority of the agriculturally important states of India is inadequate and mostly
dominated by NPfertilization. The negative balance of K is highly predominant in
almost all the states, which imply that the use of K fertilizers is neglected in most



482 483


cases. K additions through the prevailing practices of manuring and residue
recycling, as well as the meager inputs through K fertilizers are not sufficient to
match the K removal by different crops and therefore, tremendous efforts are
needed to promote K consumption through use of K rich fertilizers. The current
trends of nutrient balances reveals that the gap between nutrient use and supply in
farming areas will continue to grow wide on account of intensive cropping and
therefore, there is a need to ensure proper and timely supply of major as well as
secondary and micronutrients. Other than additions through fertilizer nutrients,
practices like recycling of crop residues instead of taking back the residues away
from the field and use of animal manures through appropriate composting
processes should be encouraged than diverting the resources for fuel and other
secondary purposes.
Nutrient balance calculations, sometimes, do not give the real picture as they
consider nutrient removal by crops and addition through fertilizers neglecting
contribution from sources other than fertilizers such as organic manures, crop
residues and stubbles, irrigation water etc. Therefore, contribution of nutrients
from the available sources should be taken into account while making calculations
to the maximum extent possible. Further, if the average use efficiency of fertilizers
(N 50-60 percent; P 15-25 percent, K 60-70 percent) is taken into account, the
nutrient additions through fertilizers is much more reduced and therefore, the
removal exceeds the consumption and nutrient gap is widened. Nevertheless, the
situation is balanced by addition of the nutrients through biofertilisers, FYM,
compost, green manuring or addition of crop residues in the field. The
consumption data on secondary and micronutrient fertilizers are not available.
There is a need to compute nutrient balances with respect to secondary and
micronutrients, giving emphasis primarily to the most limiting nutrients like S, Zn
and B.
