**Abstract**


Fertilizer use in India is highly unbalanced especially with respect to potassium
(K). Long-term fertilizer experiments conducted over 30 years in different agroecological regions involving diversified cropping systems and soil types showed
significant responses of crops to K applications, the effects being more
pronounced in Alfisols and acidic Inceptisols (Aeric Haplaquept). After several
years of intensive cropping, response to K application occurred even in alluvial
soils dominated by K bearing minerals (illite). Application of K enhanced its
available status in soils and uptake by the crops. Contribution of the nonexchangeable K towards total potassium removal was above 90% in the absence
of applied K which decreased to about 80% with the use of K. Studies on K
release kinetics and Q/I parameters showed that cumulative K release was
higher in K treated soils as compared to untreated ones thereby causing a
greater decline in non exchangeable K reserves. The results suggest that in
years ahead K will be the most limiting factor affecting sustainability of intensive
cropping systems in India. Therefore, due attention must be paid to K nutrition
in fertilizer scheduling for different crops/cropping systems.


**Introduction**


In most of the intensive cropping systems in India, potassium (K) balance is
negative since the additions of K seldom match the K removals resulting in
larger dependence on soil K supply. Under such conditions there is greater
pressure on non-exchangeable K for meeting the K requirement of crops.
Long-term intensive cropping, in the absence of K inputs, adversely affected
the K supply to crop plants and consequently crop yields (Swarup, 1998;
Swarup and Ganeshmurthy, 1998). Potassium deficiencies are now more

widespread even on heavy textured soils such as alluvial illitic soils in India.
Several studies have shown substantial contribution of non-exchangeable K
towards K nutrition of crops grown on illite dominant alluvial soils (Srinivasa
Rao _et al.,_ 2001; Swarup and Chhillar, 1986). This is particularly so when
cropping continues with N + P application without K addition. The K release
rates from soils under long-term cropping, fertilization and manuring helps
to predict the fate of added K in soil as well as nature of K supply from soil
to plant K nutrition. This paper critically reviews the work done on soil
potassium and its impact on the sustainability of crop production under the
All India Coordinated Research Project of ICAR on Long-term Fertilizer
Experiments.


**Crop responses and K uptake vis-à-vis sustainability issues**


It is generally considered that most of the Indian soils are adequate in K
supply. Cereals especially those with deep rooting system often fail to respond

to K in seasonal/short term field trials. The immediate conclusion drawn

could be that no K is required for such cereals at these locations. However,
the situation changes when intensive cropping is followed over the years on

the same site with N + P fertilizer alone because with consecutive exhaustion

the true response to K becomes obvious. For example, the crops under longterm experiments on a Mollisol soil at Pantnagar (Nand Ram, 1998) and
Vertisol soil at Jabalpur (Tembhare _et al.,_ 1998) responded to K only after few
years of cropping because of its good spatial K exploitation whereas trend in
yield declines occurred from the beginning in Alfisols at Bangalore, Ranchi
and Palampur and in an Inceptisol (Aeric Haplaquept) at Bhubaneswar ( **Figs.**
**1 to 4, Table 1** ). Even in K rich alluvial soil (Typic Ustocrept) at Ludhiana,
maize and wheat responded to K application from the very beginning (Brar
and Pasricha, 1998). A comparison of mean response of K (NPK over NP)
showed that yield responses to N and P fertilizer declined in all the soils, the
effects being more pronounced in Alfisols and more so at Bangalore under
finger millet-maize cropping system ( **Table 1** ). On the contrary, a declining
trend in response to K fertilizer was observed in maize at Ludhiana and rice
at Pantnagar after about 10 years of continuous cropping. It was found to be
associated with the emergence of Zn deficiency. Thus it can be inferred that
the real response to K fertilization can be fully realised only when all the
limiting plant nutrients (secondary and micronutrients) are present in optimal
amounts in the soil ( **Table 2** ). The K uptake by crops even at 100% optimal
NPK dose was far in excess of the fertilizer K applied to the crops on almost

all soils thereby indicating continuous mining of soil K from non-exchangeable
reserves (Swarup and Wanjari, 2000). The uptake data of various crops suggest
that fertilizer K recommendations for crops should take into consideration
non-exchangeable fraction of soil K.


The change in the cumulative release of K after 20 years of cropping from
an Inceptisol at Hyderabad ( **Fig. 5** ) indicated the relative contribution of soil
reserve K (non-exchangeable K) in crop K uptake. While there were fewer
changes in the available K form during the period of 20 years, change in nonexchangeable K was more conspicuous. This shows the need to include nonexchangeable K in soil testing methodology, as it was more sensitive to crop
K removal (Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 2000). Similarly, there was considerable
decrease in K release from non-exchangeable fraction of soil K with 20 years
of cropping ( **Fig. 6** ).

**Build up and Depletion of Soil K**


1. Continuous application of nitrogenous fertilizers alone to soils had a
deleterious effect on soil productivity especially in soils deficient in P and
K; the effects being more pronounced on Alfisols (Palampur, Ranchi and
Bangalore). The available K status in these plots declined to less than
critical levels ( **Fig. 7** ). 150% NPK or 100% NPK+FYM maintained higher
available pools of K.


2. At Ludhiana and Palampur total productivity in the maize-wheat system
increased over the years, mainly due to increased productivity of Wheat.
This reflects that although the K level in the soil has improved over the
years with the application of NPK but yet their optimum levels in the soil
have not been attained. This behaviour is confirmed by available K status
in the soil at both these centres. Similarly, in soybean-wheat system at
Ranchi, the wheat yield has shown increasing trend over the years,


_**176**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_


obviously, due to improved status of K in the soil in NP treatment over
N as the soil had deficiency of K to start with.


3. There is also evidence at many centres that the crops started drawing on
the non-exchangeable source of K when the exchangeable K amount fell
below the critical limits. An excellent example of such a change is provided
by the experiment at Jabalpur and Bhubneswar centres. The results clearly
showed that mining of soil K occurred even with NPK treatment. It is
indicated that under intensive cropping, the K deficiency will gradually
increase unless adequate quantity of K is added from external sources
such as fertilizers and manures. Likewise, the results of experiments on
finger millet-rabi maize cropping system at Bangalore clearly indicate
that certain treatments with N alone or NP depressed the yields to the
same level as the unmanured plot whereas with NPK or NPK + FYM
treatments, the yields were stable at higher level. The available K status

of the soil indicated that the soil was not able to meet the K demand of

the crops. Thus severe K deficiency is limiting the responses to NP.

4. The declining trend in yield at many centres indicates the need for critical
examination and modification of the existing K fertilizer recommendation
to compensate for gradual loss of native soil K fertility. Results at
Bhubaneswar centre ( **Table 3** ) with superimposed treatments showed that
enhanced dose of K in excess of 100% NPK is extremely important for
improving rice-rice productivity and maintaining available K in the soils.

**Non-exchangeable K release rates in different soil types under intensive**
**cropping**


Some workers have shown that intensive cropping for a long period would
reduce the exchangeable K to a minimum level and at this level the release
of non-exchangeable potassium starts (Sachdeva and Khera, 1980). Krishna
Kumari _et al._ (1984) investigated the potassium release behaviour of an
inceptisol (Holambi series) at the minimum level of exchangeable potassium
and found that there was no response to potassium fertilizer applications,
even when the soil was intensively fertilized with N and P without addition
of potassium for ten years. Consecutively no K deficiency symptoms were
exhibited by maize and wheat crops. On the basis of six successive cropping
with pearlmillet, Mehta (1976) found that non-exchangeable K contributed
81% of the total K removed by plants in the alluvial soils of Gujarat. The
reason proposed for the rapid release of non-exchangeable K under intensive
cropping is that a concentration gradient is set up from high concentration of
K in unexpanded towards the K depleted expanded part of the clay (Thomas,
1967).


Use of organic acids to extract non-exchangeable K from soil is believed
to match the root extraction to soil K during intensive cropping. The
cumulative K release was higher in Vertisols followed by Inceptisols and


_**178**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_


Alfisols. Smectitic soil released about 25% whereas illitic soil released about

13% of non-exchangeable K to in malic acid.


Even though illite or mica is the primary source of non-exchangeable K in
Inceptisols as well as Vertisols, the relative mobility of K from the illite minerals
of Inceptisols is less compared to that of Vertisols. This is also observed from
lower release rate constants of Inceptisols (3.5 h [–1] ), compared to Alfisols (3.52
h [–1] ) and Vertisols (4.03 h [–1] ). Differences in the composition of illite such as
biotite or muscovite could make a very substantial difference in K release
between Vertisols and Inceptisols (Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 2001).


**Changes in non-exchangeable K and its contribution to plant K uptake**


Change in Non-exchangeable K of soils under intensive cropping has been
observed in many cases irrespective of the available K status and dominant
minerals of soils. Effect of long-term rice-rice cropping, fertilisation and
manuring on K release pattern in 0.01 M CaCl 2 and by electro-ultra filtration
(EUF) fraction (Srinivas Rao _et al.,_ 2000) indicated a substantial reduction in
K release from soils due to continuous cropping. Application of 100% NPK
+ 15 t FYM maintained higher K release whereas 100% NP showed the lowest
K release. Non-exchangeable K released during 30-35 minutes in EUF
extraction also indicated a similar change. It can be observed from the pattern
of EUF desorption that K desorbed during the first 30 minutes (which indicates
exchangeable from of K) did not vary much among treatments whereas the
differences were much clear in EUF 30-35 K (Non-exchangeable K). Nonexchangeable release rate constants of Inceptisol as influenced by 14 years of
rice-rice cropping, fertilization and manuring ( **Table 4** ) also indicated
considerable decrease in non-exchangeable K release due to cropping

(Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 1999). The differences were more clear during initial 73
hours of extraction as compared to release rates for the entire period of

incubation.


Ten cycles of maize-wheat cropping at Ludhiana substantially reduced the
non-exchangeable K especially under higher level of N and P application
whereas application of 100 kg K ha [–1] decreased the extent of change in nonexchangeable K ( **Fig. 8** ) at Ludhiana (Brar and Pasricha, 1998). Contribution
of non-exchangeable K towards K uptake by crops as a result of K application
decreased from 97% to 81% in a Vertisol at Jabalpur whereas it decreased
from 100% to 27% in an Aeric Haplaquept at Bhubaneswar ( **Table 5** ). Reduction
in non-exchangeable K under long-term cropping of finger millet-maizecowpea sequence was observed in a Vertic Inceptisol at Coimbatore and under
soybean-wheat-cowpea system at Jabalpur. In both the cases reductions were
of larger magnitude in the absence of K supply (NP treatment) as compared
to 100% NPK + FYM treatment. Similar observations were made by Subba
Rao _et al._ (1993) in another long-term fertilizer experiment on alluvial soils
with sorghum-wheat cropping at PRII, Gurgoan.

**Quantity/Intensity relationships**


Several researchers have used the quantity/intensity (Q/I) technique, which
is the relationship between the amount (Q) present and the availability or
intensity (I), to assess the status of soil potassium (K). Several studies have
investigated the influence of K fertilization strategies on (Q/I) parameters in
soil. These studies, however, did not evaluate the long-term effects of cropping,
K fertilization and manuring on the Q/I relation in soils. Long-term
experiments are an important means for obtaining information on the longterm sustainability of agricultural systems. A knowledge of Q/I relationship
of potassium in soil together with their distribution in the zone of root
penetration helps to predict the fate of added K in soil profile as well as
nature of K supply from subsoil layers to plant K nutrition particularly in
deep rooted crops and in formulating sound fertilizer recommendations.


Long-term cropping, fertilization, and manuring in a Typic Ustocrept at
Delhi influenced the K supplying power of the top soil and subsoil layers,
the effects being more pronounced on top soil. The highest and lowest values
of equilibrium activity ratio (AR ek ), labile pool of K (K L ), non-specific or
immediately available K ( K 0 ) and specific or difficulty available K (K X )
were observed in 100% NPK+FYM and 100% NP plots, respectively at all
depths. Despite low AR ek, K L and free energies of exchange for the replacement
of calcium with potassium ( G) values in control, N and NP plots, maize,
wheat and cowpea did not show any deficiency symptoms thereby indicating
that sufficient K is being released from non-exchangeable K source (Rupa _et_
_al._, 2001).


**Conclusions**


The long-term fertiliser experiments being carried out in different
agroecological regions of India involving diversified intensive cropping
systems and soil types have established increasing crop responses to K
application, the effects being more pronounced in Alfisols and Inceptisols as
compared to Vertisols and Mollisols. Continuous monitoring of available and
non-exchangeable K status is extremely important for making sound K
fertilizer recommendations for sustaining crop productivity in different soil

types.
