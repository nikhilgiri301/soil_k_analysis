Rice, a staple crop in Asia, is critical for the region’s food security. However, intensive
rice farming has led to substantial potassium (K) depletion in soils, undermining
soil fertility and crop productivity. This study assessed the impact of different K
management strategies on soil K dynamics, balance, and crop uptake in a puddled,
transplanted rice–rice system in Odisha, India, during dry (December–April) and
wet (June–October) seasons. The experiment involved nine treatments, including
combinations of chemical fertilizers, straw application, and foliar spray, arranged
in a randomized block design (RBD). Grain yield was significantly higher when
applying chemical fertilizer and foliar spray (3.9 t ha [−][1] in the dry season and 5.4 t ha [−][1]
in the wet season) compared to the control (2.7 and 4.2 t ha [−][1], respectively).
Higher levels of exchangeable and reserve K were retained with chemical fertilizer
applications, while reduced fertilizer doses combined with straw utilized more
non-exchangeable K. The dry season exhibited a greater shift in non-exchangeable
K, indicative of larger soil K depletion. Treatments combining reduced fertilizer
doses with straw yielded a positive K balance, in contrast to the negative balance
observed with chemical fertilizers alone. Correlation analyses indicated that reserve
and non-exchangeable K significantly contributed to maintaining available K levels
in the soil solution, thereby supporting continuous crop K uptake. These findings
highlight the necessity of integrating reserve and non-exchangeable K dynamics
into nutrient management strategies to ensure sustainable rice production.

## 1 Introduction


Rice is an essential crop for global food security, particularly in Asia, where it is a primary
dietary staple. As one of the leading rice-producing nations, India has approximately 35% of
its agricultural land for rice cultivation, contributing nearly 40% to the total food grain
production. Despite this significant contribution, rice productivity in India remains suboptimal
due to many agronomic and resource-related challenges (Sreekanth et al., 2017; Singh et al.,

2021
). This disparity necessitates a more sustainable approach to enhancing rice yield while
ensuring soil health and long-term agricultural viability.

Potassium (K), an essential macronutrient, plays a pivotal role in the growth and
productivity of rice. It is involved in critical physiological processes such as enzyme activation,

osmoregulation, and photosynthesis, directly influencing yield and
quality. However, intensive rice farming practices, driven by the need
to meet the demands of a growing population, have led to substantial
depletion of soil K reserves, undermining soil fertility. Studies have
shown that Indian soils are predominantly deficient in potassium, with
approximately 50% categorized as K-deficient (Srinivasarao et al., 2011;
Sanyal et al., 2014). The reliance on imported potassic fertilizers,
coupled with insufficient application rates, exacerbates this issue,
leading to a negative soil K balance (Kumar et al., 2018). The
introduction of high-yielding rice varieties during the Green
Revolution further intensified nutrient depletion in soils. It is estimated
that rice removes approximately 15 kg of nitrogen (N), 4 kg of
phosphorus (P 2 O 5 ), and 24 kg of K 2 O per ton of grain produced
(Attanandana et al., 2010). Despite this, the recommended dose of
potassic fertilizer for wetland rice in India is only 40–60 kg of K 2 O per
hectare, which is significantly lower than the recommended nitrogen
application rates (Saha et al., 2009; Mohapatra et al., 2017). Persistent
under application of K fertilizers has led to a negative K balance,
particularly in soils subjected to continuous rice cultivation. This
imbalance not only reduces soil K availability but also affects the uptake
efficiency of other essential nutrients, thereby limiting crop productivity.

An emerging challenge in rice production is the depletion of both
exchangeable and non-exchangeable forms of soil potassium (Das
et al., 2022). Research has indicated that while exchangeable K can
be replenished through fertilizer applications, non-exchangeable and
reserve K contribute significantly to the crop’s nutrient requirements
(Rao and Srinivas, 2017). Over time, intensive cultivation practices
have reduced the soil’s ability to release non-exchangeable K,
necessitating alternative management strategies to maintain soil
fertility (Lalitha and Dhakshinamoorthy, 2014; Alomar and Jena,
2023). Integrating organic and inorganic nutrient sources has been
proposed as a sustainable approach to address these challenges. Crop
residue incorporation, for instance, not only enhances soil organic
matter but also contributes to the slow release of K, thereby improving
soil K dynamics. Since 90% of the world’s rice is produced in Asia,
managing rice straw after harvest is crucial to the rice production cycle.
In Asia, rice is traditionally harvested by hand, with only a small
amount of straw left in the field, after being cut and carried to a central
threshing place for grain and straw separation. Since rice straw was
regarded as a waste commodity, it was either burned or turned into
animal bedding or fodder. However, with the increasing use of combine
harvesters in the region, large amounts of rice straw are now left in the
field. Studies have shown that _in situ_ incorporation of rice straw into
the soil enhances nutrient recycling, increases soil organic carbon (C),
and improves the yields of subsequent crops (Gupta et al., 2007;
Chivenge et al., 2020). Studies have demonstrated that when combined
with reduced doses of chemical fertilizers, straw soil application can
improve the K balance and maintain soil health (Witt et al., 1999; Hou
et al., 2021). Similarly, foliar application of potassium nitrate has been
found to enhance nutrient use efficiency and crop productivity under
various stress conditions (Brar and Brar, 2004; Adhikari et al., 2019).

Given the critical role of potassium in rice cultivation and the
pressing need for sustainable nutrient management practices, this
study aims to evaluate the effects of different K management strategies
on soil K dynamics, crop uptake, and grain yield in a puddled,
transplanted rice–rice cropping system. The experiment, conducted
in Odisha, India, during dry and wet seasons, included treatments
combining chemical fertilizers, straw application, and foliar sprays. By
analyzing the contributions of exchangeable, non-exchangeable, and



reserve K to the overall nutrient supply, this study seeks to provide
insights into optimizing potassium management for enhanced
productivity and soil health.

This research addresses key questions relevant to sustainable
rice farming: How do different potassium management practices
influence soil K dynamics across seasons? What role do
non-exchangeable and reserve K play in maintaining soil fertility?
And how can integrated nutrient management approaches
contribute to a positive K balance while sustaining high crop
yields? The findings aim to inform nutrient management strategies
that are not only effective but also economically viable and
environmentally sustainable for smallholder rice farmers in India
and similar agroecological contexts.

## 2 Materials and methods


2.1 Experimental site and climate


The field experiment was conducted at the Central Research
Station of Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT),
Bhubaneswar, India (20°15′N, 81°52′E; 25.5 m above sea level), during
the dry (December–April) and wet (June–October) seasons. The site
is in the Eastern and South-Eastern Coastal Plain agroclimatic zone,
characterized by a hot and humid climate. The mean annual rainfall
is 1,467 mm, approximately 70% occurring between July and
September. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures are
33.2°C and 21.4°C, respectively. The soil at the site is sandy loam with
a pH of 5.87, medium organic carbon (0.39%), low nitrogen (alkaline
KMnO 4 -N: 170 kg ha [−][1] ), high phosphorus (0.5-M NaHCO 3 -P:
21 kg ha [−][1] ), and low exchangeable potassium (1 N NH 4 OAc-K:
58 kg ha [−][1] ). Non-exchangeable and reserve potassium was measured
at 123 and 181 kg ha [−][1], respectively, in the 0–15-cm soil depth. At
15–30- and 30–45-cm depths, exchangeable potassium was 59 and
53 kg ha [−][1], respectively, with corresponding increases in
non-exchangeable and reserve potassium. As a result of the shallow
water table (1 m), the land remains poorly drained during the rainy
season but moderately well drained during the summer.


2.2 Treatments


The experiment was designed as a randomized block design
(RBD) with three replications to evaluate nine treatments: T 1 served
as the control with no potassium application; T 2 involved the
application of 40 kg K₂O ha [−][1] ; T 3 involved 60 kg K₂O ha [−][1] ; T 4 included
80 kg K₂O ha [−][1] ; T 5 combined 20 kg K₂O ha [−][1] with straw (3 t ha [−][1] ); T 6
used 30 kg K₂O ha [−][1] with straw; T 7 combined 40 kg K₂O ha [−][1] with
straw; T 8 incorporated straw alone; and T 9 involved 40 kg K₂O ha [−][1]
combined with a 1% KNO₃ foliar spray at the panicle initiation stage.
The treatments were categorized broadly into control (T 1 ), fertilizer K
(T 2, T 3, and T 4 ), fertilizer K with straw (T 5, T 6, and T 7 ), straw only (T 8 ),
and fertilizer K with foliar spray (T 9 ).


2.3 Crop management


The medium-duration (120–125 days) rice variety “Lalat” was used
in the rice–rice cropping system. The experimental plots measured

Mohapatra et al. [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311)



6 m × 5 m, with seedlings (25 days old) transplanted at a 20 cm × 10 cm
spacing. Each plot received 30 kg N ha [−][1] (urea), 40 kg P ha [−][1]
(diammonium phosphate), and 25 kg Zn ha [−][1] (ZnSO₄) at transplanting.
An additional 50 kg N ha [−][1] was applied in two splits (2:1 ratio) at 20
and 50 days after transplanting (DAT). Potassium was applied as
muriate of potash (MOP) in two equal splits at basal application and
50 DAT. Weed management included pretilachlor application
(500 mL ha [−][1] ) at the initial stage, followed by manual weeding as
needed. The pest and disease management included applications of
SAAF (2 g L [−][1] ), streptocycline (0.15 g L [−][1] ), and Furadan (10 kg acre [−][1] ).


2.4 Straw addition and management


For treatments involving straw incorporation, panicles were
removed, leaving 5 cm of straw, and the field was allowed to dry before
incorporation. The straw was mixed into the soil using a power tiller
to a shallow depth, followed by a second plowing after 15 days to
enhance decomposition. Approximately 3 t ha [−][1] of straw, contributing
~45 kg K ha [−][1], was incorporated into designated plots.


2.5 Soil sampling and analysis


Soil samples were collected from three depths—0–15, 15–30, and
30–45 cm—at the beginning of the experiment, mid-season at 30 and
60 DAT, and after harvest. The collected samples were air-dried,
crushed, and sieved through a 2-mm mesh before analysis.
Exchangeable potassium was determined using the ammonium
acetate method (Hanway and Heidel, 1952), while reserve potassium
was extracted with nitric acid following the method developed by
Wood and De Turk (1941). Non-exchangeable potassium was
measured using the procedure described by Black (1965). Soil pH
(Jackson, 1968), nitrogen content using the alkaline KMnO4 (Subbiah
and Asija, 1956), and phosphorus using the sodium bicarbonate
extraction method (Page, 1982) were also analyzed.


2.6 Plant sampling and analysis


Plant samples were collected at maximum tillering, panicle
initiation, and harvest stages. Samples were dried (70 ± 5°C), weighed,
and ground using a Willey mill. Potassium content was analyzed at all
growth stages. Grain and straw samples at harvest were digested using
HNO 3 –HClO 4 (3:2), diluted with distilled water, and analyzed using a
flame photometer. Phosphorus content was determined using the
Vanadomolybdate yellow color method, and nitrogen was analyzed
using the micro-Kjeldahl method.


2.7 Statistical analysis


Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Gomez
and Gomez, 1984; Panse and Sukhatme, 1961). The least significant
difference (LSD) at a 0.05 probability level was used to compare
treatment means. Correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate
relationships between variables, and figures were prepared using
GRAPES 1.1.0 (Kerela Agriculture University) (Gopinath et al., 2020).


## 3 Results

3.1 Grain yield


The K management practices significantly influenced grain yield
in both dry (DS) and wet (WS) seasons. In the DS, grain yield ranged
from 2.69 t ha [−][1] in the control (T 1 ) to 3.84 t ha [−][1] in T 9, which
combined 40 kg K₂O ha [−][1] with a 1% KNO₃ foliar spray (Table 1).
Treatments T 3, T 4, and T 6 yielded at par with T 9, while other treatments
produced significantly lower yields, and in the WS, grain yield varied
between 4.21 t ha [−][1] in T 1 and 5.35 t ha [−][1] in T 9 . The treatment T 9 was
at par with T 4, T 6, and T 7 and differed significantly from all
other treatments.


3.2 Plant K uptake


Potassium uptake by the crop was lower in the DS than that of the
WS at all growth stages. Maximum K uptake in the DS occurred
between panicle initiation (PI) and harvest, whereas in the WS, the
uptake was demonstrated to be higher between maximum tillering
(MT) and PI (Figure 1). In the DS, K uptake at MT ranged from
16.1 kg ha [−][1] (T 8 ) to 19.1 kg ha [−][1] (T 9 ), while in the WS, uptake at the
same stage ranged from 21.9 kg ha [−][1] (T 8 ) to 30.7 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ). At
harvest, total K uptake in the DS varied between 74 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) and
147 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ), while in the WS, it ranged from 87 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 and
T 5 ) to 156 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ).


3.3 Exchangeable K


Exchangeable K levels were generally higher in the DS compared
to the WS. In the DS, exchangeable K in the surface layer (0–15 cm)
ranged from 68.5 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 117.8 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ) at MT, whereas in
the WS, it ranged from 42.4 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 81.7 kg ha [−][1] (T 6 ) at the

same stage (Figure 2). In the subsurface layer (15–30 cm),
exchangeable K in the DS varied from 42.1 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 78.4 kg ha [−][1]
(T 4 ), while in the WS, it ranged from 33.1 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 55.3 kg ha [−][1]
(T 7 ). At PI in the DS, surface exchangeable K varied from 56.2 kg ha [−][1]
(T 1 ) to 94.7 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ), with subsurface values ranging between
49.9 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) and 72.2 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ). At harvest, exchangeable K in
the DS ranged between 47.9 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) and 79.6 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ) in the
surface and 48.8 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 62.5 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ) in the subsurface. In
the WS, exchangeable K at harvest ranged from 35.6 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to
63.3 kg ha [−][1] (T 3 ) in the surface and 47.1 kg ha [−][1] (T 5 ) to 70.9 kg ha [−][1]
(T 3 ) in the subsurface.


3.4 Non-exchangeable K


Non-exchangeable K (NE-K) varied significantly among treatments,
particularly in the DS (Figure 3). At MT in the DS, surface NE-K
(0–15 cm) ranged from 35.5 kg ha [−][1] (T 8 ) to 97.9 kg ha [−][1] (T5), while in
the subsurface layer (15–30 cm), NE-K ranged from 74.5 kg ha [−][1] (T 8 ) to
147.7 kg ha [−][1] (T 5 ). In the WS, surface NE-K ranged from 78.8 kg ha [−][1]
(T 5 ) to 111.2 kg ha [−][1] (T 2 ), while subsurface values varied between
68.0 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) and 140.5 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ) (Figure 3). At harvest in the DS,
surface NE-K ranged from 83.3 kg ha [−][1] (T9) to 152.4 kg ha [−][1] (T 3 ), while
subsurface NE-K varied between 63.6 kg ha [−][1] (T 5 ) and 106.2 kg ha [−][1] (T 3 ).
In the WS, surface NE-K at harvest ranged from 164.7 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to
226.2 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ), with subsurface values ranging from 130.6 kg ha [−][1]
(T 8 ) to 149.5 kg ha [−][1] (T 5 ).



3.5 Reserve K


Reserve K levels were consistently higher in the DS compared
to the WS. At MT, reserve K in the DS ranged from 144 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 )
to 215 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ) in the surface soil (0–15 cm), while in the
subsurface soil (15–30 cm), it ranged from 148 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to
215 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ). In the WS, surface reserve K varied from
124 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 173 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ), while in the subsurface layer, it
ranged from 101 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 186 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ) (Figure 4). At
harvest in the DS, reserve K in the surface soil ranged between
132 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) and 232 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ), while subsurface values
ranged from 156 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 161 kg ha [−][1] (T 4 ). In the WS, surface
reserve K at harvest ranged from 200 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to 306 kg ha [−][1]
(T 4 ), while subsurface values varied from 193 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) to
203 kg ha [−][1] (T 6 ).


3.6 Correlation of soil K forms with K
uptake


Correlation analysis showed significant relationships between
different forms of soil K and plant K uptake (Figure 5). Total K uptake
was significantly correlated with available K at MT (R [2] = 0.63), PI
(R [2] = 0.49), and harvest (R [2] = 0.50) stages. Reserve K at PI and harvest
stages also significantly correlated with total K uptake (R [2] = 0.52).
Non-exchangeable K significantly correlated with K uptake at MT
(R [2] = 0.43).

3.7 K balance and partitioning of K uptake


Potassium balance varied significantly among treatments and
seasons (Table 2). In the DS, K balance ranged from −103 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 )
to 53 kg ha [−][1] (T 5 ). In the WS, the K balance varied between



−87 kg ha [−][1] (T 1 ) and 65 kg ha [−][1] (T 6 ). Annually, the total K balance
ranged from −140 kg ha [−][1] (T 9 ) to 89 kg ha [−][1] (T 7 ). Treatments receiving
straw, either alone or in combination with reduced K fertilizer doses,

exhibited positive K balances, whereas treatments with higher K
fertilizer doses alone showed negative balances.

FIGURE 4
Reserve (kg ha [−][1] ) at different growth stages of rice crop during DS and WS.



The partitioning of K uptake differed between seasons (Figure 1).
In the WS, 16–18% of total K uptake occurred by MT, 38–44%
between MT and PI, and 40–44% between PI and maturity. In
contrast, in the DS, 12–13% of total K uptake occurred by MT, 23–27%
between MT and PI, and 59–64% between PI and maturity. These
results highlight the greater reliance on post-PI K uptake in the DS
compared to the WS.

## 4 Discussion


4.1 Grain yield and K uptake


Grain yield and K uptake were significantly influenced by applying
K through fertilizers, straw incorporation for two seasons, and foliar
sprays. The study observed higher grain yields in the wet season (WS)
than in the dry season (DS), which can be attributed to differences in
climatic conditions and water availability, enhancing nutrient uptake
efficiency during the WS. Fertilizer treatments with higher K doses or
fertilizers combined with straw generally resulted in higher yields than
control or straw-only treatments. This aligns with the findings from
Kumar et al. (2018), who emphasized the positive impact of integrated
nutrient management on rice productivity.

Interestingly, the partitioning of K uptake varied between
seasons. In the DS, a larger proportion of K uptake occurred postpanicle initiation (PI), with 59–64% of the total K absorbed during
this stage, underscoring the importance of late-season K availability.
Conversely, in the WS, K uptake was more evenly distributed across
the growth stages, with 38–44% absorbed between maximum tillering
and PI and 40–44% between PI and maturity. These patterns
corroborate earlier studies by Kumbhar and Sonar (1979) and Kalita



(2020), highlighting the need for season-specific K management to
optimize crop uptake and yield.


4.2 Changes in soil potassium


The study showed that available K (measured as exchangeable K)
was consistently higher in the topsoil than in the subsoil across both
seasons. However, the DS recorded higher available K levels than the
WS. This can be attributed to greater K release from soil reserves
during the DS, possibly due to soil drying and reduced leaching. As
observed in other studies, the decline in available K from the MT to
PI stage in the surface soil reflects active crop uptake (Lalitha and
Dhakshinamoorthy, 2014). The treatments receiving fertilizers
maintained higher available K levels than control or straw-only
treatments, demonstrating the efficacy of chemical fertilizers in
replenishing soil K. The integration of straw with fertilizers also
maintained relatively high available K levels, suggesting that straw
contributes to the slow release of K over time, consistent with findings
by Saha et al. (2009). Incorporation of rice straw has also been
observed to improve soil pH, soil organic C, and overall nutrient
content as compared to the initial conditions (Thanh et al., 2016).

Non-exchangeable K played a significant role in maintaining K
availability during crop growth. The conversion of NE-K to exchangeable
forms was evident in the DS, where NE-K levels declined at harvest. This
indicates active soil K release to meet crop demands, particularly under
intensive cropping conditions due to dynamic equilibrium (Wihardjaka
et al., 2022). The higher NE-K levels recorded in the WS at harvest can
be attributed to reduced crop uptake and enhanced K retention due to
higher soil moisture levels (Venkateshwarlu et al., 2014). The study’s
findings underscore the need to consider NE-K dynamics in nutrient

management strategies, as this form serves as a critical reservoir for
replenishing soil K during periods of high crop demand.

Reserve K, the most stable form of soil K, showed seasonal
fluctuations. In both DS and WS, reserve K declined from MT to PI,
followed by an increase at harvest. This pattern suggests the
mobilization of reserve K to meet crop needs during critical growth
stages, followed by replenishment through root turnover and
microbial activity. The higher reserve K levels in the WS than those of
the DS may reflect enhanced mineral weathering and nutrient cycling
under wet conditions. The study also highlighted that fertilizer-only
treatments maintained higher reserve K levels than treatments
involving straw, indicating the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers in
stabilizing this K pool. However, the combined use of fertilizers and
straw demonstrated a balanced approach, maintaining adequate



reserve K while improving soil organic matter, a critical factor for
long-term soil health (Witt et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2023).


4.3 K balance


The K balance analysis indicated contrasting trends among
treatments. Treatments involving straw incorporation, either alone or
in combination with reduced K fertilizer doses, exhibited positive K
balances, indicating sustainable nutrient management. In contrast,
treatments relying solely on chemical fertilizers recorded negative K
balances (Mohapatra et al., 2023), highlighting the risk of soil K
depletion under intensive farming. These findings are consistent with
earlier studies by Wihardjaka et al. (1999) and Balik et al. (2019),

emphasizing the importance of integrating organic amendments to
offset nutrient mining.

The annual K balance ranged from −140 kg ha [−][1] in the treatment
with 40 kg K₂O ha [−][1] and foliar spray to +89 kg ha [−][1] in the treatment
combining 40 kg K₂O ha [−][1] with straw. This stark contrast underscores
the critical role of straw in mitigating K losses and enhancing nutrient
recycling. The positive K balance observed with straw-based
treatments also aligns with the findings of Chivenge et al. (2020), who
reported improved nutrient cycling and soil fertility with residue
incorporation in rice systems. The rice straw also provides a substrate
to promote biodiversity through the flourishing of invertebrates that
decompose the straw, which in turn enhances nutrient cycling in
paddy soils (Schmidt et al., 2015).


4.4 Implications for sustainable nutrient
management


The results of this study have significant implications for
developing sustainable nutrient management strategies in rice-based
cropping systems. First, the findings highlight the need to integrate
inorganic and organic nutrient sources to optimize soil K dynamics
and crop productivity. While chemical fertilizers are effective in
maintaining high levels of exchangeable and reserve K, the inclusion
of straw or other organic amendments enhances soil organic matter,
improves nutrient cycling, and ensures long-term soil fertility. This
integrated approach is particularly relevant for smallholder farmers,
who face resource constraints and rely heavily on soil fertility for
sustained crop production (Adhikari et al., 2019).

Second, the study underscores the importance of considering

NE-K and reserve K in nutrient recommendations. Current fertilizer
recommendations often focus on exchangeable K, overlooking the
contributions of these less available forms. Incorporating NE-K and
reserve K into nutrient management strategies can help maintain soil
K reserves and ensure a continuous supply of K to crops, particularly
under intensive farming conditions.

Third, the seasonal variations in K dynamics observed in this study
highlight the need for season-specific nutrient management. In the DS,
strategies should focus on enhancing late-season K availability to
support the high demand during the reproductive phase. In the WS, a



more balanced approach that ensures steady K availability throughout
the growing season may be more effective. Tailoring nutrient
management practices to seasonal requirements can improve nutrient
use efficiency, reduce losses, and contribute to sustainable intensification.

Finally, the positive K balance achieved with straw-based
treatments highlights the potential of residue recycling as a costeffective and environmentally friendly alternative to chemical
fertilizers. Farmers can reduce their dependence on external inputs by
returning crop residues to the soil, lowering production costs, and
mitigating environmental impacts associated with fertilizer use.
However, the study also points to the need for appropriate
management practices, such as ensuring adequate decomposition of
straw before planting, to maximize its benefits.


4.5 Future research directions


While this study provides valuable insights, several areas warrant
further investigation. Long-term studies are needed to assess the
cumulative effects of different K management strategies on soil health,
crop productivity, and environmental sustainability. In addition, research
should explore the potential of other organic amendments, such as green
manures and composts, to enhance K dynamics and support sustainable
rice production. The interactions between K and other nutrients, such
as nitrogen and phosphorus, also merit further study to optimize
nutrient management in rice-based systems. Finally, there is a need for
socioeconomic studies to evaluate the feasibility and adoption of
integrated nutrient management practices among smallholder farmers.

## 5 Conclusion


This study highlights the pivotal role of potassium (K) management
strategies in maintaining soil K dynamics and sustaining rice productivity
in a rice–rice cropping system. Integrating inorganic fertilizers with
organic amendments, such as rice straw, emerges as a viable approach to
achieving a positive K balance while enhancing soil fertility. Chemical
fertilizers effectively maintain higher levels of exchangeable and reserve
K, supporting immediate crop uptake. Conversely, treatments
incorporating straw with reduced K fertilizer doses contribute to the

mobilization of non-exchangeable K, ensuring a steady nutrient supply
during critical growth stages. Seasonal variations in K dynamics were
evident, with the dry season showing greater depletion of soil K reserves,
necessitating targeted nutrient management to address this challenge.
Treatments combining straw and reduced K fertilizer doses demonstrated
a sustainable balance, minimizing nutrient losses and mitigating soil
degradation. These findings underscore the importance of including
non-exchangeable and reserve K in nutrient management
recommendations to ensure long-term soil health and productivity.
Adopting integrated nutrient management strategies tailored to specific
seasonal requirements can optimize nutrient use efficiency, reduce
external input dependency, and promote sustainable rice cultivation,
particularly for resource-constrained smallholder farmers. Future studies
should focus on the long-term implications of such strategies on soil and
crop health.
