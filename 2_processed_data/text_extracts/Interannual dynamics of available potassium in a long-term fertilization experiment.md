**Abstract**


Dynamics of the plant-available potassium (K) has been studied in polyfactorial long-term fertilization experiments
since 1980. The fertilization scheme includes 10 combinations of K muriate and farmyard manure application rates
(annually 0–230 kg K/ha). At medium treatment (annually 153 kg K/ha), the K balance within an 8-year crop rotation reflected crop specific K application rates with positive annual balances in years of growing silage maize and
sugar beet (high K input), and negative in two years of growing alfalfa. Available K clearly corresponded to the dynamics of the K balance, with statistically significant fluctuations from 88 to 149 mg K/kg within one crop rotation
cycle. Periodic fluctuations of available K induced by crop rotation were observed also in non-fertilized treatments.
The variability of available K contents was influenced primarily by crop plants and experimental unexplained factors; interannual weather fluctuations and field differences were of low significance. In the paper, the importance of
interannual K dynamics for the construction of correct long-term time trends is shown and discussed.

Long-term fertilization experiments provide
an opportunity for experimentation in which the
effects of manipulation may be separated from
other variables (Southwood 1994). The value
of long-term trials, even though nowadays it is
questioned, is irreplaceable – the long-term trials are the basic platform for examination and
quantification of cultivation-based changes in
agro-ecosystems and enable the evaluation of the
effects of long-term different intensity of fertilization on nutrient dynamics (Merbach and Deubel
2008). In many European countries, the oldest
long-term experiments are still being maintained
and provide essential information for agriculture
and environmental science.


In the Czech Republic, most of the long-term
field experiments had been founded and maintained
by the Crop Research Institute (CRI), Prague. The
oldest trials were established in 1955 in PragueRuzyně. The trials were maintained at twelve sites
differing in soil and climatic conditions. The main
experimental factors investigated were crop nutrition, crop rotation, cultivation technologies and
organic manuring (for an overview see Lipavský
et al. 2005).



An important question that can be answered with
the help of long-term trials is the one concerning
the long-term effects of contemporary K management. Fertilizer and manure application rates and
timing are based on the optimal nitrogen rate and
not on K requirements (Oborn et al. 2005). In addition, changes in the structure and financing of
the agronomic sector in the Czech Republic that
occurred after 1989, accompanied with continuous
increase of input costs led to a dramatic drop in
the use of K mineral fertilizers. The actual average
annual application rate is 8 kg/ha of mineral K
and 17 kg K in manures (Anonymous 2007), that
is only 15% of the application rate before 1989.
In this type of management, K balance becomes
highly negative – outputs are higher than inputs
and K is released from internal soil sources.


The issue of sustainable soil K management was
partly ignored during the last few decades while
the potential environmental impact of agricultural
use of nitrogen and phosphorus was considered a
more important problem (Simonsson et al. 2007).
From this viewpoint, trial plots with low or zero
K inputs are of special interest within long-term
K fertilization trials. They can provide essential

In this paper we evaluate selected data from
polyfactorial field experiments, established in 1980
at CRI. Until now, large datasets taken within the
experiments were only processed partially and no
comprehensive works have been published. In this
article we evaluate K inputs/outputs and plantavailable K data as a base for analysis of long-term
trends. The aim of the article is to evaluate the

dynamics of available K and discuss its importance
as related to the construction of correct time trends

in cases of timely non-regular soil sampling.


**Material and methods**


Polyfactorial field experiments were originally
established at 9 sites representing different pedo


and climasequences of the arable soils in the Czech
Republic. For each experiment, a central scheme
of the second order design in incomplete blocks
was used, according to Cochran and Cox (1957).
At each site the trial consisted of four fields, each
consisting of 56 plots of 5 × 12 m, designed in 4
rows. Within the scheme, the influence of 6 independent factors was tested. Some factors were
altered during the experiment (Table 1).

Five levels corresponding to each factor were
set up in a manner that medium level reflected
standard agricultural cropping practice, specific
for each crop-plant, and the highest level was
supposed to limit plant growth by the excess of
the nutrient (or by very high stand density). Zero
level means no use of the fertilizer, except in the
case of stand density where some low density was
chosen. Between the medium and extreme levels,
two other levels (higher, lower) were set up, of
which the ‘higher’ was supposed to be optimal or

close-to-optimal in order to satisfy crop demands
and reach maximum yield. The influence of the
factors was investigated in 8-year crop rotation
(Table 2), including 50% of cereals, potato/sugar
beet, silage maize and clover/alfalfa (depending
on the climate conditions of the site). In fields,
rotation was phased in 2-year shifts.

Within trials at given sites each field originally
consisted of 47 different treatments. 10 plots had
the same treatment with all factors at medium level.

This set of 10 equally treated plots was used for the
calculation of variability parameters because all
other treatments were not replicated within a given
field. 32 treatments had different combinations of

‘higher’ and ‘lower’ levels, 12 treatments had all
factors at medium level and always had one of the
factors at ‘zero’ or ‘excess’ level. One treatment

had all factors at zero level (i.e. ‘not treated’) and
the last treatment had all factors at zero level and
the 6 [th] factor at the ‘excess’ level. This treatment

was changed to ‘not treated’ after 1995.

This set of treatments was the same for all four

fields, which differed only in the distribution of
treatments within the field. It means that the ma
jority of treatments were replicated four times.

N fertilizers were used in the form of ammonium

nitrate or ammonium sulphate; P as super-phosphate; K as K muriate and Mg in the form of Mg
sulphate.

After harvest (except in the second year of alfalfa/clover), soil samples (consisting of 5–8 subsamples within the plot) of plough horizon (depth
of 0–20 cm) were taken and analyzed for soil reaction, organic carbon content, total nitrogen and
available nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg). Plant material



from each harvest was analyzed for total content
of N, P, K, Ca and Mg after wet combustion.

The consistency of the experiments was disturbed
by several factors, mostly connected with financial
issues following 1989. The main changes were: the
termination of 4 experimental sites, changes in
the crop rotation at some fields and a reduction
of soil sampling.

The analytical method of available K determination was also changed. The formerly used method
of ammonium acetate/oxalate extraction (according to Schachtschabel, in Hraško et al. 1962) was
replaced by Mehlich II/III extraction. In this case
data were transformed back to Schachtschabel

according to the equations below.


K Sch = 0.8187 × K M II + 3.94;


K = 0.712 × K + 9.96.
Sch M III


These equations were derived from analyses
of a large number of soil samples (based on data
published by the Central Institute for Supervising
and Testing in Agriculture, Trávník 2008). K balances were calculated as the difference between

K input (in farmyard manure and mineral K) and
K output by harvested plant material. K leaching
and atmospherical deposition were not taken into

account.


Data presented and discussed originate from
the experiment at Hněvčeves. Data from Kostelec,
Humpolec and Pernolec are shown in a lesser extent, with the aim to demonstrate the differences
among the experiments at different sites.

**Results and discussion**


K balances calculated for one crop rotation
(Table 4) correspond well with the data derived
from other fertilization experiments. Macháček
et al. (2001) reported that the annual balance in
common agricultural practice ranges from minus
75 to minus 185 kg K/ha at low or zero K inputs.
The correlation between K input and K balance
is highly significant ( _R_ _[2]_ = 0.99, _n_ = 10). Zero balance was obtained at the annual input of 163 kg
K/ha.


The scheme of the experiment allows 10 combinations of farmyard manure (FYM) and K muriate
application rates, which would theoretically give
10 different overall K application rates (marked
with letters A–J in Table 4). Some combinations
of levels give nearly the same overall K application
rates and a similar K balance. The same application
rate obtained by different combinations of FYM
and K muriate levels allows a rough comparison
of the degree of utilization of FYM and mineral K.
At low application rates (combinations B and C);
the difference between the outputs of K suggests
better utilization of K from muriate than that

from FYM. When taking into account the uptake
from fertilizer (which was calculated as K uptake
at the particular treatment minus K uptake at no
fertilized control), crops utilized 44% of mineral
fertilizer (combination C), and only 9% of K from
FYM (combination B), on average.



At higher application rates the data do not indicate that one of the potassium forms has better
utilization by crops than another. At the highest
application rates, the degree of utilization of both
FYM and mineral K (combinations G, H, I) is very
low (22–25%). Reduced effectiveness of fertilizer
K suggests that plant growth and yield formation
is limited by other nutrients (e.g. N, P and Mg;
Blake et al. 1999).

Manuring with FYM supplies soil with high inputs of organic matter and nutrients twice during
a rotation cycle (for sugar beet and silage maize).
Despite the high K demand of these crops, K input by FYM and K muriate is usually higher than
K uptake. Only exceptionally, in very favorable
weather conditions, K output by a high yield of
sugar beet may compensate for high K input. Thus,
the curve of K balance has two positive peaks in
the 4 [th] and 7 [th] year of the rotation (Figure 1) in
fertilized treatments. On the contrary, the high
K uptake of these crops in non-fertilized treatments causes a clear drop down of the balance
in these years.

The growing of alfalfa (first two years of the
rotation) causes high negative balances in all treatments regardless of the application rate. K fertilizer,
together with N and P, is used only before sowing of alfalfa and oat to stimulate plant growth.
Afterwards, alfalfa stand was not fertilized and a
large biomass export associated with several cuttings was not compensated for by any input. The

K application rate (153 kg K/ha/year) and excess K
application rate (230 kg K/ha/year). Hněvčeves, based

on 1980–1992 data


lowest balance was found in the treatments of the
highest application rate in the 2 [nd] year, suggesting
the lack of K limited the yields of alfalfa.

Further results and discussion on available K

during one crop rotation are related to data of
medium application rate (combination E), mainly
for two reasons: (1) 10 replications of this treatment within each field allow for sufficient statis
tical evaluation, and (2) we can assume that no
long-term changes of soil K are due to a nearly
zero balance.


The dynamics of the available K within crop rotation corresponds clearly to the dynamics of K balance
(Figure 2); even the amplitude of changes is not as
high. Despite quite high variability of the available K
contents, many of the between-year differences are
statistically significant. The mean for whole rotation cycle is 116 mg K/kg. The lowest contents of
available K are connected with the negative balance
in the first two years of the rotation, with minimum
content of 88 mg K/kg in the second year. Because
forage crops take up a substantial amount of K from
the subsoil (41–67%, Witter and Johansson 2001),
the decrease of available K is not as steep as can
be expected from the K balance.

Available K contents after winter wheat harvest
in the 3 [rd] year (93 mg K/kg) are not significantly
different from that in the second year and that
logically corresponds to a nearly zero balance
(–13 kg K/ha/year). The positive balance in the
4 [th] year of crop rotation (silage maize) increased

available K to 125 mg K/kg, and this increasing
trend lasted to the 5 [th] year (130 mg K/kg), despite
a slightly negative balance. The second important
increase of available K occurred after sugar beet
(year 7), where the curve of available K in the
rotation reached a maximum of 149 mg K/kg. In
the last year of the rotation, the available K contents dropped down to 116 mg/kg even though
the balance was not negative. This drop can only
be explained as K-loss to subsoil by leaching or
K fixation into non-available forms.


Annual K balances influence available K to a large
extent also at other sites. ‘Two-peak’ character of
the available K curve is a common feature of all the

experimental sites (Figure 3). Different positions
of the curve (different mean level of available K)
are connected with different nutrient status at

the beginning of experiments and probably also
with soil properties (e.g. clay content and quality,
cation exchange capacity).

Polyfactorial field experiments were designed
for analyses of the influence of defined factors and
for investigation of time trends caused by various
application rates of fertilizers. This experimental
design has limited possibilities to evaluate other influences. Even though we realize some constraints,
we made attempts to provide an evaluation of the
factors affecting available K variability.

We can distinguish three known sources of
available K variability within the experiment: (1)
variability given by the growing of different crops

(year of crop rotation), (2) variability given by interannual weather fluctuations and (3) variability
among fields for a given year of the rotation (Figure
4). The latter is supposed to be minimum; because
an important assumption of the experiment is that
there are no inner (soil, site) differences among
fields of a particular site.

Results of the main factors ‘Crop’, ‘Weather’
and ‘Field’ are shown in Table 5. All factors have

statistically significant influence on available K.
By comparing the sum of squares, it is clear that
the influence of crop factor (34% of total) on data
variability is much higher than the influence of
weather and field factors (3%). Residual unexplained variability is high (42%), pointing to the
existence of other unknown factors affecting available K data (e.g. soil, sampling and analytical variability). All factors combined explain 58% of the

data variability (including interactions of factors).
Based on this evaluation, it can be concluded that
within this trial, the growing of different crops
had a dominant influence on available K contents.

Differences among fields and interannual weather
fluctuations (which influence soil K contents e.g.
via affecting crop yields or leaching) were of much
less importance.

As for high residual variability found within this
trial, unexplained K variability seems to be common in long-term fertilization experiments. Jouany
et al. (1996) reported that for a given treatment,
differences between two successive sampling dates
are sometimes larger than differences between
treatments for a given date. Authors consider that
this variability is caused by water content at sampling and drying and subsequent release or fixation
of K. Merbach and Deubel (2007) reported data of

the Halle trials as 10-year means with the remark
that in addition to the given means, graduation
of double-lactate K in individual years existed on
different levels (± 20 mg K/kg).

Accidental incorporation of various ratios of the
subsoil into the plough layer during the ploughing may be one of the possible sources of the high
residual variability.

Influence of the interannual K dynamics within
three complete crop rotations in field 3 can be
clearly identified (Figure 5). For medium and excess
application rates, the curves had typical two-peak
character within all rotation cycles and the lowest
available K contents were always present after the
second year of alfalfa.

A very interesting phenomenon is the periodic
change of available K content in the non-fertilized
treatment. Changes follow the crop rotation cycle
but the relation to K balance is not as clear as in the

case of fertilized treatments. Generally, the balance
is more negative in the first half of the cycle than
in the second half (Figure 1), when excluding the
balance of the 7 [th] year. This corresponds to lower
K contents in the first half of the rotation cycle.
However, the balance in the year of sugar beet
cropping is even more negative than for alfalfa,
but soil K contents stay at a higher level.

This phenomenon might be connected with
the physiology of the sugar beet. It is known that
sugar beet is more effective in uptake of fixed soil
K then cereals (El Dessougi et al. 2002) and due



to a deep root system it takes large portions of K
from deeper horizons. Simultaneously, K balance
includes whole soil profile and only a portion of the
K uptake originated in a plough layer. Decreases of
the soil K pool are often found to be smaller than
the calculated total deficit of K from the cropping
systems based on the accumulated field balances
(Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007). Anyway, it is unlikely
that a crop with high K demands will not affect K
contents in plough layer. Another possible explanation may be that high contents are related to the
method of sampling. After the harvest of sugar
beet, deeper soil horizons with a higher K content
may mix with the plough (sampling) layer, consequently increasing measured K contents. Some
side transfer of more fertilized soil from adjacent
fertilized plots is also possible, even though the
agrotechnics is done carefully to minimize the
soil translocation. Thorough explanation deserves
further attention and verification of data.


In papers evaluating soil properties in long-term
experiments, the most usual ways of presenting the
time series are calculating means for some period
of years or showing values of regular sampling with
constant periodicity of several years. If sampling is
only occasional, data are collected non-regularly
and then trends have to be evaluated by comparison
of these isolated data. In the case of our data, some
of the treatments were sampled almost regularly
in periodicity of 1 or 2 years (combinations A, B,
C, E, I and J). For these data, trend evaluation is

possible by calculating a mean of average values
for whole crop rotation cycles.

The regular sampling of the other treatments was
disrupted after 1988; all plots were then sampled
again in 1995 and in 2007. This reveals evident
problems of how to compare these data and to
construct time trends. 1988 is the 7 [th] year of the
crop rotation, year 1995 is the 6 [th] and year 2007
is the 2 [nd] year of the crop rotation. The problem
of comparing data is that means of the 2 [nd], the
6 [th] and the 7 [th] year differ significantly from each
other (see Figure 2).

The direct comparison of values and calculating
time trends are therefore not correct for treat
ments with combinations of application rates
D, F, G and H, which were sampled only in the
above-mentioned years. In this case, data should
be adjusted to the same level. We decided to use
year 2007 (the 2 [nd] year of crop rotation) to recalculate values from years 1988 and 1995. We used
a ratio between average K content of the 2 [nd] and
the 6 [th] year of crop rotation (0.72) to adjust data
from year 1995 and the ratio between the 2 [nd] and
the 7 [th] year of crop rotation (0.59) to adjust data
from year 1988. For other combinations of application rates, contents in years 1983, 1991 and
1999 were taken to calculate time trends (the 2 [nd]
year of crop rotation).



Data used for the construction of time trends

and calculated slopes are shown in Table 6. For
a given combination of application rates, a slope
of the regression line was calculated from 4 time
points. Between regression trends, calculated from
adjusted and non-adjusted contents, are important
differences. Calculated slopes of time trends can
be approximately the same (combination F), but
may differ in absolute values (combination H) or
can even indicate a different direction of time

changes (combination D).

The highest slopes correspond to annual increases more than 2 mg K/kg (ca 1.5% of available
K content) and were detected for combinations H
and J. At the same time, variations caused by growing of different crops were found in the range of
88–149 mg K/kg, i.e. ± 26% of the mean. It implies
that interannual increases caused by long-term
trends are of much lower extent (order of magnitude
lower) than K variability caused by crops.

Slopes are highly correlated with K balance
(Figure 6, correlation is statistically significant
at _P_ < 0.05). From the regression equation it can
be calculated that a zero slope, i.e. a stabilized
available K level, corresponds to an average annual
K balance of minus 78 kg K/ha. It means that, for
example, at an application rate of 77 kg K and a
medium application rate of nitrogen and phospho

Annual K balance (kg K/ha) Annual K balance (kg K/ha)



Figure 6. Relationship between K balances and slopes

of time trends of available K contents. Hněvčeves site


rus (combination C), soil K will be continuously
replenished from soil sources at an annual rate
of 79 kg K/ha to keep the same level of ca. 76 mg
K/kg (in long-term view).

We would like to pinpoint one interesting consequence that arises from calculated long-term
trends. In soils of high starting available K, substantial changes in available K content at plough
layer may occur after two 8-year rotations (decrease
from ca 250 mg K/kg by 121 mg K/kg; Lauringson
et al. 2004). In the soil of Hněvčeves, which had
much lower starting available K (119 mg K/kg), the
decrease of available K in non-fertilized treatments

was not as steep (up to 65 mg K/kg in 2007) and
the available K contents stayed at approximately
the same level (48–65 mg K/kg) during the last
20 years, at an annual balance minus 122 kg K per
hectare. If we consider the average bulk density of
plough layer to be 1.3 Mg/m [3] and the thickness of
plough layer to be 25 cm, 1 mg/kg available K is then
equal to 2.5 kg K/ha. Therefore, in non-fertilized
plots, soil sources other than those extracted for
available K, release annually ca 50 mg K/kg.

As was previously mentioned, the balance covers
the whole soil profile and therefore this comparison
is not fully correct, as we did not analyze subsoil
available K contents. However, it is obvious that
available K is continuously restored. The reason
of this restoration is K mobilization from slow

release forms. K is replenished by (1) the weathering of mineral soil particles (annually 3–82 kg
K/ha depending on soil properties; Holmqvist et
al. 2003), and (2) by the release of fixed (reserve)



K pool, the content of which is in average 3-times
larger than that of available K (Fotyma 2007). Even
though we did not analyze the pool of fixed K in
the soils at Hněvčeves, we expect that the rate of
K output was high enough to cause substantial
depletion of fixed K.

Nowadays, our crop production depends highly
on the mobilization of internal soil K sources.

Negative K balance is a reality and probably also a
future aspect of our agriculture; the change of this
trend cannot be expected in the near future. The
annual K application rate should increase manifold
(to level ca 170 kg K/ha) to reach stabilization of
available K. Moreover, prices of K fertilizers are
increasing, contrary to prices of agricultural products. Farmers will not be motivated to use K fer
tilizers until soil sources are exhausted. Attention

should be therefore focused on the extent of these

sources and the sustainability of their continuous
exploitation. Understanding and quantifying K
mobilization processes is one of the important
challenges for future research.

Observed interannual dynamics of soil K are driven by agricultural management and of course are
specific for a particular type of that management,
crops in rotation, fertilization practices, and soil
and site properties. The crop rotation used in our
trial is probably more K-demanding than the others.
However, results have important consequences for
evaluation of long-term data not only from these
static fertilization experiments, but also for data taken
within large (national) soil monitoring programs.
In occasionally sampled sites or when the period of
sampling is several years, agricultural management
has to be inevitably known. Otherwise, construction
of time trends will be strongly affected by short-term
influences. The impact of the management could
inadvertently cover up long term trends and finally,
the results would not reflect real time trends.

Within the long term polyfactorial fertilization
experiments, periodic interannual fluctuations
of available K were observed, with statistically
significant differences from 88 to 149 mg K/kg
within one crop rotation cycle. These fluctuations
were driven by the dynamics of the K balance that
originated mainly in crop-specific K inputs. The
variability of soil-K contents was primarily influenced by crop plants and experimental unexplained
factors; interannual weather fluctuations and field
differences were of low significance.
