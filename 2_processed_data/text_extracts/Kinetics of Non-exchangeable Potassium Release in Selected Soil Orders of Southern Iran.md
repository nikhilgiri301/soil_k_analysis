Zareian G., Farpoor M.H., Hejazi-Mehrizi M., Jafari A. (2018): Kinetics of non-exchangeable potassium release in
selected soil orders of southern Iran. Soil & Water Res., 13: 200−207.


Non-exchangeable K release can greatly influence soil K fertility. This study was carried out to study the release
of non-exchangeable K from 22 surface and subsurface soils of southern Iran using successive extraction with
10 mmol/l of CaCl 2 and oxalic acid in a period of 2−1368 h at 25 ± 1°C. Alfisols, Aridisols, Entisols, Inceptisols,
Mollisols, and Histosols were among the studied soil orders. Illite, smectite, chlorite, vermiculite, kaolinite and
palygorskite clay minerals were identified. The amount of non-exchangeable K varied from 95 to 506 mg/kg. Re­
sults showed that CaCl 2 and oxalic acid released 60 and 55% of non-exchangeable K from soils, respectively. The
discontinuity in slope was found when the cumulative amount of released K was plotted versus time, supporting
the multi-reactive nature of K exchange sites. The cumulative K release in soils ranged from 87 to 300 mg/kg for
CaCl 2 and 78 to 300 mg/kg for oxalic acid which was well described by simplified Elovich and power function
equations. The _b_ constant of simplified Elovich as an index of non-exchangeable K release rate was in the range of
10 to 36 mg/kg for CaCl 2 and 11 to 36 mg/kg for oxalic acid. The highest _b_ constant was measured in Inceptisols
and Alfisols, while the lowest values were found in Entisols and Histosols. In conclusion, the K release pattern was
similar for both extractants and affected by clay content and type, and soil depth.

Potassium, as the seventh most frequent element
of the Earth crust (2.6% of weight), is an essential
nutrient for humans, animals, and plants. Soil potas­
sium could be divided into soluble, exchangeable,
non-exchangeable, and structural forms. The major
proportion of soil potassium is structural (90–98%),
whereas soluble and exchangeable (0.1–2%) and nonexchangeable potassium (2–10%) constitute only
a small portion of total soil K. Non-exchangeable
K is released to exchangeable forms to meet plant
needs of potassium (Sparks & Huang 1985). Mar­
tin and Sparks (1983) suggested that the release
of K from non-exchangeable to exchangeable form
could be limited when the concentration of K in the

soil solution exceeds 1 mmol/l. Wang _et al_ . (2011)


**200**



showed that the critical level of soluble K for the

release of non-exchangeable K could be related to
the type of clay minerals and content of Ca [2+] and
Na [+] in the soil solution. Jalali (2006) stated that
the calcareous soils of Iran containing sufficient
exchangeable K and K-bearing minerals are capable
of releasing sufficient K for optimal plant produc­
tion. However, exchangeable K is not always a reli­
able estimation of plant availability of potassium in
calcareous soils. The interaction of soil mineralogy,
textural characteristics, and biological processes
may influence the release of potassium in different
soil orders (Simonsson _et al_ . 2007). Therefore, the
research on the rate of non-exchangeable K release
seems necessary in such soils.

Several equations including zero order, first order,
Elovich, parabolic diffusion, and power function have
been used to describe the kinetics of non-exchange­
able K release and to evaluate soil K availability for
plant growth (Srinivasarao _et al_ . 2006; Wang _et_
_al_ . 2011). Jalali and Khanlari (2014) described the

K release from some calcareous soils of western Iran

using Elovich, parabolic diffusion and power function
equations. Hosseinpur and Motaghian (2013)
studied the release of non-exchangeable K from 10 cal­
careous soils of central Iran using 10 mmol/l CaCl 2 .
They reported that the release of non-exchangeable
K was well described by parabolic diffusion, power
function and simplified Elovich. The _b_ constant of
kinetic equations clearly showed the release rate of
non-exchangeable K and its availability.

Many crops, especially deep-rooted crops, can
obtain a substantial amount of K from lower layers
of soils, but the release of non-exchangeable K in
subsoil samples has been investigated to a lesser
extent. We hypothesized that soil physicochemical
properties and clay mineralogy are quite different
in various soil orders and soil depths, which in turn
affect the release of non-exchangeable K related to
soil classification. Data about non-exchangeable K
content and its release related to clay minerals and
soil development are highly valuable for fertility man­
agement of soils. However, limited data are available
for soils of southern Iran. The aims of the present
research were to study: (1) the non-exchangeable K
release rate in 22 surface and subsurface soils with

different clay mineralogy and soil properties using
CaCl 2 and oxalic acid extractants, and (2) the rela­



tionship between K release rate and selected phys­
icochemical properties and clay mineralogy of soils.


**MATERIAL AND METHODS**


**Study area and sampling of soils** . The study area
is located in Fars Province, southern Iran (Figure 1).
The mean annual temperature and precipitation were
17°C and 339 mm, respectively. The area was clas­
sified as semi-arid region with xeric moisture and
thermic temperature regimes. Forty pedons were
studied and eleven representative pedons (Figure 1)
were selected for physicochemical, morphological,
and clay mineralogical studies.

**Physicochemical properties** . Particle size distri­
bution was identified using a hydrometer (Gee &
Bauder 1986). Calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE)
was determined by the acid dissolution (Loeppert
& Suarez 1996). The method of Nelson and Som­
mers (1982) was used for organic matter measure­
ment. Cation exchange capacity was investigated by
1 mol/l NaOAc, pH 8.2 (Chapman 1965) and HNO 3
extractable K (as total K) was determined with boiling
nitric acid 1 mol/l (Pratt 1965) and extractable K
was determined with NH 4 OAc (Mc Lean & Watson
1985). Non-exchangeable K content was calculated
with the following formula:


Non _-_ exchangeable K = HNO 3 extractable K –

NH OAc extractable K
4


**Clay mineralogy** . Clay mineralogy was performed
on the first and second horizon (total of 22 samples)
of each pedon (Kittrick & Hope 1963; Jackson

bagh Plain

1975). A 1130 X-ray diffractometer (Philips, Netherlands) with Cu Kα target under 40 kV and 30 mA was
used for the analysis. Semi-quantitative estimation
of clay minerals was performed by comparing the
area under each diffractogram in Mg-saturated slide
treated with ethylene glycol (Johns _et al_ . 1954).

**K-release kinetics** . Soluble and exchangeable K
was first removed from soil samples using 1 mol/l
CaCl 2 for 24 h followed by the centrifugation of
suspensions. Excess Cl was removed by water and
alcohol (Martin & Sparks 1983). Subsequently,
2 g soil samples in 3 replicates were transferred
into centrifuge tubes in two sets containing 20 ml of
10 mmol/l of CaCl 2 and oxalic acid solutions. Samples
were equilibrated for 2, 4, 8, 14, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96,
120, 168, 192, 360, 528, 696, 864, 1200, and 1368 h
at 25 ± 1°C. After each period, the supernatant was
separated and a new portion of extractant was added,
shaken, and centrifuged. The K concentration was
measured in the supernatant by a flame photometer
(Model PFP7, Jenway, UK). The cumulative release
of non-exchangeable K with time was fitted to the
simplified Elovich equation:


_Y_ = _a_ + _b_ ln _t_


parabolic diffusion equation:


_Y_ = _a_ + _b_ _t_ [1/2]


and power function equation:


ln _Y_ = ln _a_ + _b_ ln _t_


where:

_Y_ – quantity of K released (mg/kg) at time _t_
_a_, _b_ – constants


The above equations were tested using the _R_ [2] analy­
sis and standard error of the estimate by


SE = [∑ ( _Y_ – _Y_ *) [2] /( _n_ – 2)] [1/2]


where:

_Y_ - – calculated content of K released at time _t_

_n_ – data number


**Statistical analyses** . Statistical analyses were per­
formed using SPSS software package (Ver. 23, 2016).
The means were compared using Duncan’s test at
_P_ < 0.05. Linear regression procedure was used to
describe the kinetic equations of non-exchangeable
K release. The correlation between K release char­

acteristics and selected soil chemical and physical
properties was calculated using Pearson’s test.

**RESULTS**


Soils of Gharebagh Plain were classified as Enti­
sols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Histosols, Aridisols, and
Alfisols (Table 1).

Results of the study showed that the pH of soils
ranged from 7.1 to 8.3, EC ranged from 0.8 to 32 mS/cm
and the CaCO 3 content ranged from 32 to 8%. The
minimum (0.1%) and the maximum (21%) contents
of organic carbon were measured in Aridisols and
Histosols, respectively. The CEC ranged from 72 in
Entisols to 578 mmol(+)/kg in Histosols (Table 2).

The semi-quantitative clay mineralogy in the area
is shown in Table 1. The trend of palygorskite < kao­
linite < vermiculite < chlorite < smectite < illite was

observed for clay mineral content. Palygorskite was
found only in saline soils, but other clay minerals
were detected in all studied soils. The relative quanti­

ties of inherited vermiculite, chlorite, and kaolinite

were similar in all of the soils. On the other hand,
both pedogenic and inherited sources for illite and
smectite could be plausible.

**Non-exchangeable K release** . The overall results
showed that the studied soils contained large amounts
of non-exchangeable K except Histosols (pedon 5)
and subsoil layer of Entisols (pedon 1). The maximum
content of non-exchangeable K (506 mg/kg soil) was
found in the surface layer of Inceptisols having ver­
tic properties (pedon 2) with a high amount of clay
(41%) and relatively low calcium carbonate (37%),
whereas the minimum content (95 mg/kg soil) was



measured in the subsoil of Entisols (pedon 1) with
low clay (10%) and high calcium carbonate contents
(88%) (Table 3). The release of non-exchangeable K
by both the extractants was higher in surface soil
compared to subsurface soil (Table 4). CaCl 2 and
oxalic acid released more K in surface soils compared
to subsurface soils (22 and 28%, respectively) from
non-exchangeable positions (Table 4).

Time-dependent cumulative K released from soils
using CaCl 2 and oxalic acid is plotted in Figure 2.
The trend of the cumulative K release pattern was
non-linear and almost similar by the two extractants.
The K release pattern was characterized by an initial

fast reaction (2–192 h), followed by a slow reaction
(192–1368 h) showing different mechanisms control­
ling the K release process.

The cumulative content of non-exchangeable K
release after 1368 h using CaCl 2 and oxalic acid
(Table 3) showed that CaCl 2 released more nonexchangeable K than oxalic acid. The percentages
of non-exchangeable K release which are defined as

[(cumulative K released ×100)/(non-exchangeable K
content)] were 60 and 55% for CaCl 2 and oxalic acid,
respectively (Table 3).

The maximum percentages of non-exchangeable
K release were measured in the subsurface horizon

of Entisols (pedon 1) which were 91 and 82% using
CaCl 2 and oxalic acid, respectively. The minimum
percentages of non-exchangeable K release were found



in the subsoil of Inceptisols (40 and 50%), when oxalic
acid and CaCl 2 were used as extractants (Table 3).

The surface soils showed greater cumulative re­
leased K compared to subsurface samples. The mean
contents of released K by CaCl 2 in surface and sub­
surface samples were different (226 and 183 mg/kg,
respectively). The amounts of K released from surface
and subsurface samples by oxalic acid were measured
as 210 and 164 mg/kg, respectively (Table 4).

**Modelling of non-exchangeable K release** . Differ­
ent mathematical models were tested to describe the

kinetics of non-exchangeable K release for CaCl 2 and
oxalic acid extractants over 1368 h. The coefficient
of determination ( _R_ [2] ) and standard error (SE) values
showed that the three equations used in the study
could be fitted well to the K release data. Simplified

**DISCUSSION**


Despite the high total K content, low availability
of K in many soils has been frequently reported.
Potassium in soil is divided into soluble, exchange­
able, non-exchangeable and structural forms. Plant
uptake and leaching have been known to deplete
soluble and exchangeable K. In such conditions,
non-exchangeable K, which is less available to plants,
could gradually be released to readily available (solu­
ble and exchangeable K) forms (Najafi-Ghiri _et_
_al_ . 2010). The maximum K release was observed in
the surface horizon of Inceptisols (Table 3), due to
the presence of vertic properties (pedon 2) caused
by illite and higher content of non-exchangeable K
(Tables 1 and 3). On the other hand, the minimum

K release was measured in the subsurface horizon

of an Entisol with low clay and high calcium car­



bonate contents. Supporting this conclusion, the
positive correlation was found between clay content
( _r_ = 0.67** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = 0.64** for oxalic acid)
and K release. In contrast, the non-exchangeable
K release was negatively correlated with CaCO 3 con­
tent ( _r_ =–0.81** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = –0.78** for oxalic
acid), probably due to its dilution effect. The effects
of clay type, clay content and non-exchangeable K
content on K release were also reported by other
researchers (Ajiboye & Ogunwale 2008; NajafiGhiri _et al_ . 2012).

The contents of non-exchangeable K and cumula­
tive release of non-exchangeable K in surface soils
were significantly higher than in subsurface soils,
which could be due to the higher content of illite
and lower CaCO content in surface soil. The illite
3
content of surface soil was higher than in subsurface
soil (Table 4). The higher illite content on the surface
could be attributed to addition of K fertilizers and

transformation of smectite to illite together with

A higher amount of CaCO 3 and its dilution effect may
also be responsible for the lower non-exchangeable
K release in subsurface soil compared to surface soil.

The curves of non-exchangeable K release con­
sisted of two phases; an initial fast release phase
followed by a slow release phase (Figure 2). The two
phases of K release from soils were also reported by
Srinivasarao _et al_ . (2006). Hosseinpur _et al_ . (2012)
stated that the initial fast release of K may be due to
the release of K from peripheral edge sites whereas
the subsequent slower reaction represented the K re­
lease from interlayer sites. Potassium ions could be
replaced from edge and planar sites of clay minerals
by Ca [2+] but, due to high ionic radius and hydration
energy, Ca [2+] is not capable of replacing interlayer K.
The interlayer K could gradually be released with
time. Exudation of organic acids from roots into soil
may increase K availability. Oxalic acid is a com­
mon organic acid identified in the rhizosphere of
calcicole plants (Rengel & Damon 2008). The acid
can destroy the soil K minerals such as muscovite,
biotite, and k-feldspars resulting in the release of K
from non-exchangeable forms. However, the release
of K by oxalic acid was lower than that by CaCl 2 . The
lower released K content by oxalic acid might be due
to high pH and CaCO 3 content of the studied soils
(Table 3). The soils used in the present study were
calcareous, containing more than 30% of CaCO 3 and
pH > 7.2. Oxalic acid has two H [+] which are dissoci­
ated at pH > 4.5. Thus, the two free negative charges
could complexate with cations such as K, Ca, and Na.
Unlike malate and citrate, oxalate has a great ability to
chelate with Ca and oxalic acid is largely precipitated
as Ca-oxalate and thereby a low content of K may be
released (Tu _et al_ . 2007; Wani 2012).

The _b_ constant of the power function equation
was measured less than 1 in studied soils showing
a decrease in the K release with time (Table 5). It is

well documented that the _b_ constant from the Elovich

equation can be used as an index of K release rate
(Hosseinpur & Motaghian 2013). The positive cor­
relation was found between cumulative K released by
CaCl 2 ( _r_ = 0.97**) and oxalic acid ( _r_ = 0.98**) with clay
content. Also, _b_ from Elovich was positively correlated
with cumulative K release by CaCl 2 ( _r_ = 0.61**) and
oxalic acid ( _r_ = 0.65**). In contrast, the _b_ parameter
constant from Elovich was negatively correlated with
CaCO 3 content ( _r_ = –0.77** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = –0.72**
for oxalic acid). Hosseinpur _et al_ . (2012) stated that
different _b_ constants could clearly reflect different
K release power of their studied soils.


**206**



Comparison of the _b_ constant between oxalic acid
and CaCl showed a similar effect of the extractants
2
on releasing K from non-exchangeable positions
(Table 5). The clay mineral composition of studied
soils was almost similar, but illite seems to control

the K release rate of the soils. Our results indicated

that the _b_ constant was high in surface layers of In­
ceptisols and Alfisols with high clay and illite contents
(pedons 2 and 8), whereas the lowest _b_ constant was
found in the subsurface horizons of Entisols (pedon 1)
and Histosols (pedon 5). The high _b_ constant in
pedons 2 and 8 might be attributed to the expand­
able nature of illite which permits K to be released
from the edges and wedge areas (Srinivasarao _et_
_al_ . 2006). The high content of non-exchangeable K
in pedons 2 and 8 may also be responsible for the
high _b_ constant in these soils (Table 3).


**CONCLUSIONS**


This study highlighted the relationship between
non-exchangeable K release and soil classification,
clay mineralogy and soil depth in semi-arid regions
of Fars Province **.** The results showed that soil order,
soil depth, and clay type play a significant role in
non-exchangeable K content and K release rate. The
lowest contents of non-exchangeable K and K release
rate were found in subsurface layers of Entisols with
high CaCO 3 and low clay contents (pedon 1); while,
the highest values were found in Inceptisols with low
CaCO 3 and high clay contents, dominated by illite.
Results also indicated that the studied soils con­

tained large amounts of non-exchangeable K which
could be released to accessible forms. However, the
amount of this reservoir has been depleted due to
development of irrigated production systems, thus
further application of K fertilizer seems necessary
in the early future.
