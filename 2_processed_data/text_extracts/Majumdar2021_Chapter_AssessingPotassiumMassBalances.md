Abstract Estimating nutrient mass balances using information on nutrient additions
and removals generates useful, practical information on the nutrient status of a soil or

–
area. A negative input output balance of nutrients in the soil results when the crop
nutrient removal and nutrient losses to other sinks become higher than the nutrient

–
inputs into the system. Potassium (K) input output balance varies among regions
that have different climates, soil types, cropping systems, and cropping intensity.
This chapter illustrates the farm-gate K balances in major production areas of the
world and their impacts on native K fertility and crop yields. On-farm and on-station
research examples show significant negative K balances in South Asia and
Sub-Saharan Africa, while China, the USA, Brazil, and countries of the Latin
America Southern Cone highlighted continued requirement of location-specific K
application to maintain crop yields and soil K fertility status at optimum levels.


11.1 Concepts of Soil Nutrient Balance


Soil nutrient balance is an account of the total inputs and outputs of a particular
nutrient in an agroecosystem (NAL 2020). Soil nutrient balance is the principle of
mass balance applied to crop nutrients. Mass balance accounts for the matter
entering, present in, and leaving a system. Öborn et al. (2003) separated soil nutrient
balances into three categories: farm-gate, field, and farm-system budgets. These
types of balances compare nutrient imports to nutrient exports. Farm-gate balances
are not limited to farms but can be calculated at a variety of scales, depending on the
data available. In this chapter, we focus on K farm-gate balances at the state/province
and national levels across major production areas of the world.


11.1.1 Potassium Removal and Use for Different Cropping
Systems and Geopolitical Boundaries


Because of its economic and environmental importance, there is increasing interest
in developing ways to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of fertilizer use on
farms, as well as at regional and national scales. Partial nutrient balance (PNB) is,
for a given nutrient, the sum of outputs divided by the sum of inputs (Table 11.1).
Partial factor productivity (PFP) is, for a given nutrient, biomass yield divided by
the sum of inputs. Both can provide some guidance on system-level efficiency
relative to nutrient use. These two metrics have been used to describe system
performance in relation to nutrient use at continental (Ladha et al. 2003), national
(Lassaletta et al. 2014), regional (Edis et al. 2012), and at farm-gate (Gourley et al.
2012) scales, and by industry (McLaughlin et al. 1992). Although trends in N and P
use have been presented (Zhang et al. 2015; Lassaletta et al. 2014), there are few
reports of these trends for K other than Fixen et al. (2015). This chapter seeks to

the removal and use of K within farming systems.


11.1.2 Metrics for Nutrient Use Efficiency


Nutrient use efficiency (NUE) is an evaluation of crop performance based on the
quantity of a given nutrient input. Nutrient use efficiency is a broad term and is
quantified in various ways by various metrics. Table 11.1 shows a selection of
nutrient use efficiency terms and their definitions. Partial nutrient balance and PFP
have already been discussed. Partial nutrient balance intensity (PNBI) is, for a
given nutrient, the sum of inputs minus the sum of outputs on an area basis. Where
data or estimates exist, outputs and inputs can include all of those in the K cycle
[(Fig. 1.2, Chap. 1). Agronomic efficiency (AE) is, for a given nutrient, the increase](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_1)
in biomass yield divided by the associated sum of inputs. Positive returns to fertilizer
investments are indicated when AE is greater than the ratio of fertilizer price to crop
price. Recovery efficiency (RE) is, for a given nutrient, the increase in uptake
divided by the associated sum of inputs. Recovery efficiency ranges from 0 to 1, with
1 interpreted as complete uptake of all of the nutrients applied. Of these metrics,
PNB and PNBI are most often used to evaluate soil nutrient balances.
At the field, farm, or region scale, PNB K and PNBI K are often calculated using
only harvested plant K and fertilizer K (inorganic and organic). Calculating PNB K


286 K. Majumdar et al.


and PNBI K with just these data is widely performed, but only indicates the fate of
harvest nutrients and does not consider other transfer or retention fates. Partial

nutrient balance has been recommended by the International Fertilizer Association
(IFA 2020), the EU Nitrogen Expert Panel (2015), and the Global Partnership on
Nutrient Management (Norton et al. 2015) as the most appropriate measure of
nutrient use efficiency because data are generally available at farm and national
levels from which it can be calculated.

In the context of K, when the sum of K outputs equals the sum of K inputs,
PNB K ¼ 1 and PNBI K ¼ 0. When more K is added than removed, PNB K < 1 and
PNBI K - 0 (positive). The nutrient not removed can either be stored in the soil
and/or flow through to the environment. When more K is removed than supplied,
PNB K - 1 and PNBI K < 0 (negative), indicating that the soil is being depleted of K,
lowering soil fertility. The extent to which this depletion can continue without
affecting yield depends on the level of soil reserves as well as the rate at which K
becomes plant available.
Partial nutrient balance does not describe pathways of internal K transformation
within a system (e.g., K dissolution or fixation in soils). It is not necessarily a direct
quantitative estimate of K loss from the system, because K not removed in the
harvest might remain on site in the soil. Over the long term, however, changes in soil
K stocks are usually small relative to inputs and outputs, and therefore, low PNB K
values over multiple years are reasonably reliable indirect indicators of K depletion.
The selection of NUE indicators should be considered in the light of the purpose
of the undertaking. An indicator may be used by growers at field scale or as a

—
statement of accountability at a regional and/or industry scale. The two reasons

—
while not mutually exclusive do require clarity of purpose and transparency of data
used to derive them. None of the indicators reference soil health or soil nutrient

concentrations, so they are incomplete in their description of sustainability impacts.
Because marginal nutrient use declines as the nutrient is supplied, the highest values
of many indicators occur at the lowest level of application which is also likely the
lowest yield. More discussion on selecting appropriate nutrient performance indicators can be found in Fixen et al. (2015) and Norton et al. (2015).


11.1.3 Uncertainties in Estimating Nutrient Balances


Nutrient balances provide perspective on the extent of nutrient sources relative to
crop demand and may be helpful in identifying opportunities to improve nutrient use
efficiency. However, unlike a financial balance sheet, nutrient balances involve
considerable uncertainty, particularly at regional and national scales. These uncertainties derive from regional variations in crop K concentration, inadequate information on nutrient removal by some crops, lack of information on the contribution of
manure, inability to account for nutrient loss by runoff and erosion, poor fertilizer
use data, and other factors. Because of these sources of error, at best, nutrient balance
is only a partial balance (Roberts and Majumdar 2017).


11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 287


Deriving these ratios relies on reliable data on crop production (e.g., FAOSTAT),
fertilizer use (e.g., IFA industry statistics), and crop product nutrient density (e.g.,
FAOSTAT). While of interest at a general level, the data do not provide information
that can be used for system improvement and is just a reporting method. The metrics
are more an assessment of the inherent K fertility of the system, the type of crop
produced, and the farming system employed.
While production quantities are reasonably well known, the amount of grain
retained on-farm for seed, animal feed, or domestic use is not often included. Also,
the area of crop production could be the areas of the country, of agriculture, of arable
farming, the area sown, fertilized, or harvested. The nutrient concentration of
manures and organic supplements included in the budget approach is quite variable.
For example, the sugar industry in Australia has an apparent high PNB K because
calculations do not often include K-rich by-products from sugar mills that are
recycled back onto cane fields.
A second aspect of the uncertainties is the concentration of the nutrient in the
product removed as well as in nutrient inputs. For example, Norton (2012) reported
that K concentrations in wheat grain varied by �14% of the mean value for dry grain
of 4606 mg K kg [–][1] . As a consequence, any PNB K or PFP K is likely to have a
10–15% error embedded in the data used to derive the metric.

Thirdly, there are few reliable data sets on the use of fertilizers on different crops,
and the best current data at the national level was reported by Heffer (2013),
although regional agricultural and resource management groups may also hold
similar data from farm surveys, various agricultural agencies, or the fertilizer
industry. Even so, not many sources disaggregate the data to fertilizer use by
production region and crop, which is really the detail required for growers and
advisors to make system-level improvements.
Finally, a single fertilizer application may carry through to a second and often

–
different crop, such as in a maize soybean rotation. The residual nutrient carryover
and then removal by the second crop is not accounted for, similar to not taking
account of K released from soil minerals in the balance calculations.

The critical aspects of developing these metrics are to ensure that the data are
transparent, auditable, referenced, consider all nutrient sources, and are regionally
relevant and appropriate to the intention as to how the metrics are to be interpreted.


11.1.4 Interpreting Nutrient Balance Information


The first and most significant issue to consider when interpreting a nutrient metric is
the degree of limitation that the particular nutrient imposes on the system studied. If
the nutrient is not limiting crop growth due to high soil reserves or other biotic or
abiotic influences, then the value of PNB K and PFP K will be high, as little K fertilizer
is applied relative to yield and nutrient removal. This can give an unrealistic
impression of the potential returns on K investment from the PFP K value and an
over-assessment of the degree of soil depletion occurring from PNB K . In such cases,


288 K. Majumdar et al.


PNBI K may be a more accurate indicator of soil depletion since it is an extensive or
area-based rather than intensive metric.

Where K is the most limiting nutrient, over the long term and within the bounds of
errors associated with the data, it is desirable for PNB K to approach unity, so that
input and output are balanced. When PNB K < 0.5, there is probably an opportunity
for using evidence-based nutrient management principles to improve efficiency. At
the other extreme, when PNB K - 1.0, it is likely that efficiency cannot be improved
further without risking the depletion of soil supply. However, this should not imply
that PNB K values between 0.5 and 1.0 are necessarily acceptable, because, as
already noted, a PNB K value of, say 0.7, maybe good for some systems in some
places and not so good for other systems in other places.
While mean values are useful, downscaled nutrient performance indicators from
dairy farms (Gourley et al. 2012) and grain farms (Norton 2017) are highly variable
and generally skewed. While the distribution of these values can be informative for
growers as benchmarks for nutrient performance in a participatory research setting,
valid comparisons can only be made among similar systems.
Trends in efficiency metrics can be viewed in a broader background against
economic development in general. An economic Kuznets curve (Kuznets 1955)
identifies that as an economy develops, resource-use metrics like PNB initially
indicate unsustainability (such as PNB >> 1) as resources are exploited, but then
resource use becomes more sustainable as inputs become economic. So nutrient
PNBs are likely to reflect the stage of economic development and agricultural
industrialization as well as production systems management.


11.2 Australia


In Australia, grazing land accounts for 87% of agricultural land use, with 16% of
land under improved pastures. Around 50 M ha is used for crop production, with less
than 5% irrigated. Farmers produce around 40 Mt of grains annually, with wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.) (24 Mt) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (7 Mt) as the main
grains. Sugarcane (Saccharum giganteum (Walter) Pers.), cotton (Gossypium
hirsutum L.), and viticulture are worth a total of around $4.2 billion annually,
while other horticultural crops add another $8 billion. The Australian beef, sheep,
and dairy industries are largely pasture-based, and the gross value of slaughtering is
over $7.3 billion, while dairy products ($4.7 billion) and wool ($2.6 billion) are also
significant industries. Grain and red meat production are highly variable due to
seasonal conditions, and growers are careful with the allocation of production
resources (ABARES 2016).
All the K fertilizer used in Australia is imported, and the annual peak quantity of
imported KCl was ~480 kt 2004/2007, equivalent to ~239 kt K, assuming KCl
averaged 60% K 2 O. The annual peak of K 2 SO 4 imports was 60 kt in 2012, or
25 kt K, calculated using a 50% K 2 O concentration for K 2 SO 4 . Long-term K use has
been ~170 kt of K, but during the “Millennium Drought” total K fertilizer use

declined to a low of 134 kt K in 2009, but has since recovered to 227 kt K according
to the 2016–2017 report from Fertilizer Australia (Drew 2018). This amount makes
up less than 1% of the global K used.
Using the agricultural production and fertilizer use data, PNB K can be calculated
at national and regional scales, with regional fertilizer use data derived from farm
surveys (ABS 2016). In aggregate, the national PNB K was 2.9 for the audited period,
and PNBI K was –0.6 kg K ha [–][1], with the denominator used as the area of land used
for agricultural production. These values are consistent with the National Land and
Water Resources Audit (2001) which reported that K use was around one-third of the
amount of K removed.

The patterns across different Australian resource management regions for two
audit periods are shown in Fig. 11.1. The distribution of the balances largely reflects
the balance of enterprises within each region, as well as the inherent K fertility of the

soils. In essence, the areas where K was in the largest deficit were in the sugargrowing areas in Queensland and the lower rainfall grain-growing regions of
Western Australia, South Australia, and Central Queensland. It should be noted
that the data used to generate these maps did not include any recycled materials such
as mill wastes from sugar processing or manures used as inputs into crop production.
Edis et al. (2012) used farm survey data that included fertilizer inputs estimated
for each industry to disaggregate PNB K and PNBI K by commodity. These data are
summarized in Table 11.2, which shows that all industries except cotton have more
K removed than applied as fertilizer. Cotton is usually grown in rotation with other
annual crops so the true K balance is confounded by fertilizer practices on those
other crops. There is much less K applied than is removed and the largest apparent
deficits are in the grains, sugar, and dairy industries. Recycled K-rich mill wastes are
not included for the sugar industry, and PNB K and PNBI K for the dairy industry do
not include K supplied to pastures that is ultimately derived from feeds purchased
from outside the farm-gate. Gourley et al. (2012) reported that K from cattle feed
averaged 25 kg K ha [–][1] compared to a fertilizer input of 32 kg K ha [–][1] from data
collected on 44 dairy farms across Australia, so that total K input in this industry may
be underestimated.


11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 291


While it may be of interest to compare industries or regions, there are important
limitations in the data presented in both Fig. 11.1 and Table 11.2. The survey sample
sizes are small which leads to up-scaling errors, and in these data, the up-scaled
national K use is about 65% of the fertilizer industry-reported consumption. Underreporting of K use in these farm surveys is likely a consequence of imprecise survey
questions that, for example, do not discriminate fertilizer product application rate
from nutrient rate. Regional differences in product nutrient density, rotations used,
and the extent of the use of recycled matter all make the actual values imprecise and
of limited value in drawing conclusions about the efficiency of different production

systems.
However, the major significant deficiency in these types of regional or industrybased data is that averages provide little or no intelligence to growers on their farmlevel balances. The data collected by Gourley et al. (2012) for the dairy industry and
Norton and vanderMark (2016) for the grains industry gives error terms around the
inputs, as well as the derived metrics concerning nutrient use efficiency.


11.2.1 Southern Australian Grain Farms


While regional performance indicators are of interest in a policy sense, the collection
and collation of nutrient removal and use at farm or field levels are more important to
growers, as these data inform them about how their specific management practices
have built up or depleted nutrients over time. Such an understanding will help them
make decisions about appropriate interventions to address any imbalances.
Norton (2017) reported nutrient performance indicators from a survey of
474 fields (34,900 ha) between 2010 and 2014 in south-eastern Australia. Nutrient
balances (nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P], K, and sulfur [S]) for each field over the
audit period were estimated from fertilizer use, stubble management (burned,
removed, grazed), and crop yield. Grain and hay yields were recorded in the farm
records, and regional wheat grain nutrient concentrations for wheat (Norton 2012)
and canola (Brassica napus L.) (Norton 2014a) were used to estimate removal in
grains. Other values were derived from the values used in the NLWA (2001). The
summary presented here is for the K balances alone.
Even though 20% of surveyed fields received K fertilizer, with an average K
application rate of <10 kg K ha [–][1] year [–][1], where K fertilizer was used, the application
rates were about 90 kg K ha [–][1] on canola and 66 kg K ha [–][1] on cereals. On the fields
where K was applied, PNB K and PFP K were calculated with the median PNB K of
3.0, and only seven of the fields surveyed showed more K use than removal over the
audit period. Even where K was used, 12 fields had PNB K - 5 (Fig. 11.2a). The
PFP K values where K was used had a median of 350 kg grain kg [–][1] K (Fig. 11.2b).
The low use of K in eastern Australia in particular can be explained by the
generally high soil test K values, indicating that supplementary K was not required.

assess the proportion of areas where a response to K was likely based on the soil test

critical values (Brennan and Bell 2013). In the south-eastern grain-producing areas,
soil K concentrations are generally higher in the lower rainfall areas, but there are
regions in the higher rainfall zones near the coast where yield responses to added K
are likely. About half the K soil test values on sand and loam soil types in
southwestern Victoria are low and these are coincident with the areas where K

fertilizer was reported to be applied from the farm survey (Christy et al. 2015). In
particular, low soil K concentrations were seen on lighter acid soils under high
rainfall conditions and also in formed-in-place Vertosols in both Victoria and
Queensland.


11.2.2 Trends in Potassium Removal


Similar to the high PNB K values reported in the NLWA (2001), Bell and Moody
(2005) reported consistently negative K budgets for grain farms in the northern
cropping region of Australia. The extent of the deficit was linked to regional crop


11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 293


productivity and the low use of K fertilizer. Potassium removal was highest in
chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crops because of the higher than average grain K
concentrations in chickpeas being consistently higher yielding than crops like
sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Typically, K removals were between
8 and 20 kg K ha [–][1] year [–][1] over a five-crop sequence. They also reported low and
declining soil K concentrations in many of the summer cropping regions in Queensland. Soil test K values showed stratification with around 1.6–3.2 times more
exchangeable K in the topsoil than the subsoil. This depletion has largely gone

–
undetected by soil tests which generally represent only the 0 10 cm topsoil. There
are now research projects investigating deep placement of K (and P) as a means of
alleviating this deficiency.
There is concern about this depletion trend more widely in regions where K
fertilizer has not been traditionally used. Key factors indicating a future K response
are cropping on soils that have low to moderate exchangeable and non-exchangeable
K reserves, and where K removal in harvested grain and hay is high. Indeed, the
consistently low grain K concentrations in some areas coupled with some very low K
usage suggested that the soil K status may be approaching low levels—whether due
to stratification, presence of high sodium (Na), or the lack of substantial
non-exchangeable K reserves.
Potassium fertilizer use in Australia is relatively modest on a world scale, and
there is approximately 3 times more K removed in agricultural products than is
supplied. While K removal is highest on sugarcane farms, there is a modest deficit
for most farms due to low productivity. Regional differences in K use and PNB K
reflect the intensity of production and the inherent K fertility of the regions, although
there are inconsistencies in the data available to estimate K balances and nutrient

performance indicators. Western Australia uses most K fertilizer for grain production. Victoria uses K mainly on intensive pastures (especially dairy), while in
Queensland K is mainly focused on the sugar industry. The data presented here
indicate that grain-producing fields in the higher rainfall regions of southern
Australia are in significant K deficit, despite the low inherent K fertility. Private,
state, and federal agencies are addressing and communicating evidence-based nutrient management strategies to growers to overcome these deficits and improve
productivity (Norton 2014b, Norton and vanderMark 2016).


11.3 Southeast Asia


The K balance assessment for Southeast Asia includes four crops most important
both economically and for K use: rice (Oryza sativa L., maize (Zea mays L.),
sugarcane, and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) in five countries in the region:
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The choice of crops,
countries, and crop year included in the K balance estimation were based on the
availability of data on fertilizer K application by crop and country. The latest


294 K. Majumdar et al.


available dataset with the highest number of countries and crops in the region was
reported by Heffer (2013) for the crop year 2010–2011.


11.3.1 Data Sources and Limitations


In 2010–2011, the five countries produced a total of 148.5 Mt of rice grain, 23.0 Mt
of maize grain, 132.3 Mt of cane sugar, and 218.8 Mt of palm oil (as fresh fruit
bunch) (Table 11.3). The total area harvested for these four crops was 57.3 Mha,
accounting for 61% of the total crop area (94.9 Mha of arable land and permanent
cropland) in the five countries (Table 11.4). For each crop, the percentage of the total
crop area was: 38% for rice, 8% for maize, 3% for sugarcane, and 12% for oil palm.
For the estimation of crop K removal, production data for 2010 and 2011
(Table 11.5) was combined with published values of K content in harvested crop
biomass. These values were 2.83 g K kg [–][1] for rice grain (Buresh et al. 2010); 2.38 g
K kg [–][1] maize grain (Setiyono et al. 2010); 1.1 g K kg [–][1] cane sugar (Dierolf et al.
2001); 3.87 g K kg [–][1] oil palm fresh fruit bunch for Indonesia (Donough et al. 2014);

and 3.51 g K kg [–][1] oil palm fresh fruit bunch for Malaysia (Tarmizi and Mohd Tayeb

and Thailand was similar to that of Indonesia. Since oil palm production data were
reported by USDA FAS (2017) as palm oil, the equivalent production of fresh fruit
bunches was calculated by assuming an oil yield of 20% of fresh fruit bunch biomass
(Corley and Tinker 2016).


11.3.2 Trends in Potassium Balance


Rice is the most important cereal crop in Southeast Asia, covering 38% of the total
crop area (Table 11.4). In rice, crop removal exceeded K application with a deficit
of –33 to –83 kt K 2 O in Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand; whereas K application
exceeded crop removal with a K surplus of 46 kt and 96 kt K 2 O in Malaysia and


296 K. Majumdar et al.


Vietnam, respectively (see PNBI K values in Table 11.5). Across the five countries,
there was a K deficit of –28 kt K 2 O in rice-growing areas. Since the calculated
PNBI K values only accounted for grain removal, greater K deficits are expected in
areas where rice straw is also removed from the field (for off-farm use). Previous
studies reported negative K balances in rice in irrigated long-term experiments in
Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam (Dobermann et al. 1996) and in rainfed lowland
rice in Indonesia (Wihardjaka et al. 1999).
Maize is the second most important cereal crop in Southeast Asia, with an area
harvested of 7.64 million ha in the five countries (Table 11.4). Out of the five
countries, only the Philippines showed a K deficit (–15 kt K 2 O), while the K balance
in the other four countries ranged from 0.7 kt K 2 O (Malaysia) to 80 kt K 2 O
(Indonesia) (Table 11.5). Similar to rice, PNBI K calculations for maize only
accounted for grain removal; hence PNBI K will be further reduced if K removed
with maize stover is included. Pasuquin et al. (2014) reported cases of negative K
balance in maize in Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam when most of the aboveground residues were removed from the field. In Southeast Asia, farmers manage
their maize residues in varied ways. In the Philippines, for example, while many
farmers retain the residues in their field, some still practice full removal or burning of
residues to facilitate land cultivation, especially with the use of non-mechanized
tillage implements.
Oil palm occupies the second largest area harvested, with Indonesia and Malaysia
being the two largest producers of oil palm in the region (Table 11.4). While oil palm
is only grown in four of the five countries, it is the biggest user of applied K fertilizer
(69%) among the four crops (Table 11.5). Potassium applications exceeded crop
removal (positive PNBI K values) in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; while crop
removal exceeded applications (negative PNBI K value) in the Philippines
(Table 11.6).
Sugarcane covers the least area among the four crops (Table 11.4), but it is one of
the important economic crops in the region and a heavy user of fertilizer
K. Table 11.5 shows that annual application of K exceeded crop removal by
0.8–43 kt K 2 O in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. On the other hand, K deficit
is indicated in the Philippines (–16 kt K 2 O) and Thailand sugarcane production (–
30 kt K 2 O). A previous study reported negative K balances in Thailand for yields of
30 t ha [–][1] (of dry cane) and above at a K fertilizer application rate of 94 kg K 2 O ha [–][1]

(Trelo-ges et al. 2004).
In the five countries in Southeast Asia included in this K budget, the amount of K
fertilizer needed to replace crop removal follows the order: oil palm > rice >
sugarcane > maize (Table 11.6). To be able to replace crop removal of the four
crops in five countries, a total amount of 3.46–5.76 Mt K 2 O will be needed at
fertilizer use efficiencies of 50% and 30%, respectively. With the current crop area
dedicated to these crops in this region, the crops with the largest requirement for K
fertilizer are: oil palm in Indonesia and Malaysia, rice in the Philippines and

–
Vietnam, and sugarcane and rice in Thailand. Based on 2010 2011 fertilizer application and the estimated fertilizer requirement to replace crop removal, opportunities
for improving K application are evident in most of the countries and crops.

Fertilizer K deficits of current application practices (Table 11.6) are indicated in:
rice for all countries except Malaysia; maize in the Philippines, Thailand, and
Vietnam; sugarcane for all countries except Malaysia; and oil palm for all four
countries. In the 30% fertilizer use efficiency scenario, there is a predicted annual
total K deficit in the five countries of 1.2 Mt K 2 O in rice; 0.068 Mt K 2 O in maize;
0.39 Mt K 2 O in sugarcane; and 1.46 Mt K 2 O in oil palm. Current production levels
also indicate opportunities for increasing production with intensification through
improved crop and nutrient management, which may require a further increase in K
fertilizer application.


11.4 China


China is the largest national consumer of fertilizer nutrients, accounting for nearly
30% of global fertilizer use. From 1978 to 2015, total (N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O) fertilizer
consumption increased from 8.8 to 60.2 Mt, with an average annual increase rate of
5.3%. The N, P 2 O 5, and K 2 O consumption in 2015 was 30, 19, and 11 Mt,
respectively.

11.4.1 Potassium Use and Crop Production


Potassium deficiency in crops was initially reported in Southern China in the 1970s
(Lin 1989). Potassium did not receive as much attention as N and P in the next
decade but now has become a widespread limiting factor in agricultural production,
especially in some parts of northeast and north-central China (Liu et al. 2000).
Recent research has demonstrated that K deficiencies in intensified agricultural
production areas in China continue to be a challenge (He et al. 2009); however, K
fertilizer input has increased dramatically over time, rising from 0.38 Mt K 2 O in
1980 to 10.6 Mt K 2 O in 2015, with an average annual increment of 0.29 Mt
K 2 O. The total grain production increased from 310 to 657 Mt during the same
period, with an average annual increase rate of 2.1%. Fruit and vegetable production
increased annually by 6.4% and 9.8%, respectively, in the past 20 years. The
unprecedented growth in China’s fertilizer consumption and crop production in the

–
last decades prompted researchers to look at nutrient input output balances. Understanding the surplus/deficit and balance of cropland nutrients provides guidance to
the production, distribution, and application of fertilizer.


11.4.2 Potassium Balance Studies


Previous research assessed farmland nutrient balances in China, including the K
balance at various scales (Wang et al. 2014; Chuan et al. 2014). These assessments
emphasized that the nutrient balance estimations at the national scale would help
develop national fertilizer policies, including decisions on investments for fertilizer
factories and the exploitation of local resources and minerals to supply nutrients.
Potassium balances for the 30 provinces in China from 1961 to 1997 illustrated
annual K depletion that increased from 2.9 Mt K (3.5 Mt K 2 O) in 1961 to 8.3 Mt K
(10.0 Mt K 2 O) in 1997 (Sheldrick et al. 2003). Negative PNBI K (from –17 to –
245 kg K ha [–][1] year [–][1] ) were also reported from long-term fertilizer experiments in
rice-based systems, irrespective of mineral K application and site (Zhang et al.,
2010). Negative PNBI K persisted on wheat–maize rotations even at K application
rates as high as 112–300 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] (Tan et al. 2012). A winter wheat study in the
North China plain between 2005 and 2007 showed negative K balance in all the
treatments under different production practices, especially at high-yield levels (Niu
et al. 2013). About 79% of the assessed on-farm trials (n ¼ 120) in potato (Solanum
tuberosum L.) in north-western China had an average negative balance of –102 kg K
ha [�][1] (Li et al. 2015). This overwhelming negative balance of K in soils of China
started improving (becoming less negative) with the increase in fertilizer K application, along with the in-field retention of crop residues (Wang et al. 2014; Shen et al.
2005). Several studies also show significant soil K surpluses in vegetable production
fields in China (Huang et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008).


11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 299


11.4.3 Potassium Balances in Grain and Cash Crops


These studies provide critical information on K balances in China but mainly focus
on specific experimental sites or short-term observations. Nutrient balances can vary
considerably from year to year, and short-term studies providing limited information
can be misleading.
Two follow-up studies in the past few years provide a more comprehensive
overview on how soil test K levels and crop K responses changed over time and
space, and the status of K balances across China. He et al. (2015) used large on-farm
experimental datasets to assess spatial and temporal variation in soil test K and crop
responses to K between 1990 and 2012. The authors utilized datasets for plantavailable K from on-farm experiments, where soil samples from a depth of 0–20 cm
were collected and analyzed before sowing. The corresponding crop yield differences were measured between treatments fertilized with N+P+K or with only N+P.
The data were spatially desegregated and grouped based on geographical locations,
such as northeast (NE), northcentral (NC), northwest (NW), southeast (SE), and
southwest (SW) regions of China. In addition, each region was further divided into
two sub-groups based on soil utilization pattern, grain crop, and cash crop systems.
The grain crop category included wheat, maize, rice, potato, and soybean (Glycine
max (L.) Merr.), while the cash crop group included vegetables, fruits, rapeseed
(Brassica spp.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), cotton, and sugar crops. Results
indicated that soil-extractable K concentrations (exchangeable K) increased with
time between 1990 and 2012. For grain crops, exchangeable K concentrations
increased only slightly; however, for cash crops, the K concentrations increased
dramatically over the period. The trends of increased soil K in cash crops were
consistent with increased relative yield for cash crops and the high fertilizer K
application rates. The authors suggested that higher soil K concentrations under
cash crops increased the average soil K estimations in China, leading to assumptions
of surplus K in all soils. Even though extractable K in soils under grain crops
increased in the Northcentral, Southeast, and Southwest China in the 2000s as
compared with that in the 1990s, the average soil K values were less than the critical
concentration of 80 mg L [–][1], except in the NW region. The results indicated that the
exchangeable K continued to show a declining trend with large crop removal
associated with higher yields.
The PNB K was greater than 1.0 for both cash and grain crop categories,
suggesting that K removal by crop uptake exceeded K inputs from fertilizer
(Fig. 11.3). The PNB K was higher for cash crops (mean: 2.1; range: 1.1–4.2) than

–
for grain crops (mean: 1.3; range: 1.0 1.5), indicating higher K depletion in cash

crops.

11.4.4 Spatial and Temporal Changes in Potassium Balance


A comprehensive assessment of soil K balances between 1980 and 2010 was
undertaken by Liu et al. (2017b) using 31 provincial datasets from the China
Agriculture Statistical Report for 1981 and 2011. The K consumption from fertilizers, human and livestock manure, straw return to field, cake manure, deposition,
irrigation, seeds, crop removal, and K loss from soils were calculated with provincial
data and parameters from refereed literature. The arable crop output was the


11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 301


principal nutrient output pathway in the agricultural systems, which was calculated
through economic yield and K requirement per unit of economic yield of various
crops. The arable crop outputs were categorized into five groups: cereal crops, fruit
and vegetables (fruit, vegetable, and melons), oil crops (oil crops and beans),
industrial crops (sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), sugarcane, fiber crops, cotton and
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)) and root crops (sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.)
Lam.) and potato). The PNBI K (kg K 2 O or kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ) was estimated by calculating the total K added to farmland from various sources during the year (inputs)
and subtracting the total amount of K removed from farmland by crop removal and K
loss from leaching and runoff (outputs).
The farmland PNBI K was significantly different between 1980 and 2010 at the
provincial scale. The PNBI K in China changed from an average deficit of –13.6 kg
K 2 O ha [–][1] in 1980 to a surplus of 22.9 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] in 2010 (Fig. 11.4). In 1980,
almost 68% of the farmland area across 19 provinces showed K deficits (very low
and low classes); however, 30% of farmland area in 10 provinces had PNBI K in the
moderate class (1–50 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ) (Fig. 11.4a). In 2010, 40 and 44% of the
farmland was in the low and moderate PNBI K classes in 9 and 13 provinces,
respectively. Meanwhile, 11% of farmland was in the high PNBI K class in 5 provinces. Only 6% of farmland area showed a PNBI K in the very high class in four
provinces (Fig. 11.4).
Liu et al. (2017a) followed up with a more comprehensive K balance across four
decades: 1980–1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2009, and 2010–2015. The data were
desegregated into six agricultural regions, based on geographical locations and
China’s administrative divisions: northeast (NE); north-central (NC); northwest
(NW); the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR); southeast

Mineral fertilizer, organic manure, and other K input resources (atmospheric
deposition, irrigation, and seeds) accounted for 33% (4.91 Mt K 2 O), 59% (8.85 Mt
K 2 O), and 8% (1.19 Mt K 2 O) of the total K input from 1980 to 2015, respectively.
The K input through fertilizers increased from 0.38 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 10.58 Mt
K 2 O in 2015. At the regional level, K inputs increased in all regions over time.
Increases in K inputs were greatest for the SE and least for both the NW and NE
(Fig. 11.5a). By 2015, K input in the SE was the highest, followed by the SW,
MLYR, NC, NW, and NE.
The average K output from 1980 to 2015 was 14.78 Mt K 2 O (146 kg K 2 O ha [–][1]

year [–][1] ). Crop removal accounted for 99% (14.63 Mt K 2 O) of the total output from
1980 to 2015. Cereals removed 70, 65, 55, and 56% of the total K output in the
1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, respectively. The K output of fruit and vegetables
and oil crops increased over the years with average annual increments of 0.13 and
0.05 Mt of K 2 O, respectively. Potassium outputs increased over time in all regions
(Fig. 11.5). The K outputs in MLYR and SE were significantly larger than those in
other regions. In the NE, K outputs increased from 1982 to 1989 then stabilized, with
some variation, from 1990 on.
Potassium nutrient balance intensity increased from its lowest value in 1984
(–3.23 Mt K 2 O) to a relatively stable value of around 2.1 Mt K 2 O in 2015. At the

On average, the PNBI K changed from its 1980 level by –24.2 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] in the

surplus of any region (Fig. 11.5). The average PNBI K in the 2010s (2010–2015)
varied by region: SW (31.3 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ) > MLYR (15.9 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ) > NC
(9.5 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ) > NW (8.2 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ) > NE (–11.9 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ). The NE

–
region stayed in deficit for the entire period of assessment (1980 2015). The positive
PNBI K in the NW region declined over time. In the NC region, PNBI K increased
during the first three decades but declined in the 2010s.
Reliable K fertilizer use and crop output data, along with information from
published peer-reviewed literature, allowed estimation of K balance in Chinese
agriculture. Recent assessments of K inputs, outputs, and PNBI K in China showed
significant spatial and temporal differences. Widespread negative K balances in soils
before the 1980s have now changed toward a more positive balance due to increased
use of K fertilizers and retention of crop residues in the field. However, regional and


304 K. Majumdar et al.


crop-specific disparity in K use provides opportunities to further refine the K balance
through site-specific nutrient management for sustainable crop production systems.


11.5 India


India is the second-largest consumer of fertilizer in the world. In nutrient terms, the
2.5 Mt of K 2 O consumed in 2014 was 7.7% of the global consumption. Alluvial
(Inceptisols and Entisols), Red and Lateritic (Alfisols and Ultisols), and Black
(Vertisols) soils are dominant soil types in India. The Alluvial soils in the IndoGangetic Plains and elsewhere have ample available and reserve soil K. Despite
having high available soil K, the Black soils, mainly in the Central and Western
India, often show positive yield responses to added K. This response is most likely
due to low K availability because of relatively higher contents of Ca and Mg in these
soils. The Red and Lateritic soils in coastal and peninsular India typically have lower
K content. Heffer (2013) estimated that over 60% of the total N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O is
used in cereal crops. Potassium used in cereals is about 50% of the total consumption. An estimate by Tewatia et al. (2017), using crop production statistics of
2015–2016 and crop nutrient uptake information from multiple sources, showed
that removal of K 2 O by cereals is about half of the total K removed by all crops. The
seeming parity between K applied and removed by cereals, however, is misplaced as
the removal of K by cereals is about 11 times more than the applied K.


11.5.1 Crop Requirement and Potassium Use


Post Green Revolution, India’s agricultural production was largely driven by inorganic fertilizer use. The demand for crop commodities will rise in the future with
population increase and changing food habits. Chand (2007) estimated that
262, 19, 54, and 345 Mt of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane, respectively,

–
would be required in 2020, compared to the base year (2004 2005) production of

–
193, 14, 35, and 262 Mt of the same crops. In 2014 2015, 235, 17, 28, and 363 Mt of
cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane were produced in India (FAI 2016). A
slowdown of crop productivity (Kumar et al. 2004) and decline in PFP (NAAS
2006), however, has been identified as major concerns. Biswas and Sharma (2008)
showed that response to applied fertilizer (kg grain [kg of added NPK] [–][1] ) decreased
from 13.4 to 3.7 between 1970 and 2005.
Imbalanced fertilization, more specifically low use of K, has been identified as
one of the major reasons for declining PFP in India. Several studies identified
inequality between applied K and its removal in harvested crops, which impacts
crop productivity, nutrient use efficiencies, and soil K mining (Naidu et al, 2011;
Majumdar et al. 2012, 2016; Singh et al. 2014). Long-term cropping with negative
PNBI K has been associated with yield declines in the rice–wheat system in South

a rice (Oryza sativa L.); wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)


Asia (Regmi et al. 2002). Potassium partial nutrient balance intensities were negative
even with recommended fertilizer application rates of K and were least negative
when farmyard manure was a nutrient source or wheat residues were returned to the
field. Although the K-supplying capacity of illite-dominated alluvial soils of the
Indo-Gangetic Plains is relatively high (Dobermann et al. 1996), long-term intensive
cropping with inadequate application of K have been associated with large negative
PNBI K and depletion of native K reserves (Gami et al. 2001; Yadvinder-Singh et al.
2004). Multi-location studies in the rice–wheat system indicated that soil reserves
contributed on an average 258 kg K 2 O in K omission plots (Tiwari et al. 2006)
(Table 11.7). Several researchers have assessed K balances in systematic ways
contributing to our understanding at various scales.


11.5.2 Potassium Balance at the Country Scale


The K partial nutrient balance intensity in most soils of India was largely negative as
crop removal far exceeded K additions through manures and fertilizers. Tandon
(2004) reported an annual negative PNBI of –9.7 Mt of N+P+K in 1999–2000, of
which 19% was N, 12% was P, and 69% was K. Satyanarayana and Tewatia (2009)
estimated K balances in major agriculturally important states of India. Besides the
major field crops, the authors considered the removal of nutrients by fruits and
vegetables in all the states; tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze), coffee (Coffea spp.),
jute (Corchorus capsularis L.), rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A. Juss.)
Müll.Arg.), and other plantation crops in states wherever applicable; and the total
production values of commodities were multiplied by the nutrient uptake coefficient
to arrive at nutrient removal figures. The authors used crop production, state fertilizer

use, and nutrient uptake coefficients from the Fertilizer Association of India (FAI)
database (FAI 2008), as well as baseline information and assumptions on nutrient
contribution from sources other than fertilizer, such as organic manures, farmyard
manure, crop residues, irrigation water, biological nitrogen fixation for individual
states while estimating PNBI K . Nutrient additions only through fertilizer was used
where information on other nutrient sources was not available. The overall negative
K balance was estimated at 9.7 Mt, and the western region (3.8 Mt) had the highest
share, followed by northern (2.6 Mt), eastern (1.9 Mt), and southern (1.3 Mt) regions
(Table 11.8).
Dutta et al. (2013) estimated PNBI K in different states of India using the IPNI
NuGIS approach (Fixen et al. 2012). The study used the K addition through
inorganic and organic sources and the removal by key crops to estimate the K
budget. The authors used data for fertilizer and the total amount of recoverable
manure used in different states from various sources (DAC 2011; FAI 2007, 2011).
The amount of manure consumed in each state was multiplied by a coefficient, based
on average K content in recoverable manure, to estimate the K 2 O contribution from
organic sources. The K 2 O removal by crops was calculated by multiplying production with K 2 O removal coefficient (GOI 2020; FAI 2007, 2011). The crops considered in this study were rice, wheat, maize, barley, chickpea, pigeon pea (Cajanus
cajan (L.) Millsp.), green gram (Vigna radiata (L.) R.Wilczek), lentil (Lens culinaris
Medik.), moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq.) Marechal), groundnut (Arachis
hypogaea L.), sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), mustard (Brassica juncea (L.)
Czern.), linseed, (Linum usitatissimum L.) cotton, and sugarcane. The study reported
large negative PNBI K values in northern, western, and eastern regions (Fig. 11.6).
The authors attributed the negative PNBI K in most states of India to inadequate
application of K, high removal of K by intensive cropping, and export of crop
residues. They cautioned that negative PNBI K in soils is not a one-off phenomenon
but a recurring one, which will significantly affect the future sustainability of crop
production.
Patra et al. (2017), using the national soil health card database, highlighted
significant decreases in soil K concentrations in areas of north-western India that
were earlier flagged as areas of high negative PNBI K (Fig. 11.6). Recently, Tewatia
et al. (2017) did an extensive analysis of nutrient inputs and outputs for all major
crops, including food grains and other cereals, pulses, oilseeds, forages, fiber crops,
fruits, vegetables, plantation crops, spices, tubers, and sugarcane. The authors used

the FAI database for fertilizer consumption and crop production data for 2015 and
2016, and nutrient uptake coefficients were taken from several sources. Only
inorganic fertilizer contributions were considered as inputs. The authors calculated
a net negative K balance of –8.6 Mt of K 2 O, which was 66% of the net negative
N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O balance (Table 11.9). The authors further desegregated the K
balance information at a crop and land area basis. The average areal negative balance
was –42.2 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] across all crop groups. It was highest for sugarcane (–121 kg
K 2 O ha [–][1] ), fruits (–71 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ), and plantation crops (–58 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ), while
pulses (–15 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ) had the lowest K deficit, most likely due to low productivity levels. The negative balance in food grains was –40 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] ; however, it
has the most profound effect on K balance at the national scale as the major food
grain crops (rice, wheat, and maize) cover nearly 80% of the arable land.


11.5.3 Potassium Balance at the Cropping System Scale


Cropping systems strongly influence soil nutrient balance. Two or more crops are
generally grown in a sequence within a year in much of India, except where climatic
or other factors restrict growing multiple crops. Yadav et al. (1998) illustrated how
nutrient removal differs by the number of crops grown in sequence and by the type of
crops within the cropping system rotation (Table 11.10).
Careful nutrient and crop management planning is necessary for cropping systems to avoid nutrient imbalances in the soil. Long-term intensive cropping with
inadequate application of K results in K mining leading to large negative balances
and depletion of native K reserves (Gami et al. 2001; Regmi et al. 2002; Singh et al.
2002; Yadvinder-Singh et al. 2005; Majumdar et al. 2016). Therefore, adequate
input of K is essential to prevent further depletion of soil K. Fixation of applied K as
non-exchangeable K is also not ruled out in K-depleted soils. Evidences suggested
that the non-exchangeable K reserves of the mica-rich soils of the Indo-Gangetic
Plains (IGP) were exhausted due to continued lack of K fertilization in intensive
cropping, that raised their K fixation capacity (Tiwari et al. 1992; Bijay-Singh et al.
2003). Singh et al. (2018) stated that short-term inconsistencies, if any, in crop
response to K or changes in exchangeable K content in the soils of the IGP should
not guide the K fertilization decisions. Rather, adequate K replenishment matching
with annual K removals is required for the long-term sustainability of the rice–maize
system in these soils without impairing soil fertility. Soil K depletion is faster with its

continuous inadequate replenishment. It is further aggravated when crops remove
more K than required as luxury consumption. The data presented in Table 11.11
indicate that except for the crop sequences with a pulse or potato as component


310 K. Majumdar et al.


crops, all other sequences remove more K than N and P. The higher output: input
ratio for K compared with N and P indicated insufficient K addition under different
cropping systems, leading to depletion of soil K (Tiwari et al. 1992; Singh et al.
2015a, b).
Multi-locational studies (Singh et al. 2014) revealed that omission of K in rice–
wheat cropping system resulted in annual mining of 158–349 kg K ha [–][1] from soil
reserves, and the authors cautioned that continuous inadequate application of K in
this cropping system may not be able to sustain high productivity over time. In a

–
long-term experiment on rice rice rotations at Gazipur in Central Bangladesh, Mazid
Miah et al. (2008) reported that rice grain yield decreased sharply in a clay-loam soil
from about 10 t ha [–][1] in 1985 to 6.2 t ha [–][1] in 2000 in the K-omission plots, whereas K
application at 50 kg ha [–][1] resulted in positive K balance and maintained rice yields. In

–
another study on rice wheat rotations in northwest Bangladesh, the application of
54 kg K ha [–][1] increased average grain yield by 25–30% of rice and wheat by 53–86%
across a range of demonstration plots on farmers’ fields (Mazid Miah et al. 2008).
Buresh et al. (2010) showed that near-neutral K balance in rice–wheat cropping
systems in India would require 100 and 15% retention of rice and wheat residues,
respectively, when irrigation water contributed 125 kg K ha [–][1] . Replacing winter
wheat with maize in the rice–wheat cropping system, with typical crop management
practices in India, reduces PNBI K well below –100 kg K ha [–][1], which becomes even
more negative at higher system productivity. At a maize grain yield of 12 t ha [–][1],
there is a net export of about 200 kg K ha [�][1], which is often difficult to resupply with
external K applications until and unless crop residues are fully returned to the field.
Residues are often removed for several reasons. Rice straw has several competitive
uses. Maize residue is difficult to manage in the field, and N immobilization often

–
occurs because of high C:N ratios in that residue. Nutrient depletion replenishment
studies in the rice-based systems in Bangladesh have also shown negative PNBI K
(Timsina et al. 2013).
On-farm results from the AICRP-IFS (2012) showed negative PNBI K in farmers’
fields across locations and cropping systems (Table 11.12). Potassium partial nutrient balance intensity was influenced by the crops selected in various cropping

systems.
The “SR+M” treatment received supplemental application of secondary and
micronutrients, along with the same amount of N, P, and K as in “SR” (the state
recommendation). The addition of secondary and micronutrients to SR triggered
higher removal of K in most cases, suggesting that the application of limiting
secondary and micronutrients, even at suboptimal application of major nutrients,
may increase crop yield and removal of K.
The deficit in K supply will cause changes in K soil concentrations. Singh et al.
(2013) showed that, in the absence of added K fertilizer, average exchangeable and
non-exchangeable K decreased by 13–18 mg kg [–][1] and 26–41 mg kg [–][1], respectively,

–
across 60 on-farm locations during one rice wheat cropping cycle. Another study
assessing spatial variation of different soil K fractions in an intensively cultivated
region of West Bengal (Chatterjee et al. 2015) associated the low non-exchangeable
K in parts of the study area with high K removal exceeding K application rates in
banana (Musa spp.) plantations. Non-exchangeable K is not measured in routine soil

remains unnoticed.

In conclusion, high-resolution and high-quality data are available to assess K or
other nutrient balances in India. Several assessments at national and cropping system
scales showed that K balances are largely negative. Low application rates of K in
crops combined with high offtake of K at harvest due to straw and other crop residue
removal from farms are the major reasons. The on-farm studies showed declines in
exchangeable and non-exchangeable K fractions in soils of intensively cultivated
areas. Potassium fertilization decisions based on agronomic evidence are required to
improve crop yields and farm profitability and to maintain K fertility of Indian soils.

11.6 Sub-Saharan Africa


Soil fertility depletion is considered one of the major factors limiting crop production
in sub-Saharan Africa. Crop production in soils of low native fertility with little or no
fertilizer application is depleting and unsustainable. Maintaining the productive
capacity of these soils through effective nutrient management remains a major
challenge. Nutrient mass balance in specific soil–crop systems is a reliable indicator
of nutrient depletion or mining.
When estimated at different spatial scales, nutrient balances provide insight into
sustainability challenges affecting production systems in the short- and long-term.
Access, price, and affordability of fertilizers are major production constraints in
Sub-Saharan Africa, especially for K fertilizers. The following sections outline the K
balance at various spatial scales in the region and how that affects crop productivity
in different production systems.


11.6.1 Potassium Balance at Continental and Country Scales


Analysis of nutrient balances in sub-Saharan Africa shows consistent negative trends
that result from the continuous cultivation of crops for many decades with little
addition of nutrient inputs in agricultural soils in the region. Annual PNBI K at the
regional level averages less than –15 kg K ha [–][1] and ranges between –5 and –45 kg K
ha [–][1] for various countries (Stoorvogel et al. 1993; Van den Bosch et al. 1998)
(Fig. 11.7). The losses of K from the soil translate to about 3 Mt K year [–][1] . The
average fertilizer use of 18 kg ha [–][1] of N+P+K in sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in
the world, accounting for less than 2% of the world fertilizer consumption. This is far
below requirements to prevent nutrient depletion. Potassium inputs from fertilizer
are proportionally lower than N and P, as most fertilizers that are recommended and
used in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa exclude K. As a result, the amounts of
K applied as fertilizer are less than 3 kg ha [–][1] . The application of K through organic
resources is also limited and negligible due to low amounts of manures and crop
residues that are available. The removal of K in grain and crop residues and K losses
through erosion and leaching combine to result in severe nutrient depletion. The
average yield of cereal crops which covers 80% of croplands is about 1.5 t ha [–][1],

–
accounting for removal of 20 30 kg K ha [–][1] . Potassium losses due only to erosion in
sub-Saharan Africa range from 3 to 15 kg of N+P+K ha [–][1] year [–][1] (Henao and
Baanante 2006).
Despite the overall large negative PNBI K in sub-Saharan Africa, nutrient balances
vary greatly among different cropping systems and agro-ecological zones. The
largest losses of 20–50 kg K ha [–][1] year [–][1] occur in the sub-humid savannahs of
West Africa and the highlands and sub-humid areas of east Africa and southern
Africa, a region with high potential for crop production and high population densities. Moderate K losses of 10–20 kg K ha [–][1] year [–][1] occur in the humid forests and

Baanante 2006)


wetlands of south-central Africa and Sudan. The soils in the arid zones in southern

–
and West Africa have the lowest K losses (5 15 kg K ha [–][1] year [–][1] ), mainly due to low
nutrient removals from low yields.


11.6.2 Potassium Balance at the Regional Scale


Potassium partial nutrient balance intensities for regions within countries are highly
variable, similar to the patterns of K balances at the continental level. For example,
PNBI K levels in Kenya are consistently negative, and range from –5 to –34 kg K ha [–][1]

year [–][1] (Henao and Baanante 2006) (Table 11.13). The Rift Valley region with the
lowest balances is characterized by high potential crop production and intensive
cultivation, while the highest nutrient balances in northeastern Kenya is associated
with arid conditions that result in both low crop yields and nutrient removals.
Relatively higher K fertilizer use in the central Kenya Rift Valley is due to large
areas of tea, coffee, and sugarcane production that receive recommended fertilizers
containing K.

11.6.3 Potassium Balance at the Farm Scale


Aggregated nutrient balance estimates at national and regional levels for
sub-Saharan Africa have shown overall large negative balances. At such scales,
variability is driven by soil-forming factors, such as the underlying geology and
position on the landscape, jointly termed the “soilscape” (Deckers 2002). In contrast,
variation in soil fertility associated with resource management at the farm level has
generally been overlooked, despite evidence that such operations affect K balances
and productivity of both crops and livestock (Smaling and Braun 1996; Giller et al.
2006). In addition, there are strong indications that K balances differ widely among
farms in different wealth categories and among plots at different distances from
homesteads (Shepherd and Soule 1998).
Differences in access to fertilizer by farmers contribute significantly to the
variability of fertilizer use. Farmers with more access to fertilizer use greater
amounts of mineral fertilizers (Tittonell et al. 2005) and tend to own more cattle
and thus manure, thereby using significant quantities of nutrients (Swift et al. 1989;
Achard and Banoin 2003). Consequently, K accumulates on farms with more access
to resources, often at the expense of the poorer farms.
Within farms, soil fertility status of different plots on smallholder farms in
sub-Saharan Africa may vary considerably due to both inherent factors and different
resource management strategies (Tittonell et al. 2005). Smallholder farms consist of
multiple plots managed differently in terms of allocation of crops, fertilizers, and
labor resources, resulting in within-farm soil fertility gradients caused by management strategies a common feature (Zingore et al. 2007). In most cases, both organic
and mineral fertilizer resources are preferentially allocated to the part of the farm
used for growing the main food-security crop, often close to the homestead, while
plots further away are neglected. Such management decisions culminate in the
creation of gradients of decreasing soil fertility with distance from the homestead
(Elias et al. 1998; Vanlauwe et al. 2002). Even where small quantities of manure and
mineral fertilizers are available, farmers still apply them at high rates by


11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 315


concentrating them in small areas. For instance, farmers in Zimbabwe apply cattle
manure at amounts as high as 80 t ha [–][1] year [–][1] by concentrating cattle manure on
preferred plots (Mugwira and Murwira 1998). The underlying reasons for targeting
of nutrient resources to few fields are not fully understood, but important factors
include farm size, distance of different plots from the homestead, restricted availability of fertilizers and manures, availability and efficiency of labor use, risk of
theft, and the need to reduce the risk associated with erratic rainfall (Nkonya et al.
2005).
Potassium application in African agriculture is low. Most of the farmland in
Africa is dependent on soils that experienced some level of erosion and nutrient
mining. The exchangeable K concentrations of the soil are generally low because of
the high degree of weathering and a long history of crop production without proper
soil management. Farmers’ wealth, resource management strategies, and access to K
fertilizers all contribute to significant variation in largely negative K balances across
African soils. Improved access to K fertilizers and their site-specific management are
key to increasing or even just maintaining the productive capacity of these soils.


11.7 North Africa


The North Africa region is dominated by the Mediterranean climate, with rainfall
during the colder winter and dry and hot during the summer. The soils of this region
are varied but generally low in organic matter. In arable lands, the predominant soils
are calcimagnesic, fersialitic, and clay-rich vertisols. Major land areas of North
Africa are under arid and semi-arid climate zones. Although lack of sufficient rainfall
is the main limitation of crop production, nutrient deficiencies also limit crop
productivity. Even though most of the research undertaken in North Africa in the
1980s reported that soils are well supplied with K (Ghanem et al. 1983; El Oumri
1985; Stitou 1985), continuous withdrawal of soil K has led to a decline in soil
fertility. Several areas in North Africa now report low exchangeable K and high
spatial variability of K in soils (Badraoui et al. 2003). As K availability in soils of
most North African countries (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) is perceived to be
generally adequate (Azzaoui et al. 1993; Mhiri 2002; Belouchrani et al. 2002),
fertilizer K consumption has remained very low, with an average of 12% of the
total consumed N, P, and K (FAOSTAT 2018). Potassium partial nutrient balance
intensities show negative trends due to crop K removal with none or low K inputs. In
some rainfed areas, farmers do not fertilize crops with K, even when it is required,
due to the relatively high cost of fertilizer, which has led to visible K deficiency
symptoms in crops in the last few decades (Mhiri 2002). For wheat, the main annual
crop of the region, fertilizer recommendations are based mainly on N and P, while K
application is generally neglected. Research on K also became limited in the last
decades with the most recent research programs on K undertaken more than
30 years ago.

Limited information showed negative PNBI K levels in Morocco across locations
and cropping systems (Table 11.14). In only two cases (the wheat–legume rotation in
Mohammedia and the potato–wheat–onion (Allium cepa L.) rotation in
Dar-Bouazza) was K added in quantities large enough to produce positive PNBI K .
A similar study in the Saharan region of Algeria showed positive PNBI K levels when
K was added in an irrigated wheat production system (Table 11.15). Since the K
balance in these studies accounted only for K output by grain removal, greater K
deficits would be expected in areas where wheat straw is also removed from the field
for off-farm use. Previous research demonstrated that critical levels of K in soils

depends on soil types and crop yield performances (Badraoui et al. 2002; Aissa and
Mhiri 2002). There are large differences in K use between rainfed and irrigated areas.

The expansion of irrigated area in North Africa due to incentive programs such as the
Green Plan in Morocco and the National Program for Rural and Agricultural
Development (PNDAR) in Algeria intensified production and increased K removal
by crops. As a consequence, growers in irrigated areas use more K for industrial
crops, fruits, and vegetables. In the citrus sector, which represents one of the main
export crops in the region, K plays an important role in fruit quality (Hamza et al.
2012). For irrigated wheat, research undertaken in the Doukkala region of Morocco
showed that wheat responded to added K fertilizer only when the yield was higher
than 5 t ha [–][1] (Badraoui et al. 2002). The highest consumers of K fertilizer are
greenhouse crop production systems. For example, banana production uses on
average of 500 kg K 2 O ha [–][1], strawberry production uses 400 kg K 2 O ha [–][1], pepper
(Capsicum spp.) production uses 140 kg K 2 O ha [–][1], and potato production uses
115 kg K 2 O ha [–][1] in northwest Morocco (Zerouali and Mrini 2004).
In Tunisia, the status of K in soils differs among three soil categories (Mhiri
2002): (1) acidic soils in the northwest are generally low in K; (2) alkaline, calcareous, fine-textured soils located in the north are rich in total and exchangeable K, and
are considered among the most fertile soils in the country; and (3) alkaline, calcareous coarse-textured soils, located in the center and south of the country and the
Sahel, are relatively low to very low in exchangeable K.
In Algeria, arable land is limited to less than 3% of the total geographical area.
Approximately 8.7 Mha are available to grow cash crops, forest, pasture, rangelands,
and scrub and alfalfa (Laoubi and Yamao 2012). The consumption of K fertilizer in
Algeria is low and represents about 11% of the total consumed N, P, and K fertilizer
in the country (FAOSTAT 2018).
There are few studies on K mass balance in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.
Potassium fertilizers are applied in limited quantities due to perceived high native K
in soils. Potassium deficiency in crops, however, is increasing due to higher removal
of K in intensive agricultural production systems with improved irrigation facilities.
Research evidence of better crop productivity and quality with site-specific K
management in the region suggests the need for higher levels of K inputs to crops.

11.8 United States


Potassium budgets for the USA were calculated using the NuGIS model (Fixen et al.
2012). The model calculates K budgets for each county in each state for 1987, 1992,
1997, 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Briefly, the NuGIS model considers the
sum of nutrient removal by up to 21 major crops as the only output: alfalfa
(Medicago sativa L.), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), barley, common bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), canola, maize grain, maize silage, cotton, hay (various
crops other than alfalfa), orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), peanut (Arachis
hypogaea L.), potato, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugarcane, sunflower,
sweet corn (Zea mays L.), tobacco, and wheat. The model uses crop-specific K
removal rates (g K kg [–][1] yield) and does not consider spatiotemporal variability. The
nutrient inputs considered by the model are fertilizer and manure.
A map PNB K for the contiguous 48 states of the USA is shown in Fig. 11.8. A
PNB K - 1 dominates the more arid western half of the USA where soil K levels have
historically been higher and where K application rates have generally been lower.
Based on the distribution of PNB K (Fig. 11.8), the USA was divided into four
groups, and trends in PNB K over time were assessed (Fig. 11.9). Temporal trends
were evaluated through linear regression of the log of PNB K calculated for each
regional group as well as for the USA. For the 48 contiguous states considered as a

in K removal to use (1.8% year [–][1] ). Much of this area is where cotton has traditionally
been grown, although cotton production has declined in recent years and is being
replaced by other crops, such as soybean. In the more arid western states (Group C),


320 K. Majumdar et al.


no significant trend emerged over time. Soil K concentrations have historically been
high; consequently, farmers have not applied much K fertilizer, resulting in a higher
PNB K, averaging 3.63.
The widely varied K-balance patterns across the USA arise from interactions of
climate, soil properties, cropping patterns, market conditions, governmental policies,
and many other factors. In general, the combination of rather steady K consumption
but increased yields and therefore increased nutrient removal has led to negative K
balances that are becoming increasingly negative in much of the USA.


11.9 Brazil


Since the soil nutrient status of Brazilian soils is generally low, supplying additional
nutrients is generally necessary to make agriculture effective and profitable. Potassium fertilizer consumption in Brazil is high, with consumption of 5.4 Mt K 2 O in
2015, ranking second in the world, with about 90% of it imported. A nutrient budget
can represent the amount of a nutrient that is exported from the whole country, a
specific location (e.g., state), or a field by a crop relative to the amount of applied
nutrient.

The nutrient budgets for Brazil have been calculated for the whole country, states,
and main crops based on fertilizer consumed (ANDA 2010–2015), crop production
for the eighteen major crops in Brazil, namely banana, common bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris L.), cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), castor bean (Ricinus communis
L.), cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), coffee, cotton, maize, orange, peanut, potato, rice,
sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, tobacco, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and
wheat (IBGE 2010–2015), and the average nutrient concentration in the harvested
portion of the crops (Yamada and Lopes 1998; Cunha et al. 2010, 2011, 2014).
The data from the most recent survey (Francisco et al. 2015) for an average of
4 years (2009–2012) are summarized in Table 11.16. It is important to note that the
Midwest region was responsible for 34% of the total K fertilizer consumption. This
region provides the bulk of soybean and maize production in the country, with

b For sugarcane, a 20% deduction was considered for K removal considering the regular disposal of
vinasse


plant-available K being inherently low in the soil. In summary, PNB K for the whole
country was 0.8.
Nutrient budgets for nine crops grown between the years of 2009 and 2012 are
presented in Table 11.17. Potassium use was higher than crop removal in most crops,
with the exception of beans (1.20). Potassium use was most balanced in soybean,
which had a PNB K of 0.99, followed by rice (0.86) and sugarcane (0.85). Coffee had
the lowest PNB K value (0.20).
Soybean, maize, and sugarcane are responsible for about 70% of the K fertilizer
consumed in Brazil. The PNB K levels for these crops are very reasonable, compared
to other situations worldwide, which is indicative that Brazil has had fairly appropriate use of K for these crops.
In terms of states (data not shown), there is a wide range of results in terms of K
mass balance, with some states presenting very low and others very high PNB K
levels (ranging from 0.54 to 3.17 in the main agricultural states). The results from
studies at specific locations with K mass balances allows researchers to focus on
crops or regions with the most severe deficits. For example, coffee and citrus were
two of the most important crops in Brazil with the lowest levels of PNB K among all
crops considered in the study. Consequently, it is necessary to better study fertilizer
practices and management systems that could increase NUE, leading to improved
PNB K levels for both crops.
In order to extend this analysis back to represent PNB for N, P, and K prior to
2009, trends in mass balances of these nutrients between 1988 and 2012 are provided
in Fig. 11.10. Nitrogen removal was higher than N input until the late 1990s. Later,
N use in the country increased due to the adoption of more intensive cropping
systems with higher inputs, especially for sugarcane, orange, coffee, and maize,

which resulted in lower N PNB (PNB N ), reaching 0.87 in 2012. Phosphorus PNB
(PNB P ) has essentially hovered around 0.60, which may be acceptable when compared to estimates of 0.30 in many situations. Potassium partial nutrient balances had
a similar decreasing trend as N, and PNB K reached 0.67 in 2012. Potassium showed
a dramatic increase in PNB K in 2009 (0.98) that reflected a significant and temporary
decrease in K use by farmers due to higher fertilizer prices. The generally steady
growth in nutrient use in Brazil in recent years has been effective in improving crop
production, increasing average yields. In 1990, the average yield was around 1.70 t
ha [–][1] and subsequently increased to 3.44 t ha [–][1] 20 years later.
Nutrient mass balances were estimated periodically to help identify gaps in
fertilizer use for specific crops or regions as well as to forecast future nutrient
demands. In this context, initiatives aimed at educating farmers and agronomists
on how to assess the performance of nutrient inputs are crucial for promoting
fertilizer use efficiency, minimizing nutrient loss, and increasing crop production
sustainability. With this in mind, a new tool was developed recently by Nutrição de
Plantas Ciência e Tecnologia (NPCT) in Brazil which allows the calculation of
specific nutrient mass balances at the farm level (NPCT 2020). Many agronomists
around the country are using this tool to calculate nutrient mass balances for different
crops and farms.
Calculation and publication of nutrient mass balances have helped agricultural
stakeholders to better understand the status and efficiency in the use of different plant
nutrients. For Brazil, the PNB K indicates generally appropriate ratios. Between 2009
and 2012, the average PNB K value was 0.80, which means that overall, 80% of the
fertilizer applied to crops was exported as agricultural products. The recently
released web tool to calculate nutrient mass balances at the farm level is helping
farmers around the country better manage fertilizers. This tool can be adapted for use
in other regions.

11.10 Southern Cone of Latin America


The total agricultural area of the five countries of the Southern Cone of Latin
America (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) is 238 Mha over a
total land area of 513.6 Mha. Total arable land represents approximately 22% of the
agricultural area. The total area for different crop groups defined by FAOSTAT is
56.5 Mha. Field crops (oil crops, coarse grain, and cereals) lead the area and
production in the region.
The main field crop areas of the Southern Cone include the Pampas and Gran
Chaco regions of Argentina and Uruguay, the southern highlands of eastern Paraguay, the eastern lowlands of Bolivia, and the central valleys and southern volcanic
regions of Chile.
Several soil associations are found in this region. Mollisols are dominant through
–
out the Pampas Chaco plains and Uruguay and are among the best suited for
agriculture because of their high native fertility. Alfisols are also widespread in the

–
Pampas Chaco region. Alfisols are generally fertile, with a high concentration of
nutrient cations. Ultisols and Oxisols are the main soils in eastern Paraguay. These
soils have good physical qualities but require high lime and phosphorus inputs.
Vertisols are mainly located in the central-eastern region of Argentina, in the Entre
Rios province, as well as in Uruguay. The vertisols have good nutrient concentrations, but challenging soil physical properties that demand careful management.
Alluvial soils dominate the eastern lowlands of Bolivia and also have good natural
soil fertility. Soils of Chile are quite variable and include Alfisols, Mollisols,
Entisols, and Inceptisols in the central region, and Entisols, Inceptisols, Andisols,
and Ultisols in the south. Native soil K availability is high in most of the cropping
areas of the Southern Cone of Latin America (Barbazán et al. 2012; Sainz Rozas
et al. 2013). Thus, fertilizer K consumption in the region has been low, about
335–425 kt K 2 O in the last years (summed across the individual country consumptions shown in Fig. 11.11). However, expansion of agriculture into new areas and
replacement of pastures by annual crops, mainly soybean, in the last 20 years
(Wingeyer et al. 2015) have increased K removal by grains and induced K deficiencies in several regions of Uruguay (Barbazán et al. 2012, 2017), and some areas of
Paraguay and Argentina.
In Argentina, the apparent consumption of K as fertilizers reached a peak of 54 kt
K 2 O (44 kt K) by 2007 (Fig. 11.11). An annual PNB K has been estimated for the four
major grain crops (soybean, corn, wheat, and sunflower) considering K application
and grain K removal (García and González Sanjuan 2016). This estimation used
average grain K concentration for the four crops and assumed that crop residues were
not removed from fields, a typical practice under no-tillage agriculture in Argentina.
The PNB K has been very high, with K removal exceeding K application by
almost 800 times during the period 2012–2014 (Fig. 11.12). Negative K mass

–
balances have reduced soil K availability (0 20-cm depth) to the current soil test
K levels of 370–750 mg K kg [–][1] in agricultural fields in the central Pampas (Correndo
et al. 2013). This is a 32–62% reduction from the pristine (pre-agriculture) soil test K

concentrations of 990–1140 mg K kg [–][1] (Fig. 11.13). Areas in northwestern Argentina under continuous sugarcane production for more than 50 years without K inputs
have decreased soil K concentrations to low enough levels that crops now respond to
K fertilization (Pérez Zamora 2015).
Consumption of fertilizer K in Bolivia is very low, with an annual average of
approximately 4.4 kt during 2012–2014 (FAOSTAT 2017). Estimation of annual K

removal in the main harvestable products, using average K concentrations in crops,
was 90.7 kt K year [–][1] for the same period, resulting in a PNB K - 20. Continuous
removal of soil K without replacement will eventually result in soil fertility declines
adversely affecting crop yields and farm profitability.
Mancassola and Casanova (2015) estimated a comprehensive nutrient balance for
agricultural production of Uruguay. In their study, nutrient removal was estimated
for: field crop production; beef, dairy, and wool production; fruit and vegetable
production; and forest production. Nutrient concentrations were gathered from local
information and from literature. Nutrient application was estimated from fertilizer
imports. In 2010, estimated PNBI K was approximately –24 kt K 2 O (–20 kt K)
(Fig. 11.14). These negative PNBI K levels were observed for most of the production
systems because of low K fertilization rates, with the exception of vegetables and
fruits. Furthermore, as soybean area increased in the last two decades, PNBI K in the
soil has become more negative due to the high K requirements of soybean. Considering an average grain K content in 3.6 Mt of soybean exports, it is estimated that
approximately 63 kt K 2 O was removed from the soil in 2014. In addition, agriculture
has also expanded to marginal soils in the north-central and eastern regions of the
country, where soils with low soil test K levels are common (Fig. 11.15). As a result,
K deficiencies in crops have been evident since the early 2000s (Barbazán et al.
2012, 2017).
Most of Paraguay’s agricultural production takes place in the eastern half of the
country on lateritic soils (mainly Oxisols and Ultisols) and includes soybean as a

main field crop, along with maize, wheat, sunflower, canola, and others. Causarano
Medina (2017) estimated nutrient mass balances for the period between 1996 and
2015, considering K fertilizer imports and K removal with soybean, maize, wheat,
rice, sunflower, and canola crop production. Figure 11.16 shows that PNB K in
Paraguay has decreased from 3 to 4 in the period between 1996 and 2003 to a
PNB K between 2 and 3 since 2003. Despite this improvement in PNB K, it is still
much greater than 1, indicating that soil K reserves are being heavily relied upon to
provide K for an increasingly productive agriculture. Recent surveys indicate that
58% of soil samples are above soil test K critical levels [> 0.5 cmol(+) kg [–][1] or
195 mg K kg [–][1] (Causarano Medina 2017).
In summary, countries of the Southern Cone of Latin America generally have
PNB K levels > 1, with correspondingly negative PNBI K values, indicating depletion
of soil K. In most of the region, crop production under these negative PNBI K levels
has been sustained from high levels of soil K reserves. However, K deficiencies and
positive crop responses to K fertilization have been detected in areas such as
Uruguay because of the continuous decline in the exchangeable and
non-exchangeable soil K fractions. Site-specific evaluations of soil test K would
provide information on the rate of decline of soil K supplies. Lastly, K application
decisions based on soil test calibrations would be required to sustain high crop yields
and farm profitability and to maintain soil K fertility.

11.11 Conclusion


Estimates of K mass balance provide insight into soil K fertility trends and potential
short- and long-term impacts of nutrient management practices in crop production
systems. The availability of reliable data to calculate K mass balances differs among
geographies. This is reflected in the scale, both spatial and temporal, and resolutions
at which K balances are estimated and reported in this chapter. Table 11.18 demonstrates that the quantity of information used to estimate PNB K and PNBI K varies
among assessments. Common to all, however, are estimates of K removed in


328 K. Majumdar et al.

harvested agricultural products and K applied as inorganic fertilizer. Besides the
availability and access to quality data, a large diversity of land use and methodological differences in estimating K mass balances are also responsible for divergent
metrics reported from various parts of the world. Farmer income levels, access to
information on K nutrition of crops, and translation of scientific knowledge to
changes in nutrient management practices also play important roles on how K
mass balances develop in a specific soil–crop context. This reinforces the concept
that nutrient balances are highly contextual and must be interpreted accordingly.
Nevertheless, PNB and PNBI K reported in this chapter, provide a useful global
overview of how K is managed in crops, cropping systems, or in mixed enterprises.
Nutrient balances are too often reported as snapshots of a year or one cropping cycle,
but the trends over time are perhaps the most diagnostic of the sustainability of a
given cropping system and its fertilization practices.
Temporal changes in soil K balance over decades at national scales are useful to
provide necessary policy guidance for production, distribution and use of K fertilizers. China is such a case. The highly negative PNBI K levels in soils of China in the
1980s have now changed to generally positive PNBI K levels, arising from increased
awareness at the policy and user level, better access to K fertilizers, and their proper
use in the field.
The spectrum of PNBI K is tilted more toward the negative side globally as more K
is removed with each harvest than applied. Potassium applications are typically low
in historically high K soils (e.g., countries in the Latin America Southern Cone,
North Africa, Western USA), due to an historic lack of crop yield responses.
However, crops growing in some soils in these regions are now responding to K
fertilizer applications, and crops are more frequently showing deficiency symptoms
when no K is applied. A combination of negative PNBI K and crop response to K
fertilizer is an unambiguous indication of K fertility decline.

The Indian example is noteworthy in this context. The general perception is
Indian soils are inherently rich in K and do not require further K fertilizer applications; however, overwhelming evidence of negative PNBI K levels at national,
regional, and cropping system scales, accompanied by large crop yield losses
when no K fertilizer is applied suggest that site-specific K management is necessary
to maintain soil K fertility. Negative PNBI K levels and PNB K levels greater than
unity indicate that a certain portion of crop requirements are derived from native K
reserves. Irrespective of the soil K status, this process depletes soil K. How soon the
gradual K depletion will impede crop production is a function of the magnitude of
the soil K reserve and the level of cropping intensity. Evidence suggests that soils
with very high K reserves will eventually become depleted under intensive cropping
when adequate K fertilizer is not applied (the PNB K levels are much greater than 1),
giving credence to K mass balance as a reliable indicator of soil K mining.
