Unraveling nutrient imbalances in contemporary agriculture is a research priority to
improve whenever possible yield and nutrient use efficiency in sugarcane ( _Saccharum_
spp.) systems while minimizing the costs of cultivation (e.g., use of fertilizers) and

environmental concerns. The main goal of this study was therefore to investigate
biomass and nutrient [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)] content,
partitioning, stoichiometry and internal efficiencies in sugarcane ratoon at varying yield

levels. Three sites were established on highly weathered tropical soils located in the
Southeast region of Brazil. At all sites, seasonal biomass and nutrient uptake patterns

were synthesized from four sampling times taken throughout the sugarcane ratoon
season. In-season nutrient partitioning (in diverse plant components), internal efficiencies
(yield to nutrient content ratio) and nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K) were determined at

harvesting. Sugarcane exhibited three distinct phases of plant growth, as follows: lag,

exponential–linear, and stationary. Across sites, nutrient requirement per unit of yield was

1.4 kg N, 0.24 kg P, and 2.7 kg K per Mg of stalk produced, but nutrient removal varied
with soil nutrient status (based on soil plus fertilizer nutrient supply) and crop demand

(potential yield). Dry leaves had lower nutrient content (N, P, and K) and broader N:P and

N:K ratios when compared with tops and stalks plant fractions. Greater sugarcane yield
and narrowed N:P ratio (6:1) were verified for tops of sugarcane when increasing both N

and P content. High-yielding sugarcane systems were related to higher nutrient content
and more balanced N:P (6:1) and N:K (0.5:1) ratios.

INTRODUCTION


Brazil is the world’s largest sugarcane ( _Saccharum_ spp.) producer, with approximately 9 million
hectares (ha) cultivated for biofuel, sugar, and electricity production (UNICA, 2015). In the
last decade, cultivated sugarcane area in Brazil increased by about 4 million ha, primarily
in the Southeast and Midwest regions. The latter expansion was explained by the significant
increase in bioethanol consumption by flex-fuel light-duty vehicles (Adami et al., 2012).

Leite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane



The increase in cropland area is growing in parallel with
technology investments implemented by sugarcane growers,
such as machinery for planting and harvest operations. Due
to environmental, agronomic, social, and economical reasons,
manual harvest with prior burning of sugarcane has been
replaced by harvesters, where dry leaves and tops (developing
leaves and meristem) are now left over the soil surface,
representing an input from 10 to 20 Mg ha [−][1] year [−][1] of dry
biomass (Fortes et al., 2013; Leal et al., 2013; Trivelin et al., 2013).
This new harvest system has been called “green cane management
system,” where ∼80% of the Brazilian sugarcane fields previously
harvested by hand with burning are currently harvested without
burning by harvesters (Leal et al., 2013). In São Paulo, largest
sugarcane-producing state, the crop is cultivated in 4.7 million ha,
and more than 85% of the total is mechanically green harvested
(UNICA, 2015).
The adoption of the green cane management system coupled
with other management practices (e.g., precision agriculture
tools) may modify nutrient requirements for modern sugarcane
cultivars. Traditional approaches to the mineral nutrition of
sugarcane included a strong emphasis on yield with a focus
on a balanced nutrition, economic productivity, and quality
(Kingston, 2014). Balanced nutrition implies that all essential
nutrients needed for proper growth and ripening of sugarcane
are available (Kingston, 2014). Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K)
are demanded in large amounts by the crop, ranging from 150
to 400 kg ha [−][1] (Silva and Casagrande, 1983; Shukla et al., 2009;
Oliveira, 2011; Mariano et al., 2016) for sugarcane yield varying
from 70 to 180 Mg ha [−][1] . Nitrogen is a major nutrient for plant
growth and tillering processes (Kingston, 2014), while K plays a
key role on osmoregulation, which is important for cell extension,
stomata movement, and enzyme activation (Epstein and Bloom,
2005; Shukla et al., 2009; Kingston, 2014). Phosphorus (P) is also
essential for tillering, root and shoot growth (Kingston, 2014).
In highly weathered tropical soils, usually characterized by low
nutrient availability, monitoring the fertility status and fertilizer
(NPK) application are essential practices to achieve and sustain
high sugarcane yield levels (Franco et al., 2011; Oliveira, 2011;
Trivelin et al., 2013).
For sugarcane, the nutrient ratio concept (also termed as
nutrient stoichiometry) is not a new tool for diagnosing nutrient
imbalances. Beaufils and Sumner (1976) developed the DRIS to
evaluate N, P, and K requirements of sugarcane irrespective of
plant age. Imbalances of these nutrients can be detected by means
of DRIS before a deficiency can be diagnosed securely by means
of threshold values (Beaufils and Sumner, 1976; Meyer, 1981).
However, nutrient ratios investigated were unstable. Nutrient
ratios (N:P and N:K) changed during the stage of sugarcane
development (Meyer, 1981). This occurs, because there is a
complex interaction and dynamics of these elements within the
soil-plant system (Meyer, 1981; Shukla et al., 2009; Mariano et al.,
2016). Besides this complexity, these studies did not properly
address the role of the nutrient ratios relative to the sugarcane
yield. Second, previous research on nutrient ratios (N:P and
N:K) for sugarcane probably were carried out in fields harvested
with prior burning, a different condition to the current and
future scenario. More than 70% of the total organic matter and



nutrients contained in the sugarcane straw are emitted to the
atmosphere via burning prior manual harvest (Mitchell et al.,
2000). Therefore, the straw layer left over the soil surface when
the crop is mechanically harvested without burning represents
a significant input of organic C and nutrients to the soilplant system, which can result in long-term benefits for the
sustainability (via C sequestration) and nutritional requirements
(by decreasing fertilizer needs) of sugarcane systems (Trivelin
et al., 2013). Likely, nutrient ratios correlate with sugarcane yield
in the green cane management system, but further investigations
are required for examining this new research area.
Brazil is one of the largest consumers of fertilizer, with
a nutrient demand expected to rise in the foreseeable future
(IPNI, 2015). However, the country strongly depends on the
international fertilizer market, especially for N (78%) and
K (90%). A feasible strategy to reduce this dependency is
to increase NUE, measured as sugarcane yield to nutrient
content ratio (so called “physiological efficiency”). Management
options for improving NUE from a cropping system perspective
must also consider both NUE components: nutrient recovery
and physiological efficiencies (Cassman et al., 2002; Ciampitti
and Vyn, 2012). In sugarcane, little is known about NUE
for green cane management systems. Vieira-Megda et al.
(2015) investigated the effect of fertilizer N sources and rates
on sugarcane productivity, without documenting changes in
biomass accumulation. Similar results were reported by Otto et al.
(2013), where among six sugarcane N-response trials, only one
site showed high yield response ( _>_ 25%) to fertilizer N. Probably,
lack of adequate balance on nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K)
can act as yield-limiting factor in the green cane management
system. Nutrient balances can help in closing yields gaps and
improve NUE. Therefore, plant nutrient ratios are valuable tool
for diagnosing crop nutrient imbalances (Ciampitti and Vyn,
2014). The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize
information on biomass and nutrient (N, P, and K) content,
partitioning, stoichiometry, and internal efficiency indexes in
sugarcane ratoon at varying yield levels at three site-years.


MATERIALS AND METHODS


Site Characteristics and Sugarcane
Genotypes
Three N-response trials for sugarcane fertilization were carried
out in the state of São Paulo, Southeast region of Brazil. Two
site-years were performed during the 2009/2010 growing season
(Sites 1 and 2), while the remaining experiment (Site 3) was
conducted in the 2012/2013 season. At all sites, experiments
were established in the first ratoon cycle, and the plant cane
(previous cycle) was harvested without burning the residues,
leaving a straw layer (formed by dry leaves and tops) over the soil
surface. Conventional tillage (plowing, disking, harrowing, and
furrowing) and soil correction (application of lime and gypsum)
were performed, on average, every 6 years at all sites. Site 1 was
located in Piracicaba (22 [◦] 35 [′] S; 47 [◦] 37 [′] W), in a Typic Hapludox
soil (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Plant cane (cultivar SP89-1115,
released by Copersucar) was mechanically green harvested in

May 2009, at 433 DAP. Site 2 was located in Santa Cruz das
Palmeiras (21 [◦] 47 [′] S; 47 [◦] 11 [′] W), in a Typic Eutrustox soil (Soil
Survey Staff, 2014). Plant cane (cultivar SP81-3250, released by
Copersucar) was also mechanically green harvested in June 2009
(456 DAP). Further details related to soil characteristics and
fertilizer and by-product management history for Sites 1 and 2
can be found in Mariano et al. (2015) and Vieira-Megda et al.
(2015). Site 3 was located in Severínia (20 [◦] 46 [′] S; 48 [◦] 45 [′] W), in a
Typic Eutrustox (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). The cultivar planted
was RB855453 (released by Ridesa), and the plant cane was
harvested without prior burning in August 2012, at 442 DAP.
As related to the genotypes, cultivar SP89-1115 is marketed as
early ripening, average for yield potential, sucrose and fiber levels;
cultivar SP81-3250 has a middle ripening, with high sugarcane
yield potential, sucrose and fiber levels; and cultivar RB855453 is
early ripening, but also with high yield potential and sucrose, and
average fiber levels (Tasso Júnior, 2007; Ridesa, 2010).


Soil Characterization and Experimental
Setup
Before the onset of the field trial, four composite soil samples
(obtained by combining and mixing nine individual samples
into a single sample per block) were taken at 20-cm soil
depth intervals until 100-cm soil layer for soil physicochemical
characterization. Soil pH was determined with 0.01 mol L [−][1]

CaCl 2 (ratio of 1:2.5 for soil and solution – w/v; van Raij et al.,
2001). Soil organic C was determined by wet oxidation following



the Walkley–Black procedure (Nelson and Sommers, 1996).
Available P, K, calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were extracted
by ion-exchange resins, and then quantified by colorimetric (P),
flame photometric (K), and atomic absorption spectroscopic
(Ca and Mg) methods (van Raij et al., 2001). Sulfur (SO 4 [−][2] S) was extracted with Ca(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 solution and determined by
turbidimetry, while exchangeable aluminum (Al) was extracted
with KCl solution and then determined by titration (van Raij
et al., 2001). CEC at pH 7.0 was measured by summation of
exchangeable cations (K, Ca, and Mg) and potential acidity
(H + Al). Base saturation was calculated by dividing the
summation of exchangeable cations by CEC, and then multiplied
by 100. Clay content was determined by the densimeter method
(Gee and Bauder, 1986). Physicochemical soil properties are
displayed in **Table 1** .
The experimental design within each location was a
randomized complete block with four (Sites 1 and 2) or
five (Site 3) replications. At Site 1, treatments were fertilizer
N sources [ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, calcium
ammonium nitrate, organo-mineral fertilizer, urea, and control
(no-N added)], applied at a rate of 100 kg N ha [−][1] . For Site
2, in addition to the above-cited treatments applied at Site 1,
ammonium sulfate (100 kg N ha [−][1] ) was also used. At Site 1,
plots were fertilized with 75 kg K ha [−][1], while 125 kg K ha [−][1]

and 15 kg P ha [−][1] were added at Site 2. The sources of K
and P used at both sites were KCl and triple superphosphate,
respectively. At both sites, fertilizers were manually applied over
the straw layer, in a band at 20 cm away from the plant row.

For Site 3, treatments used were rates of HSS (35 g organic
C kg [−][1] ; 115, 230, and 460 kg HSS ha [−][1] ), N (25, 50, and
100 kg N ha [−][1] ) and specific interactions between both factors
(115 kg HSS ha [−][1] + 25 kg N ha [−][1], 230 kg HSS ha [−][1] + 50 kg
N ha [−][1], and 460 kg HSS ha [−][1] + 100 kg N ha [−][1] ). A control
treatment (without addition of HSS and N) was also used.
Humic substances were composed by fulvic and humic acids,
both extracted and purified from peat, whereas N was applied
as urea. The HSS and HSS + N treatments were applied
directly to sugarcane leaves (foliar application), while N rates
were banded added over the straw layer, at 20 cm away from
the plant row. Treatments were added on September 2009,
October 2009, and October 2012 at Sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Phosphorus and K recommendations were defined based on
soil test methods ( **Table 1** ), whereas target yield concept was
employed to predict fertilizer N requirements (Spironello et al.,
1997). Biweekly precipitation and mean biweekly minimum and
maximum air temperatures recorded at each site are displayed in
**Figure 1** .



Biomass and Plant Nutrient Content

Measurements

Plant measurements followed similar protocols at all sites, and
a complete description can be found in Mariano et al. (2016).
Briefly, plants were randomly collected from 3-m plant row
(∼30 plants) in each experimental plot, and then separated into
stalks, dry leaves, and tops at all four sampling times (comparable
growth stages in all sites). In our study, tops refer to developing
(green) leaves from the stalk breakpoint to the apical meristem.
Sampling dates of plant biomass were performed at 139, 178,
235, and 330 DAH for Site 1; at 133, 170, 227, and 331 DAH
for Site 2; and at 145, 198, 290, and 380 DAH for Site 3. Fresh
samples were weighed and then ground in a forage grinder.
Subsamples of each plant component were oven dried at 65 [◦] C
until achieving constant weight, then weighed for dry weight
determination, and ground to pass through a 0.5-mm sieve
in a Wiley mill. Total N, P, and K concentration (g kg [−][1] ) in
plant tissues were determined by steam distillation (Kjeldahl),
gravimetry, and flame emission photometry, respectively (AOAC
International, 2006). Total aboveground biomass accumulation
(expressed in Mg ha [−][1] ) was determined by the summation of
all plant components collected in each sampling date. Total N, P,
and K content (kg ha [−][1] ) in each plant component was calculated
by multiplying each nutrient concentration by its respective
biomass value (in dry weight). Final aboveground biomass and
nutrient content were estimated based on the last sampling date
performed at each site. Sugarcane yield (Mg ha [−][1] ) was estimated
based on the fresh matter of stalks collected from 3-m plant row
in the last sampling date.


Biomass and Nutrient Partitioning
Seasonal biomass partitioning in dry leaves, stalks, and tops
of sugarcane collected along the ratoon cycle was fitted using
a sigmoid equation for estimating the crop growth modeling
(Mariano et al., 2016). The following equation (Eq. 1) was then



FIGURE 1 | Biweekly precipitation and mean biweekly minimum and
maximum air temperatures during a sugarcane growing season (first
ratoon cycle) conducted at Site 1 (A), Site 2 (B), and Site 3 (C), all
located in the Southeast region of Brazil.


used to predict seasonal biomass within each plant component:


_Y_ = _Y_ max (1)
{1 + exp −[ _(_ DAH − _A)/B_ ]}


where _Y_ is the aboveground biomass (Mg ha [−][1] ); _Y_ max is the
maximum aboveground biomass (Mg ha [−][1] ) from harvest of the
plant cane to harvest of the first ratoon; DAH is days after harvest
of plant cane; _A_ and _B_ are constants.
Nutrient (N, P, and K) partitioning among each plant
component along the ratoon cycle was fitted using a Gaussian
equation (Eq. 2) as follows:



� 2 [�]



_Y_ = _Y_ 0 + _A_ × exp



_DAH_ − _B_

Leite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane



where _Y_ is the aboveground nutrient (N, P, and K) content (kg
ha [−][1] ); _Y_ 0 is the intercept; DAH is days after harvest of plant cane;
_A_, _B_, and _C_ are constants.
Thermal time was expressed as GDDs, which are calculated
as accumulation of daily mean temperature values [(min.
temperature + max. temperature)/2] minus a base temperature
( _t_ _b_ ), below which growth is assumed not to occur. In this
study, _t_ _b_ was taken as 12 [◦] C, an appropriate value for sugarcane,
according to Allison et al. (2007). For terminology purposes, the
term “aboveground” will be used throughout the text to refer to
biomass and nutrient content in the following plant components:
tops, dry leaves, and stalks.


Harvest Index and Nutrient and
Reciprocal Internal Efficiencies
Harvest index was calculated as the stalks to the aboveground
biomass ratio (all determined in dry weight basis) obtained in
the last sampling date performed at each site. Similarly, nutrient
HI for N, P, and K were determined as the nutrient content
in the stalk as related to the total content in the aboveground
plant fraction. NIE (kg stalks kg [−][1] nutrient) was defined as
the final sugarcane yield (converted from Mg ha [−][1] to kg ha [−][1] )
produced per kg of nutrient content (N, P, and K) in aboveground
biomass component according to Ciampitti and Vyn (2012).
Therefore, the following equation (Eq. 3) was then used for the
NIE calculation:



SY
NIE =
� WNC



(3)
�



where NIE is nutrient internal efficiency; SY is the sugarcane yield
(kg ha [−][1] ); and WNC is the whole-plant (aboveground) nutrient
(N, P, and K) content (kg ha [−][1] ).
In addition, the RIE (kg nutrient Mg [−][1] stalk) was calculated
according to Ciampitti and Vyn (2012), following the equation
(Eq. 4):



WNC
RIE =
� SY



(4)
�



sugarcane yield versus the aboveground nutrient content and
stalk nutrient content for N, P, and K was assessed through nonlinear regressions. The model adjusted was validated utilizing
previously published studies (Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al.,
2010; Schultz et al., 2010) as to demonstrate the fitness and
robustness of model calibration. The relationship between N
content versus P and K content were also performed aimed to
evaluate the N:P and N:K ratios within each plant component. All
fitted regressions were determined using the SigmaPlot graphing
software (version 11.0, 2008, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA,
USA). The aboveground biomass accumulation, nutrient content,
NIE, and RIE values obtained from all sites were stratified into
diverse sugarcane yield ranges ( _<_ 80, 80–100, 100–120, 120–140,
140–160, and _>_ 160 Mg ha [−][1] ).


RESULTS


Weather Conditions

At the three sites, precipitation totals during the sugarcane
growing season (equivalent to 12 months) were above the local
average ( **Figure 1** ). At Site 1, precipitation reached 1,862 mm
and was 1.5-fold higher than the 81-year average (1,230 mm;
**Figure 1A** ); precipitation at Site 2 totaled 1,691 mm and was
1.3-fold greater than the 29-year average (1,330 mm; **Figure 1B** );
at Site 3, cumulative precipitation (1,310 mm) was slightly
superior than the 17-year average (1,266 mm; **Figure 1C** ). The
air temperatures recorded at each site ( **Figure 1** ) were similar
to historical average. At Site 1, minimum air temperature varied
from 9.5 to 20.0 [◦] C, while maximum air temperature ranged from
24.2 to 32.9 [◦] C. At Site 2, minimum air temperature ranged from
11.8 to 20.6 [◦] C, while maximum air temperature varied from 24.2
to 31.5 [◦] C. Lastly, at Site 3, minimum air temperature varied from
12.0 to 21.4 [◦] C, and maximum air temperature ranged from 25.7
to 34.7 [◦] C.


Biomass, Nutrient Content, and Harvest
Index

A broad range in aboveground sugarcane biomass was recorded
across all sites ( **Table 2** ). Sugarcane yield ranged from 67 to
211 Mg ha [−][1], averaging 125 Mg ha [−][1] . Aboveground biomass
ranged from 16 to 106 Mg ha [−][1], averaging 57 Mg ha [−][1] . Stalk
biomass ranged from 9 to 66 Mg ha [−][1], averaging 37 Mg ha [−][1],
while tops mass ranged from 2 to 30 Mg ha [−][1] and averaged 11 Mg
ha [−][1] . Dry leaves biomass ranged from 4 to 20 Mg ha [−][1], with
an average of 9 Mg ha [−][1] . Nutrient content within each plant
component also had a broad variation ( **Table 2** ). The content
of N, P, and K in the stalks ranged from 32 to 168 kg ha [−][1],
from 5 to 57 kg ha [−][1], and from 26 to 713 kg ha [−][1], respectively.
The content of N, P, and K in the dry leaves ranged from 19 to
77 kg ha [−][1], 0.6 to 4.9 kg ha [−][1], and 2 to 96 kg ha [−][1], respectively.
Lastly, the content of N, P, and K in the tops ranged from
17 to 225 kg ha [−][1], 1 to 26 kg ha [−][1], and 75 to 396 kg ha [−][1],
respectively. As related to the aboveground plant fractions (dry

Statistical Analysis
Although there were consistent differences among the three
N-response sites in terms of experimental conditions (e.g.,
nutrient rates applied, fertilizer sources, cultivars planted, etc.),
this study performs a synthesis analysis to provide general
information on nutrient content and partitioning, based on
varying sugarcane yield levels, regardless of evaluated factors
within each site. This approach was previously used by
Setiyono et al. (2010) for corn. For all the parameters studied,
descriptive statistics was determined through calculating mean,
standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 25–75% quartile.
The equations used to predict seasonal biomass and nutrient
partitioning (Eqs. 1 and 2) among plant components (stalks,
dry leaves, and tops) were chosen based on their higher _R_ [2]

values than other functions tested. The relationship between the

K content followed a similar trend related to the N content
( **Table 2** ), with values ranging between 159 and 866 kg K ha [−][1],
averaging 469 kg K ha [−][1] . The biomass HI had a narrow range,
varying from 0.55 to 0.73 across all evaluated sites ( **Table 2** ).
In contrast, nutrient HI showed a broad range, varying from
0.31 to 0.64 for N, 0.38 to 0.81 for P, and 0.12 to 0.82 for K.
Detailed results about biomass accumulation, nutrient content,
and HI for each specific treatment within each site can be found
in **Supplementary Table 1** .


Biomass and Nutrient Partitioning
Sugarcane biomass accumulation throughout the ratoon cycles
was characterized by a sigmoid pattern ( **Figure 2A** ). The nonlinear growth regression equation included data from all sites,
and three distinct growth phases were identified, as follows: (1)
Phase I (lag phase): from ∼0 to 135 DAH (0 to 1450 [◦] C GDDs),
this period is marked by a slow plant growth, accumulating
∼10% of the final aboveground biomass relative to harvest; (2)
Phase II (exponential–linear phase): from ∼135 to 270 DAH
(1450 to 2800 [◦] C GDDs), this period was characterized by a rapid
growth that produced ∼65% of the final aboveground biomass
relative to harvest; and (3) Phase III (stationary phase): from
∼270 to 370 DAH (2800 to 4000 [◦] C GDDs), this period exhibited
a declined growth, representing ∼25% of the final aboveground
biomass at harvest. As related to the nutrient uptake, 50% of



the total N, P, and K content occurred at 212 (2259 GDDs), 209
(2292 GDDs), and 214 DAH (2314 GDDs), respectively, while
50% of biomass accumulation was detected at 250 DAH (2700
GDDs; **Figures 2B–D** ). Thus, there was an asynchrony (delay) of
∼38 days, on average, between the date when 50% of the total
aboveground biomass occurred in comparison when 50% of total
nutrient had accumulated.
In the partitioning process, Phase I was marked by the biomass
allocation exclusively in the tops, as the occurrence of dried
leaves and stalk was not visible at that growth stage ( **Figure 2A** ).
However, an opposite trend was observed for Phases II and III,
where most of the biomass was allocated in the stalk, followed by
tops and dry leaves. The fraction of biomass allocated in the stalk
was ∼65% of the total, which are similar toother studies, ranging
from 60 to 80% (Coale et al., 1993; Inman-Bamber et al., 2002;
Shukla et al., 2009; Trivelin et al., 2013). The nutrient partitioning
followed the same trend as verified for biomass accumulation
( **Figures 2B–D** ), although a higher proportion of N, P, and K were
allocated in the tops than dry leaves in the Phases II and III.


Yield-to-Nutrient Content Relationship
Sugarcane Yield
Sugarcane yield was positively related to the aboveground and
stalk nutrient content, with a less than proportional change
for nutrient content under high-yielding stalk observations

( **Figure 3** ). Both N and P showed a narrow relationship with
sugarcane yield ( _R_ [2] ≥ 0.66), but K presented wider variability,
thus resulting in non-significant relationships ( _R_ [2] ≤ 0.13;
**Figures 3C,F** ). For the yield-to-K relationship, Site 1 showed
a range varying from 356 to 866 kg K ha [−][1] for a comparable
yield level ( **Figure 3C** ), whereas for Site 2, K and P may have
limited sugarcane yield with similar stalk K (70 kg ha [−][1] ) and P
(9 kg ha [−][1] ) content, with yield ranging from 65 to 120 Mg ha [−][1]

( **Figures 3E,F** ).


N:P and N:K Stoichiometry in Sugarcane
Plant Components
Evaluation of nutrient stoichiometry can provide an overall status
of nutrient balance at a specific growth stage. Following this
rationale, N:P ratio was established for all plant components
(stalk, dry leaves, and tops) at harvest time ( **Figure 4** ). Bubble
graphs portrayed N:P content association as relative to sugarcane
yield (represented by bubble sizes; **Figure 4** ). At the aboveground
biomass level, N:P ratio presented an overall balance close to 6:1
units ( **Figure 4A** ), although the N:P ratio changed relative to the
plant fraction: 18 units for dry leaves ( **Figure 4B** ), 6 unit for
tops ( **Figure 4C** ), and 4 units for the stalk organ ( **Figure 4D** ).
The tops followed a similar N:P ratio as documented for the
aboveground plant, which exemplify the critical role of this
organ for C fixation and growth/yield, with a variation from



3:1 to 11:1 ( _<_ threefold; **Figure 4C** ). High-yielding sugarcane
observations presented a more balanced N:P ratio (6:1 units).
For example, sugarcane yield of 120 Mg ha [−][1] resulted in 70 kg N
ha [−][1] and 12 kg P ha [−][1] (N:P of six units) for the tops component
( **Figure 4C** ).
The stoichiometric evaluation was also calculated for N and

K, but more variation was present than the N:P ratio. The overall
N:K ratio was of 0.5:1 units, ranging from 0.1:1 to 1.2:1 ( _>_ 10-fold
variation; **Supplementary Figure S1** ). Accordingly to the N:P
ratio, the N:K stoichiometry presented a similar variation range
in the tops component relative to the aboveground biomass.
Detailed information about nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K) for
treatments used at each site can be found in **Supplementary**
**Table 1** .


Efficiency Indexes on Diverse Sugarcane
Yield Ranges
As expected, both biomass and nutrient content followed
the yield pattern ( **Table 3** ). In low-yield levels, marked by
yields _<_ 80 Mg ha [−][1], the aboveground biomass was of 26 Mg
ha [−][1], whereas aboveground nutrient content was of 117, 16, and
233 kg ha [−][1] of N, P, and K, respectively. However, under highyield levels ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [−][1] ), the biomass was of 89 Mg ha [−][1],
while nutrient content was of 279, 50, and 560 kg ha [−][1] of N, P,
and K, respectively.

Sugarcane yield influenced all internal nutrient efficiencies for
N, P, and K ( **Table 3** ). Maximum NIEs [713 kg stalk kg [−][1] N,
5962 kg stalk kg [−][1] P, and 478 kg stalk kg [−][1] K] occurred at lowest
sugarcane yield ( _<_ 80 Mg ha [−][1] ), while minimum NIEs [623 kg
stalk kg [−][1] N, 3649 kg stalk kg [−][1] P, and 320 kg stalk kg [−][1] K]
occurred at highest sugarcane yield ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [−][1] ). Reciprocal
internal efficiencies were estimated for low and high sugarcane
yields (from 80 to 160 Mg ha [−][1] ), requiring 1.3–1.6 kg N, 0.21–
0.28 kg P, and 2.4–3.2 kg K per Mg of stalk produced, respectively
( **Table 3** ). Oliveira (2011) reported a similar trend for RIE, with
values of 1.5, 0.21, and 3.1 kg of N, P, and K, respectively.


DISCUSSION


The high yielding observations reported in this study were
greater than previous sugarcane yield values documented by
others researchers in Brazil (Gava et al., 2005; Prado and



Pancelli, 2008; Oliveira, 2011; Amaral and Molin, 2013; Fortes
et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Rossato et al., 2013), Australia
(Thorburn et al., 2011) and United States (Coale et al., 1993;
McCray et al., 2014). In this study, Site 3 represents a highyielding and productive sugarcane environment, likely explained
by the combination of high soil fertility and utilization of best
management practices, such as variable rate fertilizer spreader
and controlled traffic through GPS guided maps. It is recognized
that sugarcane yield depends on the complex interaction among
genotypes, environment (soil and weather), and management
practices (Thorburn et al., 2011). Several factors can contribute
to the scatter and non-linear differences in yield that affect
its relationship between nutrients (Setiyono et al., 2010). In
this study, weather conditions, such as air temperature and
precipitation, were similar for all sites ( **Figure 1** ), with a main
difference related to the soil type and fertility status ( **Table 1** ).
For example, in Site 1, average pH (4.3 units) and base saturation
(23%) were relatively low at all evaluated soil-depth intervals,

accompanied with high Al content (9.5 mmol c dm [−][3] ) when
compared to Site 3 ( **Table 1** ). For Site 2, the main limiting
factors were K (0.3 mmol c dm [−][3] ) and P (5.6 mg dm [−][3] ) levels.
In summary, Sites 1 and 2 presented initial soil conditions that
could constraint and severely affect sugarcane yield potential
relative to Site 3. In agreement, Dias et al. (1999), documented
a strong correlation between sugarcane yields and chemical
properties (e.g., CEC, base saturation, exchangeable Ca, Mg, and
Al, potential acidity, etc.) of subsurface horizons (25–150 cm) of
six weathered soils. Treatment effect was more pronounced on
Sites 1 and 2 than Site 3 ( **Supplementary Table 1** ), which was
likely due to variations in soil chemical properties as described
above.
Although the aboveground N content presented a broad
variation, the overall absolute value was similar with others
studies (Wood et al., 1996; Oliveira et al., 2010; Franco et al.,
2011). Wood et al. (1996) documented total N content values
ranging from 212 to 254 kg N ha [−][1] for several sugarcane
cultivars. Franco et al. (2011) found total N content values
ranging from 95 to 154 kg ha [−][1], while sugarcane yield ranged
between 77 and 122 Mg ha [−][1] at the same study sites (Franco
et al., 2015). Oliveira et al. (2010) reported that N content ranged
between 94 and 260 kg N ha [−][1], while sugarcane yield ranged
from 120 to 232 Mg ha [−][1] for 11 sugarcane cultivars under
irrigation in northeastern Brazil. Differences in N content could
be explained by the higher yields obtained in the present study
(average of 125 Mg ha [−][1] ). Other N sources rather than mineral
fertilizer (e.g., soil N mineralization, atmospheric deposition,



and biological N fixation by endophytic bacteria) can provide
different amount of N for sugarcane crop (Urquiaga et al., 2012;
Mariano et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Vieira-Megda et al., 2015).
For this study, aboveground P content presented a similar range
from 21 to 39 kg P ha [−][1] as reported by several researchers
(Rakkiyappan et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al.,
2010). As related to the K content, Coale et al. (1993) and Shukla
et al. (2009) reported lower values for K content removal by crop
harvest of 340 and 228 kg K ha [−][1] with sugarcane yield of 96 and
80 Mg ha [−][1], respectively. For our study, high K content might
have been influenced by the soil nutrient content presented at
Site 1, where soil K level was ≥4.0 mmol c dm [−][3] throughout the
soil profile ( **Table 1** ). This experimental site has a long history
of annual applications of vinasse and press mud. As vinasse has
a high K content, amendment of this by-product might have
gradually enriched soil K content (Resende et al., 2006). Thus,
scientific literature is available portraying the critical role of
sustaining an adequate K content for increasing sugarcane yields
(Shukla et al., 2009).
Under optimal water, solar radiation, and temperature
conditions, nutrient supply is the primary limiting factor
affecting the process of biomass accumulation (Donaldson et al.,
2008; van Heerden et al., 2010). For this study, a similar
biomass accumulation pattern was previously described by others
authors for plant cane and ratoon cycles for a broad range
of cultivars, soil characteristics, and environmental conditions
(Machado et al., 1982; Coale et al., 1993; Inman-Bamber et al.,
2002; Gava et al., 2005). Phase I comprised the growth and

phenology of sugarcane from emergence to 50% leaf production
(half of tops already formed; **Figure 2** ). The slow growth is
related to the slow tillering and leaf production during plant
establishment (Bell and Garside, 2005; Allison et al., 2007).
Phase II is characterized by an exponential–linear biomass
accumulation, consisting in leaf canopy and stalks production.
After canopy establishment, the sugarcane is high efficient in
converting intercepted light into biomass (Rae et al., 2005;
Allison et al., 2007). The last stage (Phase III) is marked by
the crop ripening and consequent sucrose accumulation in the
stalk organ. Low air temperatures, reduced precipitation, and
low-light photoperiod are important factors for the sugarcane
ripening (Inman-Bamber et al., 2002; Cardozo and Sentelhas,
2013). At all sites, nutrients were accumulated in a linear
fashion approach during Phase II as related to the potential
yield production in each environment. However, in mid-point
of Phase III, there was a decrease in the N and K content
for all components (stalks, tops, and dry leaves; **Figure 2** ).
Thus, we have two hypothesis for this nutrient changes close
to physiological maturity (ripening): (1) nutrient remobilization
from aboveground plant components to belowground organs,
such as roots and rhizomes (Andersson et al., 2005; Lim et al.,
2007); and (2) specific to N allocated in the tops and dry
leaves, foliar emissions of ammonia via stomata can occur
during the leaf senescence, reducing the N content in plant
tissues (Britto and Kronzucker, 2002; Epstein and Bloom,
2005).
Dissection of plant components for studying biomass HI
is critical for understanding efficiency and potential yield for
sugarcane. Inman-Bamber et al. (2002) suggested that the
biomass HI (stalks to the aboveground biomass ratio) might
be variable due to the amounts of straw (dry leaves and tops)
recovered during the sampling procedure of sugarcane age field.
In this investigation, dry leaves and tops comprised sugarcane
straw, whereas tops are the plant component that accumulates
the greatest amounts of nutrients (∼60% N, ∼75% P, and
∼80% K) as compared to dry leaves ( **Figure 2** ; **Table 2** ).
According to Trivelin et al. (2013), since dry leaves have low
nutrient content, tops is a critical plant component that should
remain as a crop residue to sustain long-term soil fertility.
However, excessive stalk lodging in sugarcane fields (caused by



high yields and winds) may lead to low return of the tops
as straw component, since the whole plant is processed by
the harvester rather than prior cutting of tops and its direct
deposition on the ground. In this scenario, contribution of
nutrients released from the straw for sugarcane nutrition can
be less significant. From the nutrient HI results ( **Table 2** ), the
N replacement concept (Thorburn et al., 2011), based on the
fertilizer N application to replace the N removed from the
system (stalk harvested), is a promising way to recommend
fertilizer needs for sugarcane not only for N, but also for
P and K. This approach may deliver superior environmental
outcome without reducing sugarcane yield. However, as HI
was not constant for any nutrient (ranging from 0.12 to 0.82,
considering N, P, and K), future research on robust models
for optimizing the replacement concept is needed (Setiyono
et al., 2010). Low nutrient HIs for sugarcane should be
considered as a better plant trait, in opposite to the biomass
partitioning (HI), since more nutrients are retained in nonharvested plant components (straw) and then released to
the soil through leaching (for K) and mineralization (for N
and P).
Nutrient-yield relationships for N and P presented a narrowed
variation for both stalks and aboveground plant relative to
K variation on those plant organs ( **Figure 3** ). Potassium is
the most important nutrient in the osmoregulation process,
which is important for cell extension and stomata movement
(Shukla et al., 2009; Kingston, 2014). We can speculate that
the tops (functional leaves) have kept more balanced nutrient
ratios for metabolic functions (Groot et al., 2003; Güsewell,
2004). Nutrient surplus (e.g., Site 1, with high K content in
the soil) can be storage in other component (stalk organ),
presenting a low N:K ratio (0.09:1) than tops (functional
leaves; **Supplementary Figure 1** ). In corn, Ciampitti and Vyn
(2014) documented a more balanced N:P (5:1) and N:K
(1:1) ratios under high-yielding environments. In a review
analysis, Sadras (2006) showed consistent N:P ratio differences
among grain crops, 4:1 for oilseed, 6:1 for cereal, and 9:1
for legume. Similar N:P ratio, 5:1 units, was synthesized by
Ciampitti and Vyn (2014), in a historical and global analysis
performed for corn crop. On the opposite side, dry leaves (less
functional tissues) presented the largest N:P ratio, 18:1 units

(ranging from 6:1 to 51:1 units; **Figure 4D** ). Sugarcane yield
influence was not clearly individualized for the N:P ratio of
dry leaves, but lower nutrient content was observed in this
plant component with a larger reduction on P (fivefold) in
relation to N (twofold) when compared with the tops organ
( **Figures 4B,C** ). A higher N:P ratio in dry leaves is explained
by the remobilization of nucleic-acid P to young leaves and
the lower P demand of mature tissues (Usuda, 1995; Güsewell,
2004).
A balanced nutrient approach is critical to sustain functional
tissues and to promote C fixation, growth, and increase sugar
content in the sugarcane production (Allison et al., 1997, 2007;
Zhao et al., 2014). From our study, nutrient content have a
broad range of variability related to stalk yield levels ( **Table 3** ).
For example, aboveground N, P, and K contents ranged from
117–280, 16–50, and 233–560 kg ha [−][1], respectively, from low
(≤80 Mg ha [−][1] ) and high yielding sites ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [−][1] ),
respectively. Nutrient internal efficiencies can be described as
the ability of a plant to transform nutrients acquired from all
sources (e.g., soil, fertilizer, and atmosphere) into economic yield
(Cassman et al., 2002; Dobermann, 2007; Ciampitti and Vyn,
2014), in this case represented as sugarcane yield. The higher
values of NIE found in low-yielding environments represents
a dilution of that nutrient in the plant, and is related to its
deficiency. In contrast, low values of NIE observed in highyielding environments represent an accumulation of that nutrient
in the plant, and two hypothesis may explain this pattern,
as follows: to (1) a restriction in its internal utilization due
to other limiting factors; and (2) an excessive uptake (also
termed as “luxury consumption”) of K, beyond the amount
required for stalk production (Setiyono et al., 2010). Similar
results as obtained in this investigation were reported by
Setiyono et al. (2010) and Ciampitti et al. (2013) for corn,
with lowest NIEs as the crop was reaching high-yield potential.
The RIE values reported here are ( **Table 3** ) similar but higher
from those documented by Silva and Casagrande (1983) and
Gopalasundaram et al. (2012), which ranged from 0.56–1.20 kg
N, 0.13–0.35 kg P, and 0.6–1.9 kg K per Mg of stalk produced.
Lower nutrient requirements presented in previous studies are
associated to low yield levels, coupled to interactions among
genotype, environment, and management (Dias et al., 1999;
Thorburn et al., 2011; Gopalasundaram et al., 2012). From the
soil perspective, nutrient availability can limit crop acquisition,
thus leading to lower biomass and stalk production ( **Table 1**,
**Figure 3** ). In high productivity systems, fertilization of N, P, and
K is essential to replenish stalk nutrient removal in order to
sustainably maintain high yield levels. Therefore, soil test remains
as a powerful diagnostic tool to quantify nutrient availability
and subsequent fertilizer needs (McCray et al., 2014). In Brazil,
however, N recommendation for sugarcane is based on the target
yield concept (Cantarella et al., 1998), where soil N supply, the
main source of N to the crop (Franco et al., 2011), is entirely
neglected. Thus, a soil testing capable to predict _in situ_ N
mineralization in sugarcane fields is critically needed.
In summary, nutrient ratios can provide useful information
for sugarcane growers as related to understanding crop nutrient
balances and improving fertility diagnosing systems. To extend



of our knowledge, this study is the first one in synthesizing
data in nutrient ratios and yield potential for sugarcane crop.
A main constraint on this analysis is related to when the data
was collected, all at harvest time, which it did not allow the
utilization of this information for in-season fertility management.
A temporal analysis on nutrient ratios involving multiple inseason sampling times is needed in order to provide timely
information on nutrient management recommendations for
sugarcane crop. Future research should be focus on connecting
soil and plant processes for identifying the main factors not only
affecting nutrient ratios but also their relationship to the yield and
plant biomass components.


CONCLUSION


Seasonal biomass accumulation presented three growth
phases (lag, exponential–linear, and stationary) during the
ratoon growing season. In overall, improvement in stalk
yields was tightly connected to superior aboveground biomass
accumulation. Additionally, high yielding sugarcane was
correlated with higher nutrient content, more balanced and
narrowed nutrient ratios, and higher efficiency in producing
each unit of stalk per unit of nutrient accumulated. The nutrient
partitioning evaluation portrayed lower nutrient (N, P, and K)
content in the dry leaves fraction but with a high N:P ratio
relative to the top plant component. Greater sugarcane yield and
narrowed N:P ratio (6:1) were documented for tops fraction as N
and P content increased.
Stalk yield gap can be closed by better balancing nutrient ratios
that can be achieved by better understanding complex plant-soil
pathways related to nutrient uptake and plant utilization. This
synthesis analysis not only provides a descriptive summary on
the variation of nutrient ratios at harvest at varying sugarcane
yield levels, but also established a foundational concept on
investigating nutrient ratios by dissecting plant components.
From a pragmatic standpoint, further research is needed
for integrating the replacement concept in decision nutrient
management support tools for assisting sugarcane producers on
the farming decision-making process.
