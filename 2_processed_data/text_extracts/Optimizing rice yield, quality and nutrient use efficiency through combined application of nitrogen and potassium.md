Reasonable nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) application rates can effectively improve
fertilizer use efficiency, rice yield and quality. A two-year field experiment was
conducted with combined application of three N rates (135, 180, and 225 kg ha [-1],
denoted as N1-N3) and four K rates (0, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha [-1], denoted as K0-K3)
using super indica hybrid rice cultivar Yixiangyou (YXY) 2115 to explore the effects of

co-application of N and K on rice growth and development. The results indicated
that the combined application of N and K had significantly interactive effects on dry
matter (DM) accumulation, nutrients absorption, N harvest index (NHI), K harvest
index (KHI), spikelets per panicle and most rice quality indexes. The highest total DM
accumulation (17998.17-19432.47 kg ha [-1] ) at maturity stage was obtained under

N3K2. The effect of co-application of N and K on nutrients absorption and

utilization varied between the two years and within each year. The highest total
N and K accumulations at maturity stage were observed under N3K1 and N3K2,
respectively, while the highest N recovery efficiency (NRE) and K recovery efficiency
(KRE) were observed under N1K3. High expression levels of N and K metabolism
related genes in rice grains were observed under N3K2 or N3K3, consistent with N
and K uptake. Co-application of N and K increased rice yield significantly and the
highest yield (6745.02-7010.27 kg ha [-1] ) was obtained under N2K2. As more N was

gradually applied, rice appearance quality improved but milling, cooking and eating

quality decreased. Although appropriate application of K could improve rice milling,

cooking and eating quality, it reduced appearance quality. The optimal

milling, cooking and eating quality were obtained under N1K2, while the best
appearance quality was obtained under N3K0. Overall, a combination of 135-210 kg
ha [-1] N and 115-137 kg ha [-1] K application rates was recommended for achieving

relatively higher yield and better quality in rice production.

## 1 Introduction

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) stands as a primary global food, with
China playing a prominent role as both a major producer and
consumer of this essential crop. Over half of China’s population
relies on rice as their staple food. Consequently, the advancement of
rice production holds paramount significance in meeting the living
needs of population and ensuring food security (Karthika et al.,
2023). Nowadays, fertilizers have evolved into the principle source
of soil nutrient provision. The enhancement of crop yield is
inseparable from the application of chemical fertilizers, no
exception for rice production. Approximately 30-50% of global
increase in crop yield can be attributed to fertilizer input (Erisman
et al., 2008), while the increase rate for rice yield can attain a notable
57.4% (Wang et al., 2010a).
N and K are essential nutrients for rice growth and
development, and play important roles in the determination of
both yield and quality. The amount of N input in rice production in
China significantly surpasses the global average level (Ludemann
et al., 2022). However, there is a discernible decline in the utilization

rate of N, possibly attributed to the persistent escalation of N
application rates (Ju et al., 2015). The application rate of N in rice
production in southwest China reaches approximately 180 kg ha [-1],
yet the absorption and utilization rate of N hovers between 32-37%
(Zhang et al., 2015). However, due to the more apparent immediate
effects of N fertilizer application, it is a prominent problem that the
preference for higher N inputs over the combined application of N
and K in Chinese rice production (Li, 2017). In contrast to N, the
application of K in rice production is often insufficient. Rice is a
crop that requires a high amount of K, with an uptake ranging from
150-300 kg ha [-1] per season, comparable to or even exceeding the N
uptake (Xu et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2019). Improper application of
fertilizer will lead to the diminished nutrients utilization efficiency,
yield reduction, deterioration of rice quality and environmental
pollution, which may have the potential to impact human living
condition and the sustainable development of agriculture and
ecology (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Hence, the efficiency
of fertilizer absorption and utilization after application, as well as
optimization of fertilization methods, should be taken into
consideration to mitigate the adverse impacts associated

with fertilization.

The hybrid indica rice cultivar Yixiangyou 2115 is currently
extensively cultivated in southwest China, acclaimed for its high
quality, substantial yield and resistance to multiple stresses. It was
identified as “Super Rice” in 2015 by the Ministry of Agriculture. So
far, it has been widely promoted and applied for more than 1.3
million hectares and become a representative cultivar of hybrid rice

in China. However, limited studies can be found on the cultivation

techniques aimed at achieving both high yield and high quality for
this specific rice cultivar. N and K have certain regulatory effects on
rice growth and development. The rational application of N and K
can significantly enhance fertilizer utilization efficiency, thereby
positively influencing both rice yield and quality. The phenomenon
of heavy application of N with a comparably lighter application of K



is common due to the relative lower cost of N fertilizer and the

established fertilization habits, which leads to high yield but low
efficiency in rice production. Numerous studies have explored the
individual effects of N or K on rice growth and development. A
comprehensive understanding of the combined effects of N and K
on nutrient absorption, utilization, as well as their impact on rice
yield and quality, remains an area requiring further systematic
investigation. Therefore, field experiments were conducted with
combined application of three N rates (135, 180, and 225 kg ha [-1] )
and four K rates (0, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha [-1] ) using super indica
hybrid rice cultivar YXY 2115 to explore the interactive effects of N
and K on rice nutrients absorption and utilization, yield and quality.
The objective of this study was to clarify the optimal ration of N and
K conducive to achieving both high yield and high quality for YXY
2115. Also, the expression levels of N and K metabolism-related key
genes OsNRT1.1B, OsAMT2;1, OsNR2, OsHAK1, OsHAK5 and
OsAKT1 were quantified to assess the molecular response of rice
grains to different fertilizer application rates. This study was
expected to provide a theoretical basis for the optimization and
improvement of cultivation methods to achieve high yield, high
quality, and reduce fertilizer input for rice production in southwest
China, as well as the large-scale promotion and application of

this cultivar.

## 2 Materials and methods


2.1 Experimental site and materials


Field experiments were conducted during the growing seasons
of 2019 and 2020 at the research farm of Sichuan Agricultural
University, Wenjiang city, Sichuan Province, China (30°70′ N, 103°
83′ E). The soil of the plot was clay soil. Prior to the establishment of
the field experiment, soil samples from the topsoil layer (0-0.20 m)
were analyzed. The climate data and analysis results of the top soil
layer were shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively. During rice
growth period in two years, the daily average temperature and

rainfall were 22.78 °C and 3.69 mm in 2019, and 23.31 °C and 6.53

mm in 2020, respectively. Super indica hybrid rice cultivar
Yixiangyou 2115 (Sichuan Agricultural University), which is
widely cultivated in southwest China with high yield and quality
with the whole growth period of 146 days, was chosen and used as

the test material.


2.2 Experimental design


Two factor factorial field trials with three levels of N and four
levels of K were conducted in two years, using a randomized
complete block design with three replicates. Twelve treatments
were established by the complete combination of three N
application rates (135, 180 and 225 kg ha [-1], denoted as N1, N2
and N3, respectively) and four K application rates (0, 90, 135 and
180 kg ha [-1], denoted as K0, K1, K2 and K3, respectively). No

nitrogen application treatment was established and used to calculate
the nutrients absorption and utilization only.
Seeds were sown on 12 April 2019 and 14 April 2020, and the
seedlings were transplanted on 27 May 2019 and 26 May 2020,
and rice was harvested on 19 Sept 2019 and 20 Sept 2020,
respectively. The area of each test plot was 5.0 m×5.0 m, and
the transplant density was 30 cm×25 cm (row spacing × plant
spacing) with one seedling per hill. Urea (N, 46.4%) was used as
the N source, superphosphate (P 2 O 5, 12.0%) was used as the
phosphorus (P) source, and potassium chloride (K 2 O, 60.0%) was
used as the K source. N fertilizer was used as basal manure and top
dressing (twenty days after transplanting) at a 6:4 ratio. Basal N, P
(90 kg ha [-1] ) and K were applied to the soil one day before
transplanting. For the fertilizer treatments, ridges with plastic
film were used for separation, and protection lines were

established between the treatment blocks to ensure the isolation

of the experimental plots. During the whole growing season, rice
was continuously flooded with the river water. Field management,
including the prevention and control of pests and weeds, was
conducted according to the local cultural practices.


2.3 Measurements and methods


2.3.1 Dry matter accumulation
Ten representative hills were sampled from each plot based on
the average number of tillers at full heading stage (9 Aug 2019 and
13 Aug 2020) and maturity stage (14 Sept 2019 and 15 Sept 2020),
respectively. Samples were then separated into different parts, and
were oven-dried at 105°C for 30 min and then to constant weight at



80°C to determine the dry weight. DM of stem-sheath, leaf, panicle,

and total biomass were recorded.


2.3.2 Absorption and utilization efficiency of N
and K

After weighted, all dried samples were ground to make powder,
passed through a 0.20 mm sieve, and digested with a mixture of
concentrated H 2 SO 4 and H 2 O 2 to determine N and K

concentrations. The N concentration was determined using a
continuous flow analyzer (AA3, Seal Analytical Inc.,
Southampton, UK) while K was determined using flame
photometer (M-410, Sherwood Scientific Ltd., Cambridge, UK).
The nutrients absorption and utilization efficiency were analyzed as

2.3.3 RNA isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA samples were obtained from rice grains at midfilling stage (15 days after flowering) using RNA Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using Revertase Transcription kit (Nanjing Vazyme
Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). The products
were quantified using a real-time PCR detection system, following
the manufacturer’s instructions (SYBR Green Master Mix,

Vazyme). The rice Actin gene was used as an internal control.
Treatment without nitrogen fertilizer was used as CK. The PCR
primers used were listed in Supplementary Table S5.


2.3.4 Yield and yield components
Rice was harvested at maturity stage and the yield in each
experimental plot was recorded after measuring moisture content
and removing impurities. Grain yield was adjusted to a moisture
content of 13.5%. The number of effective tillers per hill was
determined before harvest using 30 plants per plot. A total of 10
selected plants were separated into single tillers according to the
marked date, and were used to measure 1000-grain weight, seedsetting rate, and filled grain number per panicle.


2.3.5 Rice quality
At harvest, 10 plants from each plot were sampled randomly
and allowed to dry naturally in the sun to assess rice milling quality,
appearance quality, eating quality and rapid visco-analyzer (RVA)
value after the material was stored at room temperature for

3 months.


2.3.5.1 Milling quality
About 100.0 g rice grains were processed using a rice huller
(JLG-2118, Taizhou Food Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) to
obtain brown rice. The brown rice was polished using a rice milling
machine (JNMJ-3, Taizhou Food Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang,
China) to obtain milled rice. In order to obtain head rice, grain with
a length longer than 3/4 of its total length was separated from the
milled rice using a broken rice separator (FQS-13X20, Taizhou
Food Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China). The brown rice, milled



rice, and head rice are expressed as percentages of the total
grain weight.


2.3.5.2 Appearance quality
The grain length, width, length/width, chalkiness rate and
chalkiness degree were determined using a grain appearance
analyzer (JMWT12, Dongfu Jiuheng Instrument Technology Co.,
Ltd., Beijing, China).


2.3.5.3 Rapid visco-analyzer value
A 3.00 g sample and 25.0 mL of distilled water were added to a
test tube. Pasting properties were measured using an RVA device
(3-D, Newport Scientific, Sydney, Australia) and analyzed with
Thermal Cycle for Windows software. Viscosity values were
measured in a rapid viscosity analyzer unit (RVU).


2.3.5.4 Eating quality
The sensory properties of the cooked rice were measured using
a rice sensory analyzer (STA 1B, Satake Asia Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). Milled rice (30.00 g) was washed in a stainless-steel

container and then transferred into a 50 mL aluminum box

containing 40 mL of water. The milled rice was cooked in a
multifunctional, timed food steamer (GF-339, Goodway Electrical
Enterprise Ltd., Hong Kong, China). After the cooking, the sensory
properties of the cooked rice were determined. Cooked rice texture
properties were measured using a rice texture analyzer (RHS 1A,
Satake Asia Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).


2.4 Statistical analysis


Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA),
and means were compared based on the least significant difference
(LSD) test at the 0.05 probability level by using SPSS 25.0 (Statistical
Product and Service Solutions Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The
assumptions of variance analysis were tested by ensuring that the
residuals were random, homogenous, with a normal distribution
about/above a mean of zero (Ali et al., 2013; Abolfazl et al., 2017).

Origin Pro 2020 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) was used to
draw the figures. Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) was used
to establish the binary quadratic fitting equation and figures.

## 3 Results


3.1 Dry matter accumulation


DM accumulation in the aboveground organs of rice could be
enhanced by increasing N application, and could be further
increased by applying appropriate K application at high N level
(Figure 2). The maximum values of DM accumulation in stemsheath, leaf and panicle were observed under N3 at both full
heading stage and maturity stage. Compared with other

treatments, the maximum increases of total DM accumulation

were obtained under N3K2, which were 57.54-66.62% at maturity
stage. Variance analysis showed that co-application of N and K had
extremely significant interactive effects on the DM accumulation in

Chen et al. [10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744)



the aboveground organs of rice (except panicle at full heading stage)
(Supplementary Table S1).


3.2 Uptake of N and K


Increasing application of N could improve the uptake of both N
and K (except K uptake in stem-sheath and leaf in 2020). The
uptake of N and K could be further increased by applying
appropriate K application, with a more obvious effect observed at
high N level (Figures 3, 4). Co-application of N and K had extremely
significant interactive effects on the uptake of N and K in the
aboveground organs of rice (Supplementary Table S2). The highest
uptakes of N and K in stem-sheath, leaf and panicle were observed
under N3 at both full heading stage and maturity stage.
At maturity stage, the maximum increases were obtained under
N3K1 (48.20%) in 2019 and N3K2 (91.29%) in 2020 for the total

uptake of N, and under N3K2 (176.30%) in 2019 and N3K1
(88.21%) in 2020 for the total uptake of K, respectively, when
compared with other treatments.


3.3 Use efficiency of N and K


No obvious and consistent changes were observed in the
response of N and K use efficiency indexes to the combined



application of N and K in two years test results. NRE decreased
but KHI increased with increasing N levels. Although the
application of K could increase NRE, NAE, NCR and KCR within
a certain range, it resulted in a decrease KAE (Tables 2, 3). Variance
analysis showed that co-application of N and K had extremely
significant interactive effects only on recovery efficiency and harvest

index of N and K.

Compared with other treatments, the maximum increases were
obtained under N1K3 (193.30-236.86%) in both years for NRE, and
under N1K3 (442.90%) in 2019 and N3K1 (1664.63%) in 2020 for

KRE. And the maximum increases were obtained under N3K1

(19.44%) in 2019 and N3K3 (31.47%) in 2020 for NHI, and under

N3K0 (171.06%) in 2019 and N3K1 (121.91%) in 2020 for KHI.


3.4 Expression of N and K metabolismrelated genes


Six genes were selected for analysis in response to the different
fertilizer application rates in hybrid rice cultivar YXY 2115,
considering their significant roles in N and K metabolism. The

results showed that OsNRT1.1B, OsNR2, OsHAK1, OsHAK5 and

OsAKT1 had high expression level under high application rates of
both N and K except OsAMT2;1, which were consistent with the
above results of N and K uptake (Figure 5). The peak expression

levels of OsNRT1.1B and OsAMT2;1 were obtained under N3K1

fertilizer level. Different lowercase (uppercase) letters in the same color column mean the significant difference between treatments at p < 0.05. The
data presented are the mean ± standard deviation, n = 3.

and N3K0, respectively. OsNR2 and OsHAK5 got their highest
expression levels under N3K2. Meanwhile, OsHAK1 and OsAKT1
achieved the highest expression levels under N3K3.


3.5 Yield and yield components


With increasing N levels, grain yield (GY), panicle number
(PN) and spikelet per panicle (SP) increased, while seed setting rate
(SR) showed the opposite trend. No significant difference was found
in 1000-grain weight (GW) among different treatments. The
combination of appropriate N levels with a high K level could
further improve yield and yield components (Table 4). Variance
analysis showed that co-application of N and K had extremely
significant interactive effects on SP. The highest GY, PN and SP
were observed under N3. Compared with other treatments, the

maximum increases of GY and SR were obtained under N2K2

(3.27-5.61%) and N1K3 (16.32-20.53%), respectively. And the
maximum increases were obtained under N2K3 (117.97%) in

2019 and N3K3 (39.06%) in 2020 for PN, and under N3K2

(29.10%) in 2019 and N2K3 (30.78%) in 2020 for SP.

Regression analysis of N and K application rates and yield was
carried out. By establishing a binary quadratic equation, the
fertilizer response function equation between N and K application



rates and yield was obtained.


Y 2019 = −0:0179N [2] +7:4833N−0:0112K [2] +3:0036K+0:0003NK+5944:5694


Y 2020 = −0:0159N [2] +7:3209N−0:0062K [2] +2:8293K−0:0067NK+5833:8396


Here: Y represents the yield (kg ha [-1] ), N represents the nitrogen
application rate (kg ha [-1] ), K represents the potassium application
rate (kg ha [-1] ).
The results showed that the relationship between N and K
application rates and yield could be described by binary quadratic
equations, with each index exhibiting a maximum value (Figure 6).
Considering both economic benefits and yield, in conjunction with
the fertilizer response function equation, the optimal yield reached
6936.58 kg ha [-1] in 2019. The recommended application rates for N
and K were 210.18 kg ha [-1] and 136.90 kg ha [-1], respectively. In 2020,
the highest yield achieved was 6750.54 kg ha [-1] in 2020, with the
suggested application rates of N and K being 205.98 kg ha [-1] and
115.02 kg ha [-1], respectively.


3.6 Rice quality


The application of N could improve rice appearance quality, but
decreased milling quality, as well as cooking and eating quality.

Conversely, the application of K had the opposite effect. Coapplication of N and K had extremely significant interactive effects
on various rice quality indexes, including milled rice rate (MR), head
rice rate (HR), chalkiness rate (CR), chalkiness degree (CD), peak
viscosity (PV), breakdown viscosity (BV), setback viscosity (SV) and
taste value (TV) (Tables 5, 6). The complete data for rice cooking and



eating quality is available in Supplementary Tables S1, S2. However,
there were no obvious changes in the response of RVA profile
characters to the combined application of N and K. The highest

MR, HR and TV were observed under N1, while the lowest CR and

CD were observed under N1. The optimal rice milling quality and
cooking and eating quality were obtained under N1K2, while the best

## 4 Discussion


4.1 Nutrient uptake and use efficiency


The growth of rice and the formation of rice yield are closely
linked to nutrient uptake. Studies have reported that the



accumulation of DM increased with increasing N levels (Sun,
2019), and the N accumulation of rice all increased at each

growth stage (Tang et al., 2019). The combined application of N
and K could significantly alleviate the limitations to photosynthesis,
especially the biological constraints (Hou et al., 2018). In the present
study, the DM accumulation of each vegetative organ in the
aboveground part of YXY 2115 increased with increasing N levels
at both full heading stage and maturity stage. Notably, the uptakes
of N and K in stem-sheaths and leaves decreased, while showing a
significantly increase in panicles, in agreement with the previous
studies (Li et al., 2014; Yan, 2018; Jiang et al., 2020). Compared with

14.79-18.64%%. As more N was gradually applied, the uptakes of N
and K in stem-sheaths, leaves and panicles all increased. Compared
with N1, the total uptake of N and K under N3 at maturity stage
increased by 5.89-24.94%% and 17.68-40.99%, respectively. The
enhancement of N and K uptake could be further optimized
through the appropriate application of K, with a more



pronounced effect observed under high N levels. However, the
DM accumulation showed a trend of first increasing and then
decreasing with increasing K under moderate and higher N levels,
indicating that while appropriate application of K under high N
levels increased DM accumulation, excessively high N and K levels
may hinder this process. This phenomenon might be attributed to
the decrease in leaf Rubisco enzyme activity under high N levels,

subsequently limiting the photosynthetic N use efficiency (Li, 2011).
Correlation analysis is statistical method that is used to discover if
there is a relationship between two variables, and how strong that
relationship may be. Hence, correlation analysis was conducted on
indexes that were relatively important in terms of rice nutrient
absorption and utilization, yield, and quality, as well as those
exhibiting significant interactive effects when N and K were
applied together. Correlation analysis showed that GY was
significantly positively correlated with TDA, TNA and TKA at
maturity stage (Figure 7). These results indicated that rational coapplication of N (225 kg ha [-1] ) and K (90-135 kg ha [-1] ) could
promote the N and K uptake and the N and K accumulation in



the aboveground parts, thereby maintaining or increasing yield. As
DM accumulation forms the foundation for rice yield. Taken
together, high N levels (180-225 kg ha [-1] ) combined with
appropriate application of K (135 kg ha [-1] ) could not only mitigate
fertilizer waste but also facilitate the establishment of a high-yield
population in rice production.
Fertilizer use efficiency is an important indicator for assessing
the transportation and distribution of nutrients in plant organs
(Zhou et al., 2020). The application rate of N has a significant effect

on NRE, NAE and NHI. As N levels increased, N accumulation in
rice increased significantly. However, the proportion of N in
panicles decreased while its proportion in stem-sheaths increased,

resulting in a decrease in NRE, NAE and NHI (Dong et al., 2015;
Cheng et al., 2018). K has been observed to enhance the activities of
nitrate reductase and aminotransferases, indicating a positive role of
K in N metabolism (Ahanger et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016). In our
study, as more N was gradually applied, NRE decreased and KHI
increased. Simultaneously, NRE, NAE, NCR and KCR increased,
while KAE decreased with increasing K at the same N level. The
observed changes in nutrients use efficiency and yield aligned with
the principle of diminishing returns for fertilizer (Lu, 2003). Most
researchers addressed that the application of N within a certain
range could lead to a decrease in NRE, which was consistent with
our results. However, variations in other indexes in the two-year
field experiments were either inconsistent or not conspicuous,
which differed with the results of previous studies. This might be



related to the unique characteristics of the YXY 2115 cultivar. The
varying sensitivity of different rice cultivars to N and K could
potentially be a key factor affecting fertilizer absorption and
utilization (Qiu et al., 2016), necessitating further research for a
comprehensive understanding.


4.2 Expression of N and K metabolismrelated genes


There are two main pathways through which plants acquire
nutrients: direct nutrient absorption, where plant roots directly
assimilate nutrients via ion channels or transporters from the soil;
and indirect nutrient absorption, through which plants obtain

nutrients from the environment through symbiosis with
microorganisms (Chu et al., 2021). However, researches on the
expression of genes related to N and K metabolism are mainly

focused on rice roots, shoots, stems and leaves.
Previous studies have identified LOC_Os10g40600 as encoding
a nitrate transporter NRT1.1B which has been demonstrated to
mediate nitrate signal transduction. In this study, the expression
level of OsNRT1.1B in rice grains increased as more N was gradually
applied, while the impact of K application rate on OsNRT1.1B
expression was limited (Figure 5A). These findings provided
evidence that NRT1.1B expression was substantially induced by
nitrate and was directly involved in nitrate uptake and nitrate
transport (Hu et al., 2015). Ammonium uptake from the soil
solution is mediated by ammonium transporters, such as the
OsAMT2;1 gene, which encodes a functional ammonium
transporter and is a key gene in ammonium ion absorption
pathway. It has been reported that the expression level of
OsAMT2;1 in rice cultivars with different N use efficiency varied
under different N application rates. High N use efficiency rice
cultivar showed higher gene expression levels in leaves under low
N application levels (Yang, 2021). However, no obviously changes
were observed in OsAMT2;1 expression level in rice grains under
different N and K application rates, except for N3K0, which requires
further study (Figure 5B). Nitrate reductase (NR) is an important
enzyme in plant N metabolism, playing a key role in N absorption
and utilization. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two members of NR
gene family in rice genome, NR1 and NR2, with over 70% similarity
between their protein sequences (Zhao, 2010). During the grain
filling process, NR activity in leaves first increased and then
decreased. The activity of NR increased with increasing N levels



(Lan, 2022). Consistent with this trend, the present study found that
the expression level of OsNR2 in rice grains increased with
increasing N levels, and could be further enhanced by applying
appropriate K application at high N levels (Figure 5C).
K plays irreplaceable roles in plant growth and development.
The KUP/HAK/KT family, with the largest family members and
diverse functions, is involved in nutrient metabolism, growth
regulation and stress tolerance (Chai et al., 2019). Studies suggest
that OsHAK1, OsHAK5, and OsAKT1 are crucial for K [+] uptake at
both low and high concentrations, as well as for K [+] translocation
from root to shoot. OsHAK1 and OsAKT1 exhibit high expression
levels in all cell types of roots and low levels in shoots (Manuel et al.,
2016). Additionally, the transcription levels of HAK genes are
regulated by the level of K nutrition. Overexpressing HAK1 or
HAK5 in rice and maize increased K [+] uptake, thereby increasing
grain yield (Qin et al., 2019). In our studies, higher expression levels
of OsHAK1, OsHAK5, and OsAKT1 in rice grains were observed

under N3K2 or N3K3, which were consistent with the above results

of K uptake, indicating that a high N application level combined
with a high K application level was beneficial to K absorption in rice
(Figures 5D–F).


4.3 Effects of co-application N and K on
rice yield and quality


Different N application patterns need to be combined with
appropriate application of K to achieve optimal yields. Excessive
application of either N or K not only results in fertilizer waste and
environment pollution but also decrease fertilizer use efficiency



[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 13 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)


Chen et al. [10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744)



(Wang et al., 2010b). Our results were corroborated with previous
studies indicating that rice yield exhibited an incremental trend
with increasing N application. However, beyond a certain threshold
of N application, the yield increase became statistically insignificant
(Hu et al., 2012). Over a two-year field experiment, our results
demonstrated that co-application of N and K yielded a higher rice
output compared to sole application of either N or K. These results
indicated that appropriate combined application of N (180 kg ha [-1] )
and K (135 kg ha [-1] ) could not only improve GY but also reduced the
fertilizer input. However, an increase in K application did not
exhibit a pronounced effect on the improvement of yield at the
same N level. Correlation analysis showed that GY was significantly
positively correlated with PN and SP (Figure 7), indicating that the
increase of PN and SP might be the primary factors contributing to
the increased GY from N and K application (Yang and Zhang,
2011). Furthermore, the positive impact of K application on rice
yield components might be attributed to its promotion of root
development, subsequently enhancing nutrient uptake by plants.
Despite N application leading to a decrease in seed setting rate (SR),
K application had a counteractive effect, compensating for the
overall grain yield formation. The decrease in SR might be

attributed to the substantial enhancement of PN and SP induced

by N application, expanding the capacity of “sink” rapidly.
Nevertheless, the grain filling process could not be carried out or
complete timely due to the limited supply of “source”, which in turn
led to the decrease in SR (Sun et al., 2012).

It is widely reported that reasonable application of N can reduce
CR and CD of rice, thus improving the appearance quality of rice
(Zhang, 2017). And the appropriate application of K under
conditions that meet the N requirements for rice growth can
effectively increase HR and reduce CR and CD, thereby
enhancing both the milling quality and appearance quality of rice
(Zhang et al., 2018). Besides, the contribution rate affecting rice
quality tended to be in the order of N > K > P, with the interactive
effect of N and K surpassing that of N and P (Xie et al., 2014). In the
present study, milling quality of YXY 2115 decreased with
increasing N levels. As more K was gradually applied at the same
N level, both MR and HR first increased and then decreased. The
above results indicated that N and K mutually promoted each other,
and their combined application was beneficial for improving the
milling quality of rice. The appearance quality of YXY 2115
increased with increasing N levels. However, as more K was
gradually applied at the same N level, obvious increases in CR

and CD were found. This result was not consistent with the

previous studies (Wang, 2015). The possible reason for this
difference could be the relatively high content of available K in
the experimental field soil, causing a decrease in the appearance
quality of rice when additional K was applied. In general, higher
fertilizer application tends to result in increased rice yield, but may
reduce rice eating quality. Parts of rice quality indexes can be
significantly enhanced within a certain level of K application (Ye,
2021). Co-application of N and K can increase protein content of
rice, thereby improve rice nutritional quality. However, the lack of
K will lead to a decline in both the eating quality and nutritional
value of rice (Zhang, 2017). In our study, the cooking and eating
quality of YXY 2115 decreased with increasing N levels. As more K



was gradually applied at the same N level, the taste value,
appearance and mouthfeel all first increased and then decreased,
in agreement with the previous studies (Zhang and Qian, 2017). It is
widely recognized that rice cultivars with high eating quality
normally show higher peak viscosity and breakdown viscosity,
coupled with lower setback viscosity, as determined by the RVA.
Variance analysis showed that co-application of N and K had
significant interactive effects on PV, BV and SV. However, no
significant differences or prominent impacts were found in the
response of RVA profile characters to co-application of N and K
over a two-year field experiment, indicating that the combined
application of N and K had limited effects on rice starch viscosity
(Zhang, 2017). Taken together, in order to improve the appearance,
milling, and cooking and eating quality of rice, a reasonable
nitrogen-potassium ratio becomes particularly important. The
optimal milling, cooking and eating quality were obtained under
N1K2, while the best appearance quality was obtained under N3K0.

## 5 Conclusion


Reasonable combined application of N and K can mitigate
fertilizer waste, reduce environmental pollution, lower production
costs and increase economic benefits by improving fertilizer use
efficiency, rice yield and quality, thereby achieving the sustainable
development of agriculture. The present study investigated the
effects of co-application of N and K on rice yield, quality and
nutrients absorption and utilization through a two-year field
experiment. The results revealed the feasibility of enhancing rice
production efficiency and yield through co-application of N and K,
which might provide an important reference for the large-scale
promotion and application of Yixiangyou 2115. The highest rice
yield was obtained under N2K2, while the optimal rice quality was
obtained under N1K2. Thus, we recommended appropriate N
application levels ranging from 206 kg ha [-1] to 210 kg ha [-1],
combined with K application levels ranging from 115 kg ha [-1] to
137 kg ha [-1] as a preferable approach to achieve high yield for super
hybrid indica rice cultivar Yixiangyou 2115 in southwest China. A
combination of 135 kg ha [-1] N and 135 kg ha [-1] K application rates
was recommended for achieving better quality in rice production.
