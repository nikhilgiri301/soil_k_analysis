## A guide to the total and available phosphate, potash, magnesium and sulphur contents.

for nitrogen contents and full details see the data source:

Typical phosphate, potash, magnesium and sulphur contents in some animal and other organic materials. These can

be used as default contents in the absence of actual measured or declared values.





















(1) Nutrients available to the next crop (kg/tonne of product, not %).

(2) See back page for sulphur availability.

(3) Potash values will be lower if FYM is stored in the open for long periods.

(4) Adjust nutrient contents if % DM is higher or lower.



**DM** = Dry matter. **ND** = No data.
To convert **kg/t** to **units/ton**, multiply by 2.
To convert **kg/m** **[3]** to **units/1000 gallons**, multiply by 9.


#### **Sulphur availability from organic materials**

Organic materials contain valuable amounts of crop-available sulphur and recent research
has quantified sulphur supply from livestock manures and biosolids applications. Sulphur
from autumn applications may be lost via overwinter leaching. The quantity leached will

depend on soil type and overwinter rainfall and is likely to be higher on light textured soils

in high rainfall areas.








#### **The importance of laboratory analysis and sampling**

The nutrient content of organic manures on farms vary widely and so it is better to have
a laboratory analysis carried out to get the correct values specifically for the farm and
the year in question. However, it is important that the sample taken for analysis is truly

representative. This means that sampling should be undertaken according to the protocol

given in the AHDB Nutrient Management Guide (RB209), Section 2 Organic Manures.


In the absence of a recent analysis, and where thorough sampling can not be done, these

typical values represent an alternative for nutrient planning purposes.
