Abstract: Nonexchangeable potassium (K) release kinetics of six major benchmark
soil series of India as affected by mineralogy of clay and silt fractions, soil depth
and extraction media was investigated. The cumulative release of nonexchangeable
K was greater in smectitic soils (353 mg K kg [2][1] at 0- to 15-cm depth and
296 mg K kg [2][1] at 15- to 30-cm depth, averaged for 2 soils and 3 extractants) than in
illitic (151 mg K kg [2][1] at 0- to 15-cm depth and 112 mg K kg [2][1] at 15- to 30-cm
depth) and kaolinitic (194 mg K kg [2][1] at 0- to 15-cm depth and 167 mg K kg [2][1] at 15to 30-cm depth) soils. Surface soils exhibited larger cumulative K release in
smectitic and illitic soils, whereas subsurface soils had larger K release in kaolinitic

soils. Among the extractants, 0.01 M citric acid extracted a larger amount of nonexchangeable K followed by 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M HCl. The efficiency of citric
acid extractant was greater in illitic soils than in smectitic and kaolinitic soils.
Release kinetics of nonexchangeable K conformed fairly well to parabolic and firstorder kinetic models. The curve pattern of parabolic diffusion model suggested
diffusion controlled kinetics in all the soils, with a characteristic initial fast rate up
to 7 h followed by a slower rate. Greater nonexchangeable K release rates in
smectitic soils, calculated from the first-order equation (b ¼ 91.13 � 10 [2][4] h [2][1] ),
suggested that the layer edge and wedge zones and swelling nature of clay facilitated
the easier exchange. In contrast to smectitic soils, higher release rate constants obtained
from parabolic diffusion equation (b ¼ 39.23 � 10 [2][3] h [2][1] ) in illitic soils revealed that
the low amount of exchangeable K on clay surface and larger amount of interlayer K
allowed greater diffusion gradients, thus justifying the better fit of first-order kinetic
equation in smectitic soils and parabolic diffusion equation in illitic soils.

INTRODUCTION


It has been well established that a significant proportion of plant needs of
potassium (K) are met from nonexchangeable fraction of soil K (Mengel
1985; Srinivasarao et al. 1999, 2000). Under intensive cropping, in the
absence of K fertilization, initially exchangeable K in soil contributes to
plant K nutrition, but with further cropping, exchangeable K attains a
certain minimal level; afterward, plant K removal from soil and contribution
of nonexchangeable K to K uptake are almost synonymous and accounts for
up to 90–95% of the total plant K uptake (Srinivasarao and Khera 1994).
Because of the larger contribution of nonexchangeable K to plant K needs,
lack of crop responses to applied K have been reported even in soils with
low exchangeable K (Mengel and Uhlenbecker 1993). The major sources of
nonexchangeable K in soils are K-rich 2 : 1 clay minerals such as micas and
vermiculite (Sparks et al. 1987; Moritsuka et al. 2004). However, the
release of K from the interlayer of these minerals may be very slow,
depending on the weathering stage of these minerals; therefore, whether the
K release rates of soils under cropping are in tune with plant K needs
becomes the most important aspect as far as K nutrition of crop plants is
concerned.

Nonexchangeable K in soil is extracted by using several extractants such
as dilute salt solutions (Lopez-Pineiro and Garcia-Navarro 1997), cation
exchange resins (Martin and Sparks 1983), organic acids (Song and Huang
1988), sodium tetraphenyl boran (Cox and Joern 1997), nitric acid (GilSotres and Rubio 1992). Electroultrafiltration (EUF) is also used (Rubio and
Gil-Sotres 1996). Several kinetic equations have been used to study the
release of nonexchangeable K. These include first-order (Srinivasarao et al.
1998), parabolic diffusion (Sharma and Swami 2000), zero-order


Release Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 475


(Srinivasarao et al. 1998) and Elovich equation (Martin and Sparks 1983).
However, different models have been found to fare better in explaining K
release from soil particles or whole soils under particular condition because
of the differences in release mechanisms (Carey and Metherell 2003). The performance of a particular model may be varying in relation to soil K status
(Elkhatib and Hern 1988), K-depleted/undepleted soils (Srinivasarao et al.
1998), extraction media (Sharma and Swami 2000), and stage of extraction
(early/later) (Burns and Barber 1961). Better performance of parabolic
diffusion equation for light textured Chomu and Pali series compared with
heavy textured Chambal series of India was reported by Sharma and Swami
(2000) in explaining K release in CaCl 2 solution. Better performance of
first-order equation for smectitic black soils was also reported earlier by
Dhillon et al. (1989) in CaCl 2 medium over illitic alluvial and kaolinitic red
soils. Nonexchangeable K release confirmed to first-order kinetics better in
K-rich clay soils in 0.01 M CaCl 2 medium compared with light textured
soils (Sharma and Swami 2000).
Although a major portion of plant nutrients is absorbed by crop plants
from the surface soil, subsoil contribution to nutrition is often substantial
(Beringer 1985). A great majority of studies on K in soils have been solely
concerned with samples collected from the surface soils (0–15 cm).
Different forms of K in subsoil (15–30 cm) were evaluated in relation to
those in surface soil (0–15 cm) in 22 benchmark soil series of India, which
indicated that subsoil K contribution was up to 96% of the surface soils
(Srinivasarao et al. 2001). The present study examines the nonexchangeable
K release from different benchmark soils of India representing a wide area
varying in their mineralogy and K status. Nonexchangeable K release from
subsoils is important because many crops can obtain substantial amounts of
K from lower layers especially in deep rooted crops. Therefore, the objectives
of present study are 1) to evaluate the nonexchangeable K release from
important benchmark soils varying in mineralogy, K status, and also in
relation to soil depth and extraction media; 2) to evaluate different mathematical models for describing nonexchangeable K release and to find
whether their performance varies with mineralogical composition of soils,
soil K status, and extraction media; and 3) to examine the relationship of K
release rates obtained in the kinetic studies with conventional soil test

measures of K.


MATERIALS AND METHODS


Soil Analysis


Physicochemical and mineralogical properties of six benchmark surface
(0–15 cm) and sub-surface (15–30 cm) soils that occur widely in intensively
cultivated regions in six states of India sampled by Potash Research Institute

of India, Gurgaon, were used in the present study. Details on soil series, location,
taxonomic classification, selected soil properties, and soil test K are given in
Table 1. Soil pH was measured in a 1 : 2.5 (w/v) soil to water mixture by
using a glass pH electrode (Elico pH analyzer model LI-612). Organic carbon
(organic C) was determined by the wet oxidation method of Walkley and
Black (1934), and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) was estimated by using the
method of Bundy and Bremner (1972). Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of
the soils was determined by the sodium acetate (NaC 2 H 3 O 2 ) method
(Richards 1954). Different extractable forms of K [e.g., water-soluble
(Jackson 1973), 1 N NH 4 OAc (Hanway and Heidel 1952), and sodium tetraphenyl boron (NaTPB) (Schulte and Corey, 1965)] were determined.


Mineralogical Analysis


The mineralogical composition of silt and clay fractions is given in Table 2.
For mineralogical analysis, the soils were dispersed in 1% sodium hexametaphosphate with vigorous shaking (Sidhu and Gikes 1977). The sand
fraction (0.05–2 mm) was separated by wet-sieving, and the silt fraction
(0.002–0.05 mm) was separated by sedimentation. The clay (,0.002 mm)
suspension was siphoned off after requisite settling time (Jackson 1973).
The silt and clay samples were flocculated with excess KCl and MgCl 2 . The
Mg-saturated silt and clay samples were X-rayed, glycolated, and X-rayed
again with a Philips diffractometer. Potassium-saturated silt and clay
samples were X-rayed after drying for 1 h and again after heating to 5008C
for 1 h. Based on the peak area of different reflections, a semiquantitative
analysis of different minerals in the silt and clay fractions was undertaken
by following the procedure of Klages and Hopper (1982).
Kamliakheri and Noyyal soil series belong to Vertisol and Vertic
subgroups, are alkaline in pH, calcareous in nature, fine textured, and are
smectite dominant soils. Lukhi and Rarha series belong to Inceptisols with
illite as dominant clay mineral. Kodad and Vijayapura series belong to
Alfisols and are kaolinite dominant. Soils of Vijayapura series had a considerable amount of amorphous materials, which are mainly hydrous oxides of iron
(Fe), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and hydrated silico-aluminas. In each
group, two series with wide variation in soil test nonexchangeable K were
included in this study to understand the differences in K chemistry of soils
with similar mineralogical composition.


Nonexchangeable Potassium Release Kinetics


Native exchangeable K was removed from surface and subsurface soils before
initiating the kinetic studies (Martin and Sparks 1983). For this, soil samples
were calcium (Ca) saturated by equilibrating 5 g soil with 0.25 M CaCl 2 three

times and washing free of Cl [2] with absolute alcohol, and then the samples were
washed with deionized water until a negative test for Cl [2] was obtained with
AgNO 3, and soils were oven dried at 608C. One gram each of Ca-saturated
soils, in duplicate, suspended in 20mL of 0.01 M CaCl 2, 0.01 M citric acid,
and 0.01 M HCl media were equilibrated at 258C for 1, 7, 19, 43, 67, 95,
115, 139, 163, 187, 211, 235, 259, 283, 307, 331, 355, 379, 403, and 427 h
by shaking for 1 h before the suspensions were centrifuged for 10min at
10,000 � g. The supernatant liquid was measured for K by flame photometer
(Elico Model CL-360).
Nonexchangeable K released with time was fitted by using the different
equations (Martin and Sparks 1983).

Parabolic diffusion: K t =K 0 ¼ a þ bt [1][=][2]

Zero-order reaction: ðK 0 � K t Þ ¼ a � bt
Elovich equation: K t ¼ a þ b lnt


where K t is the cumulative K released (mg/kg) at time t (hours), K 0 is the
maximum cumulative K released (mg/kg), and a and b are constants. Four
models were tested by the least-square regression analysis to determine
which equation described better the nonexchangeable K release from the
soils. Standard error of the estimate (SE) was calculated by
SE ¼ [(q 2 q [�] ) [2] /n 2 2)] [1][/][2], where q and q [�] represent the measured and calculated amounts of nonexchangeable K in soil at time t, respectively, and n is the
number of data points evaluated. The rate constants of K release from soils in
different media of extraction were calculated on the basis of these models.


RESULTS AND DISCUSSION


Nonexchangeable Potassium Release


The pattern of successive extraction of nonexchangeable K from soils
belonging to three mineralogically different soil series (i.e., smectitic
Noyyal, illitic Rarha, and kaolinitic Vijayapura in different media of extraction] is presented in Figure 1. The amounts of K released during 427 h of
extraction period was generally higher in smectite dominant soils followed
by illite and kaolinite dominant soils (Table 3). However, there were deviations in the nonexchangeable K release in the citric acid medium where
illitic Lukhi series (0–15 cm) and kaolinitic Kodad series (15–30 cm)
showed larger K release than smectitic Kamliakheri series. The amount of
K extracted was greater in the first 3–4 extractions, decreased in later extractions, and then remained nearly constant after 10–11 extractions (Carey and
Metherell 2003; Pannu et al. 2003). Within each group, there was a wide
variation in the cumulative K release between soils (Table 2). Kamliakheri

and Noyyal series were dominantly smectitic, but there was three- to four-fold
higher release in Noyyal series than in Kamliakheri series. The difference
between nonexchangeable K release between two series could be due to
variation in clay mineral composition in silt and clay fractions of soil
(Table 2). In Kamliakheri soil series, smectite and vermiculite were the

dominant minerals in clay fraction and in silt fraction, feldspars þ quartz was
the dominant mineral. In Noyyal soil series, smectite and illite were the
dominant mineral followed by feldspars þ quartz, and kaolinite in clay
fraction, and feldspars þ quartz and illite in silt fraction. Presence of considerable amounts of K-rich minerals, such as illite in silt and clay fractions of soils
with fine texture, could result in larger K release as in Noyyal series.
Lukhi and Rarha series belonging to Inceptisols showed considerable
differences in nonexchangeable K release. Rarha series showed higher K
release than Lukhi series, irrespective of soil depth and extraction medium.
In both cases, illite was the dominant mineral followed by chlorite, vermiculite, feldspars þ quartz, and kaolinite in clay fraction. Illite was dominant in
silt fraction of both Rarha and Lukhi series. Similarly, in kaolinitic soils, considerable quantities of illite in silt and clay fractions of Kodad series resulted
in larger K release than Vijayapura series. Thus, fine texture, together with
illite/mica dominance in silt and clay factions of soils, are major factors for
larger nonexchangeable K release in soils. Several authors reported earlier
that soils of fine texture showed larger K release than coarse textured soils
(Martin and Sparks 1983). On the basis of relationships established between
K replenishment rates of soils and amount and nature of clay minerals in
illitic alluvial soils (Srinivasarao and Khera 1994) and smectitic Vertisols
(Srinivasarao et al. 1998) it was stated that the release of K from nonexchangeable source depends mainly on the composition of clay minerals in soils.
Although soils having high clay are generally associated with high reserves
of soil K, it is not essentially true for all the soils.
Surface soils (0–15 cm) showed larger cumulative K release in smectitic
and illitic soils than subsurface (15–30 cm) soils, irrespective of the medium
of extraction. In kaolinitic soils, surface soils showed either the same or lower

K release than subsurface soils. This result could be due to downward

movement of finer particles with leaching during rainy seasons. Therefore,
subsoil K plays an important role in Alfisols soils, which are generally low
in K because of lower levels of K-bearing minerals. Evaluating the subsoil
K availability of 22 benchmark soil series of India, Srinivasarao et al.
(2001) reported that light textured red and lateritic and acidic alluvial soils
had larger K availability in subsurface soils than surface soils.
Cumulative K release varied significantly among the media of extraction.
In all the soils, larger amount of K was extracted in 0.01 M citric acid followed
by 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M HCl. The differences in K release among the
extraction media could be attributed to differences in their nature of reaction

in soil. Larger amount of K released in citric acid is due to the dissociated
H [þ] ions and complexing organic ligands in the organic acid medium. The
low molecular weight organic acids with OH and COOH groups in the orthoposition tend to form metal-organic complexes in solution with some metal
ions from mineral structures (Kononova et al. 1964), thus accelerating the
mineral decomposition. Although the HCl medium also possesses proton
source, the mechanism is restricted only to exchange of H [þ] ions with K [þ]

ions of minerals. Once exchange positions are filled with H [þ], further exchange
from highly selective sites of minerals is difficult with dilute acid solutions. In
0.01 M CaCl 2, the K [þ] ions on the surface of mineral structure are exchanged by
Ca [2][þ] in the CaCl 2 solution. Because of larger size of Ca [2][þ] ions and hydration
energy (Rich 1968), it does not exchange easily with K further in the interlayer.
The efficiency of citric acid medium was greater than CaCl 2 solution in
illitic soils than in smectitic and kaolinitic soils. The increase in extracted K
was 20 (68 mg/kg) to 43% (114 mg/kg) in smectitic soils, 85 (104 mg/kg)
to 81% (74 mg/kg) in illitic soils, and 19 (16 mg/kg) to 50% (41 mg/kg) in
kaolinitic soils, respectively.


Mathematical Models


Different mathematical models (e.g., first-order, parabolic diffusion equation,
zero-order, and Elovich) were tested for their suitability to describe the release
of nonexchangeable K from six mineralogically different benchmark soils
(i.e., Kamliakheri, Noyyal, Lukhi, Rarha, Kodad, and Vijayapura (Table 4).
Results showed that parabolic diffusion equation described the reaction
rates fairy well, as evidenced by the highest coefficient of determination
values for 0.01 M CaCl 2 (r [2] ¼ 0.92–0.99; mean ¼ 0.98), 0.01 M citric acid
(r [2] ¼ 0.94–0.99; mean ¼ 0.98), and 0.01 M HCl (r [2] ¼ 0.73–0.98;
mean ¼ 0.93), respectively. The lowest standard error values ranged from
0.02 to 0.05 (mean ¼ 0.03) for CaCl 2, from 0.03 to 0.05 (mean ¼ 0.03) for
citric acid, and from 0.03 to 0.08 (mean ¼ 0.05) for HCl media. This result
shows that rate of K release from nonexchangeable fraction is a function of
the reciprocal of [p] t and is diffusion controlled exchange reaction from the
mineral matrix or weathered periphery. The fit of K t /K 0 and the [p] t for the
three benchmark surface and subsurface soils with varied mineralogy and K
status is shown in Figure 2. Successful description of K release by parabolic
diffusion equation of K was reported by Martin and Sparks (1983) for
Kalmia and Kennansville soils of the United States and by Dhillon et al.
(1989) and Srinivasarao et al. (2000) for some Indian soils. However, there
were some differences in r [2] and SE values of parabolic diffusion equation
among soil series and extraction media. Relatively higher r [2] and lower SE
values were observed for illitic and kaolinitic soils than for smectitic soils.
Among the media, citric acid and CaCl 2 showed higher r [2] and lower SE
values. Followed by parabolic diffusion equation, first-order kinetic
equation also explained well the nonexchangeable K release from soils as
indicated by higher mean r [2] values of 0.94 in all three extractants and lower
SE ranging from 0.26 to 0.29 (Table 4). The performance of first-order
equation holds good irrespective of extraction medium, but it explained
better for smectitic soils (r [2] ¼ 0.95–0.96) than for kaolinitic soils
(r [2] ¼ 0.91–0.92). Almost linear relationships between ln (K 0 2 K t ) vs. time
in different extraction media are presented in Figure 3. Successful description

media, and mathematical models tested. There were considerable differences

in rate constants between surface and subsurface soils.

First-order release rate constants showed larger values for smectitic soils
followed by illitic and kaolinitic soils. For all soils, 0.01 M citric acid medium
showed greater release rate constants followed by 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M
HCl. The rate constants for smectitic soils varied from 99.99 to
101.55 � 10 [2][4] /h, for illitic soils from 81.02 to 91.38 � 10 [–4] /h, and for
kaolinitic soils from 63.81 to 81.26 � 10 [2][4] /h. The mean rate constants for
all the soils were 91.40 � 10 [2][4] /h in citric acid, 84.45 � 10 [2][4] /h in CaCl 2
and 81.47 � 10 [2][4] /h in HCl media. The rate constants observed in the
present study were comparable with those reported by Munn et al. (1976)
for K release from soil separates (22.8–56.2 � 10 [2][4] /h) and Srinivasarao
et al. (1998) for some smectitic soils of central India (126–153 � 10 [2][4] /h)
in 0.01 M CaCl 2 . In all the soils 20–50% of K release occurred within 7 h
of extraction period. Thereafter, the release was a slow and continuing
process. The rapid initial release may be from the easily accessible sites on
the external planar surfaces and peripheral edge sites, whereas the later
slow release may be from the interlayer sites of the clay complex (Bolt
et al. 1963). In all the soil groups, the finer the soil texture, the higher were
the rate constants. Smectitic soils with higher clay content and larger edge
and wedge sites showed greater release rate constants. Higher K release
rates in citric acid medium compared with CaCl 2 and HCl indicates greater
mobilization of K by citric acid, especially during the later stages of K
release by complexing organic ligands (Song and Huang 1988). This trend
was very much pronounced in illitic soil series (Table 3). This finding
was in accordance with Sposito’s hypothesis that the surface bearing
charged siloxane ditrigonal cavities in soils reacts with dissolved organic
matter and forms complexes through exchangeable cations (Sposito 1984).
Lower K release rate constants in CaCl 2 could be due to larger size of
hydrated Ca [2][þ] (4.3 A [˚ ] ) than hydrated K [þ] (3.3 A [˚ ] ); therefore, wedge zones
would selectively screen out the Ca [2][þ] ion because of its larger size (Martin
and Sparks 1983).
Greater K release rate constants in smectitic soils could be due to fine
texture and larger wedge zones, and its swelling clay where the exchange is
relatively easier, whereas K [þ] in illitic soils is held tightly and exchange is
slower. This may be the reason for better performance of first-order equation
for smectitic soils irrespective of medium. Kaolinitic soils with light texture
and lower amounts of K mica/illitic and vermiculite showed lower K
release rates. Although illite-dominant alluvial soils possess large amount of
nonexchangeable K reserves (NaTPB-K) as shown in Table 1, its release is
slower. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient values between soil test nonexchangeable K extracted in NaTPB and cumulative K release in different
extraction media were lower (r [2] ¼ 0.58–0.72). Once the illitic soils were
excluded, including smectitic and kaolinitic soils, r [2] values improved substantially (r [2] ¼ 0.94–0.95). Because of this reason, illite-rich alluvial soils, even


Release Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 489


though with high nonexchangeable K status, may suffer from K deficiency
under intensive cropping because the rate of K release from nonexchangeable to exchangeable/solution phase is not sufficient to meet the plant K
uptake.
Rate constants of parabolic diffusion equation in different media ranged
from 28.03 to 36.08 � 10 [2][3] /h for smectitic soils, 28.84 to 41.25 � 10 [2][3] /h
for illitic soils, and 27.30 to 40.78 � 10 [2][3] /h for kaolinitic soils. Unlike
those of first-order equation, smectitic soils showed lower release rate
constants than illitic and kaolinitic soils in all the three media of extraction.

Release rate constants of parabolic diffusion equation depend on diffusion
gradient between interlayer (source) and exchange surfaces (sink) in the
clay structure because it assumes that the rate-limiting step is the diffusion
of K ions from the interior of the particle to surface. Lower exchangeable K
on clay surface and larger interlayer K in illite clay structure resulted in
larger diffusion gradients in illitic soils, hence the higher release rate
constants than smectitic and kaolinitic soils. This finding may be the most
probable reason for better performance of parabolic diffusion equation in
illitic soils. The lowest magnitude of parabolic rate constants in case of
smectitic black soils could be attributed to higher clay content.
Similarly intercept (a) values of the first-order and parabolic models were
higher for smectitic soils followed by illitic and kaolinitic soils (Table 5). The
positive and highly significant correlation (r [2] ¼ 0.94) between nonexchangeable K extracted in NaTPB and intercept values of the first-order equation as
the extrapolated intercept is assumed to be proportional to the initial concentration in soil solution at time ¼ 0. Therefore, the higher the intercept values,
the greater was the initial soil test K (Elkhatib and Hern 1988).


CONCLUSIONS


For assessing K fertilizer needs, the information on nonexchangeable K
release from smectitic, illitic soils, and kaolinitic soils should be taken into
consideration. The study further indicated that the 0.01 M citric acid
extracted more K than did 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M HCl in these soils.
Furthermore, citric acid medium was found to be superior in extracting nonexchangeable K from illitic soils compared with smectitic and kaolinitic
soils. The better fit of the first-order model to the data for smectitic soils
than for illitic soils and also the relatively better fit of the parabolic model
to the data for illitic soils than for smectitic soils would suggest that the
rate-limiting step is either film diffusion or exchange reaction for smectites
(due to their swelling nature) and intraparticular diffusion for illites (the interlayer space being more closed). Thus, the information generated from
the different kinetic models can help to explain the release mechanisms in
mineralogically dissimilar soils.
