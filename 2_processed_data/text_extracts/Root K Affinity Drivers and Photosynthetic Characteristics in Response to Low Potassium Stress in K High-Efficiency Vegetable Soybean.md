Significant variations of potassium absorption and utilization exist in vegetable soybean.

Pot and hydroponic experiments were carried out to examine the characteristics of

root potassium (K) affinity-associated drivers and photosynthesis in vegetable soybean
(edamame) [ _Glycine max_ (L.) Merr.] with different K efficiency. Two K high-efficiency
vegetable soybean genotypes (Line 19 and Line 20) and two K low-efficiency genotypes
(Line 7 and Line 36) were investigated in low K and normal K conditions. The root
of K high-efficiency genotypes had a higher K [+] affinity associated with a higher
maximum K [+] uptake rate ( _I_ max), but lower Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption ( _K_ m)
and lower compensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min). Seedlings of K highefficiency genotypes also had higher root vigor [triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)
reduction method] and greater absorbing activity (methylene blue method), especially
in the low K condition. Furthermore, the root bleeding-sap rate of K high-efficiency
genotypes in low K stress was 9.9–24.3% greater than that of normal K conditions,

which was accompanied by a relatively higher K concentration of root bleeding-sap
in contributing to K [+] upward flux. The root of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean
genotypes exhibited K [+] high-affinity and driving advantages. Photosynthetic parameters
of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes were less affected by low K stress.
Low K stress decreased the net photosynthetic rate of K high-efficiency genotypes by
6.1–6.9%, while that of K low-efficiency genotypes decreased by 10.9–15.7%. The
higher chlorophyll (Chl) a/b ratio with enhanced relative content of Chl a in response
to low K stress might be an adapted mechanism for K high-efficiency genotypes
to maintain photosynthetic capacity. Stronger root K affinity drivers associated with

photosynthetic adaptability to low K stress are the key factors in determining the K
high-efficiency of vegetable soybeans.

Liu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean



INTRODUCTION


Potassium application benefits vegetable soybean yield and
quality (Liu et al., 2017), while the direct absorption and
utilization of available potassium by plants in cultivated soil
are always essential (Singh and Reddy, 2017; Chen et al., 2020;
Dev et al., 2021). Selecting and breeding potassium (K) efficient
varieties of vegetable soybean is an important biological means
in making full use of K resources (Rengel and Damon, 2008).
Previous studies have shown that there are great differences in K
efficiency among different genotypes. For instance, intraspecific
variations in K efficiency have been reported in many crops
including rice (Yang et al., 2003), wheat (Zhang et al., 1999;
Damon and Rengel, 2007), sweet potato (Wang et al., 2015),
tomato (Chen and Gabelman, 1995), and soybean (Sale and
Campell, 1987; Wang C. et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019b).
Differences in the K efficiency of crops can be understood
from two main aspects, such as (1) the difference in K uptake
efficiency and (2) the difference in K utilization efficiency (Rengel
and Damon, 2008). The utilization efficiency of K refers to the
ability of the crop to convert unit K into dry matter yield (Wang
et al., 2018). K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes are
good at redistributing K and dry matters with higher harvest
index (HI) and higher K harvest index (KHI) (Liu et al.,
2019b). K uptake efficiency emphasizes the capacity of root K
absorption (Tsialtas et al., 2017). The higher specific K uptake rate
(total K content/total root length) in K high-efficiency vegetable
soybean genotypes ensures the supply of K to the whole plant.
Besides, K high-efficiency genotypes also have a strong ability
to regulate their root architecture to adapt to low K conditions
(Liu et al., 2019a).
Except for root morphology, K uptake kinetic parameters,
root bleeding-sap, and root vigor are also demonstrated as
effective parameters in evaluating K uptake efficiency (Teo
et al., 1992; Hao et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,
2017). Sufficient K can increase plant hydraulic conductance and
transpiration (Pettigrew, 2008). The vigorous root can increase
nutrient and water uptake, promoting the whole plant growth.
For instance, the root bleeding-sap and the upward fluxes of
K are higher in the cotton cultivars with high K efficiency
(Yang, 2011). As substrates for photosynthesis, water and mineral
elements absorbed by plant roots are transported upward by
transpiration (Liu et al., 2016). Improved root characteristics
may contribute to plant-water status, enhanced photosynthesis,
biomass, and yield of soybean cultivars (Cui et al., 2016). In
cotton, K efficient genotype 103 has more suitable K absorption
kinetic parameters and more efficient photosynthate transport
(Hao et al., 2015, 2016). Thus, the uptake power of the root
system determines the supply of nutrients in the above-ground
part of the plant.
Less photosynthetic assimilates and reduced assimilate
transport out of the leaves to the developing fruit greatly
contribute to the negative consequences that deficiencies of
K have on yield and quality production (Pettigrew, 2008).
Genotypic variations in photosynthetic decline caused by K
deficiency have been reported. For instance, compared with the
K-inefficient cotton cultivar, the K-efficient cultivar has a higher



net photosynthetic rate (Pn) associated with higher biomass
products (Wang N. et al., 2012).
Hence, understanding how plants take up and use K
is of scientific and practical importance. Research into this
mechanism has become increasingly urgent as a result of major
ecological and agricultural issues. In our previous studies, K
high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes were demonstrated
with a strong K uptake and redistribution ability (Liu et al.,
2019a,b). However, the root uptake dynamics and photosynthetic
characteristics of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean are still
not clear. Therefore, this study compared the differences of
root activity, root bleeding-sap, the upward fluxes of K, K
kinetics parameters, photosynthetic parameters, and chlorophyll
content between K high-efficiency and K low-efficiency vegetable
soybean genotypes. The data obtained revealed the mechanisms
underlying K absorption and utilization of high-efficiency in
vegetable soybean.


MATERIALS AND METHODS


Plant Material

Based on previous K efficiency selection (Liu et al., 2019a), two
K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes (Line 19 and Line
20) and two K low-efficiency genotypes (Line 7 and Line 36) were
used in this study. Compared with K low-efficiency genotypes, the
K high-efficiency genotypes have higher K agronomic efficiency
(KAE), recovery, internal utilization-efficiency rate (KIUE), and
specific K uptake rate (Liu et al., 2019a,b). Greater reductions
in K concentration of vegetative organs were found in K highefficiency genotypes than K low-efficiency genotypes in low K
conditions (Liu et al., 2019b). All genotypes were released by
the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Harbin, China.


Experimental Design
A pot experiment was conducted at the agronomy farm of
Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Harbin, China (45 [◦] 732N, 126 [◦] 612E;
altitude 128 m a.s.l.) in 2017. The soil used was a typical Mollisol
(Black soil) with the following properties: soil pH 6.6, organic
matter 28.9 g kg [−][1], total N 2.3 g kg [−][1], total P 1.3 g kg [−][1], total K
18.9 g kg [−][1], available N 159 mg kg [−][1], available P 57.0 mg kg [−][1],
and available K 85 mg kg [−][1] (insufficient for vegetable soybean
yield and quality; Liu et al., 2017). The experiment was conducted
in a completely random design with three replicates and five pots
per replicate. About 3 seeds per pot were sown in May 2017 with
regular manual pest and weed control. The pot size was 32 cm in
diameter by 27 cm tall. A uniform fertilizer application at seeding
included 70 kg ha [−][1] diammonium phosphate and 98 kg ha [−][1]

urea. Treatments consisted of two K-fertilizer rates at seeding,
K 2 SO 4 0 kg ha [−][1] (K0) and K 2 SO 4 120 kg ha [−][1] (K120). Plants
were randomly harvested at fourth-node (V4), full bloom (R2),
beginning seed (R5), and full seed (R6) stages (Fehr et al., 1971)
for root bleeding-sap and K upward fluxes measurement.
A hydroponic experiment was used for K [+] absorption kinetic
parameters, root vigor, and root absorbing activity test. Seeds

of the four selected genotypes were sterilized and germinated
on moistened filter paper in a plant growth chamber at 60%
humidity and 28 [◦] C, under a 16 h light, 8 h dark cycle for 3–
4 days. After that, the seedlings were transferred into light-proof
glass boxes (volume 15 cm [3] × 20 cm [3] × 20 cm [3] ) with halfstrength modified Hoagland nutrient solution, as described by
Wang C. et al. (2012). There were six replications in each box.
The cotyledons of all samples were excised to eliminate any
additional supply of nutrients. When the plants grew to the
first trifoliolate stage (V1), they were treated with half-strength
Hoagland nutrient solution with different concentrations of
K [+] (0.5 and 3 mmol L [−][1] ). The K source was K 2 SO 4 . The
initial pH value of the nutrient solution was 6, which was
adjusted by 0.1 mol L [−][1] NaOH or 0.1 mol L [−][1] HCl. After
transplanting, the samples were continuously cultured for 9 days.
The nutrient solution was changed every 3 days and kept
enough O 2 by regular ventilation with an air pump. The pH
value of the solution was adjusted to 6 when the nutrient
solution was changed.


Measurements

Collection of root bleeding-sap: root bleeding-sap collection was
based on the method used by Cui et al. (2016) with slight
improvements in the pot experiments. The root bleeding-sap
was conducted from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at V4, R2, R5,
and R6 stages. The plants were cut with branch scissors at
cotyledons position, and the cross-section was cleaned with
a small amount of absorbent cotton and then immediately
connected to the root bleeding-sap collection device and the
joint was sealed. The collected root bleeding-sap was temporarily
stored in a refrigerator at 4 [◦] C for measurement. The formula was
as follows: root bleeding-sap rate (g h [−][1] per plant) = bleedingsap weight/4 h.
Where K upward fluxes = root bleeding-sap rate × K
concentration, K concentration was determined by flame
spectrophotometer (INESA FP6400A, Shanghai, China) (Liu
et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2017).
K [+] absorption kinetic parameters: A measurement of a
depletion curve of a single plant. Five replicates per genotype
were conducted. After K deficiency and starvation for 48 h,
samples under the treatment of K3 at 9 days were immersed
in 0.2 mmol L [−][1] CaSO 4 solutions three times, dried, and put
into a 200 ml absorption solution. The composition of the
absorption solution was 0.05 mmol L [−][1] potassium chloride
(KCl) + 0.2 mmol L [−][1] CaSO 4 . The absorption solution
was placed in a dark conical flask, the culture temperature
was (25 ± 2) [◦] C, and the light intensity was 210–260 mol
m [−][2] s [−][1] . Parameter calculation including the maximum K [+]

uptake rate ( _I_ max), Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption
(Km), compensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min), and
statistical analysis refers to the modified method of Epstein
and Hagen (1952) and Claassen and Barber (1977). _C_ min
represents the concentration of K [+] in the solution when
the concentration remains constant. Ion consumption curve
equation: Y = a + bX + cX [2] (1), take the negative derivative
of the equation: Y’ = b + 2cX (2). Hence, if X goes to 0,
then Y’ = b = Km.



Root vigor, as determined by enzymatic reduction assay of
triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was conducted according
to the modified protocol of Duncan and Widholm (2004).
Root absorption activity was determined by methylene blue
adsorption (Zhang and Yan, 2003; Song and Wang, 2005). First,
the root volume is converted to 1 ml = 1 g. The root was put
into a solution with a known concentration of methylene blue for
1.5 min. Removed and placed the root into the second beaker,
repeated twice. Colorimetric determination of methylene blue
was conducted in the remaining solution in the three beakers
at 660 nm using the UV-visible spectrophotometer (PERSEE T6,
Beijing, China).

The ratio of actively absorbing area to total absorbing area _(_ % _)_

Photosynthetic properties of the youngest fully expanded
main-stem leaf (the third leaf from the apex) were determined
at 10:00–12:00 am at V4, R2, R4 (full pod), R5, and R6 stages
with a Li-6800 (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, United States) at 25 [◦] C,
60% relative humidity, 500 µmol mol [−][1] CO 2 concentration, and
1,200 µmol m [−][2] s [−][1] quantum flux.
Determination of chlorophyll (Chl) content (Wang et al.,
2021) was conducted using 0.2 g fresh leaves which were cut into
pieces and put into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Then, 20 ml of 80%
ethanol solution was added and then soaked in a dark place for
8 h. Absorbance was determined at 665 and 649 nm, respectively,
by the UV-visible spectrophotometer.


Chl a = 13 _._ 95A 665 − 6 _._ 88A 649

Chl b = 2 _._ 96A 649 − 7 _._ 32A 665
Total chlorophyll concentration = Chl a + Chl b _._


Statistical Analyses
Differences among treatments and genotypes were examined by
ANOVA using SPSS 17, and the means were separated by the
LSD test at the 5% level. Linear regression analysis between
root bleeding-sap rate per root length, K upward fluxes rate per
root length, K concentration of root bleeding-sap, and plant K
concentration were conducted after Pearson correlation analysis
using a two-tailed test in SPSS 17. The figures were created
using SigmaPlot 12.

RESULTS


Comparison of K **[+]** Absorption Kinetic
Parameters Between Two K Efficiency
Genotypes
**Table 1** shows the K [+] kinetics absorption parameters of the
four vegetable soybean genotypes in a hydroponic experiment.
The maximum K [+] uptake rate ( _I_ max) in K high-efficiency
genotypes was around 58.2–65.5 µmol g [−][1] min [−][1] FW, which
was significantly higher than that of K low-efficiency genotypes
around 42.4–54.1 µmol g [−][1] min [−][1] FW ( _P <_ 0.05). The
compensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min) in K highefficiency genotypes was 0.83–1.32 µmol L [−][1], which was lower
than that of K low-efficiency genotypes (3.16–3.22 µmol L [−][1] )
( _P_ <0.05). The Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption (Km) is
a parameter evaluating the affinity between root and K [+] . The
greater the value, the smaller the affinity. Higher affinity was
found in K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes with a
lower Km of 32.8–35.0 µmol L [−][1] than that of 48.6–49 µmol L [−][1]

in K low-efficiency genotypes ( _P <_ 0.05).


Root Bleeding-Sap and Upward Fluxes
of K **[+]** in the Pot Experiment
As shown in **Figure 1**, root bleeding-sap rate per plant showed
a trend of increasing first and then decreasing from the fourthnode (V4) to full seed (R6) stage with the maximum at full bloom
(R2) stage. The root bleeding-sap rate per plant of Line 20 was
the highest among the four genotypes with 1.8 ml h [−][1] root [−][1] in
K0 and 1.6 ml h [−][1] root [−][1] in K120, respectively. Compared with
K120 treatment, K0 treatment increased the average of the root
bleeding-sap rate per plant over the four stages by 9.9–24.3% in
K high-efficiency genotypes, but by –2.2–5.1% in K low-efficiency
genotypes. On the other hand, the root bleeding-sap rate per root
length in four genotypes was found higher at the V4–R2 stage,
dropped down at the R5–R6 stage. Interestingly, K high-efficiency
genotypes had a higher root bleeding-sap rate per root length
compared with K low-efficiency genotypes at the beginning seed
stage ( _P <_ 0.05). At this time, root bleeding-sap rate per root
length ranged 0.09–0.13 ml h [−][1] cm [−][1] in K0 and 0.10–0.15 ml
h [−][1] cm [−][1] in K120 treatment, while in K low-efficiency genotypes
kept around 0.05 ml h [−][1] cm [−][1] in K0 and 0.05–0.07 ml h [−][1] cm [−][1]

in K120 treatment.
Higher K upward fluxes were found in K120 treatment over
the four genotypes, which was accompanied consistently by a
higher concentration of K in the root bleeding-sap ( **Figure 2** ).

The K flux rate per root length was highest at the fourth-node
stage, with plant growth K flux rate per root length decreased.
At the beginning seed stage, K high-efficiency genotypes had
a higher K flux rate per root length and K concentration of
root bleeding sap compared with K low-efficiency genotypes
( _P <_ 0.05). The K flux rate per root length of K high-efficiency
genotypes was 19.4–32.4 µg h [−][1] cm [−][1] in K0 and 24.1–37.2 µg
h [−][1] cm [−][1] in K120 treatment, that of 7.6–8.7 µg h [−][1] cm [−][1] in K0
and 9–15.2 µg h [−][1] cm [−][1] in K120 treatment in K low-efficiency
genotypes. Meanwhile, K concentration of root bleeding-sap in
K high-efficiency genotypes reached 51.1–63.2 µg ml [−][1] in K0
and 60.2–64 µg ml [−][1] in K120 treatment at the beginning seed
stage, which was significantly higher than that of K low-efficiency
genotypes with 41.1–48 µg ml [−][1] in K0 and 46.1–52.4 µg ml [−][1] in
K120 treatment ( _P <_ 0.05).
Correlation analysis revealed that K upward fluxes rate
per root length and K concentration of root bleeding-sap
were positively correlated with K concentration per plant
( _P <_ 0.05) ( **Table 2** ).


Root Vigor and Absorbing Activity
The root vigor was tested in a hydroponic experiment using the
measurement of respiratory activity with triphenyl tetrazolium
chloride (TTC) ( **Figure 3** ). At the seedling stage (9 days after
treatment), the root vigor of K high-efficiency genotypes was
induced by low K stress. Low K stress (K0.5) increased the root
vigor of K high-efficiency genotypes by 46–85% compared with
normal K treatment (K3) ( _P <_ 0.05). Although no consistent
trend was observed in K low-efficiency genotypes, low K stress
decreased root vigor by 21% in Line 36 ( _P <_ 0.05). The highest
root vigor of 516 µg g [−][1] FW h [−][1] was found in Line 20 under
low K conditions.
The root absorbing activity parameters are shown in **Table 3** .
Higher total absorbing area and actively absorbing area were
found in K high-efficiency genotypes. Meanwhile, in K highefficiency genotypes, low K stress increased the actively absorbing
area by 21.4–30.6% and the total absorbing area by 9.6–19%
( _P <_ 0.05). In contrast, an opposite trend was found in
K low-efficiency genotypes. Under low K stress, the actively
absorbing area decreased by 6.1–10.3% and the total absorbing
area decreased by 6.6–15.7% ( _P >_ 0.05). Furthermore, K highefficiency genotypes also had a higher ratio of total absorbing
area to root volume, especially in Line 19 with 62.3 m [2] cm [−][3]

(K0.5) and 60.2 m [2] cm [−][3] (K3). Low K stress increased the ratio
of actively absorbing area to total absorbing area by 9.3–9.4%
in K high-efficiency genotype ( _P <_ 0.05), but by 0.6–5% in K
low-efficiency genotypes ( _P >_ 0.05).


Comparison of Photosynthetic
Parameters Between Two K Efficiency
Genotypes
A pot experiment was conducted to determine photosynthetic
parameters of two K efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes
affected by K deficiency (K0) are shown in **Figure 4** . K deficiency
decreased the photosynthetic rate (Pn) of the four vegetable
soybean genotypes. During the whole growth stages, the Pn of

K high-efficiency genotypes decreased by 6.1–6.9%, while that
of low-efficiency genotypes decreased by 10.9–15.7%. From full
bloom to full seed stage, the Pn increased first and then decreased.
The maximum value occurred at the full pod (R4) stage of the
K low-efficiency genotype Line 36, which reached 28.8 µmol
CO 2 m [−][2] s [−][1] and 33.8 µmol CO 2 m [−][2] s [−][1] under K0 and
K120 treatments, respectively. Meanwhile, from full pod to full
seed stage, the dramatic decline of the Pn was found in K lowefficiency genotypes. The Pn of Line 36 decreased by 87.2% in
K0 and 86.2% in K120 treatment ( _P <_ 0.05), and that of Line 7
decreased by 54.3% in K0 and 59% in K120 treatment. Whereas
the decline of the Pn in K high-efficiency genotypes was around
33.5–51.8% in K0 and 36.7–41.1% in K120 treatment, which was
not as much as that of K low-efficiency genotypes.
Potassium deficiency also decreased the stomatal conductance
(Gs) in all genotypes, but K high-efficiency genotypes were less
affected. The decrease of Gs by K deficiency was 7.5–7.8% in
K high-efficiency genotypes, but 9.4–12.5% in K low-efficiency
genotypes. Low K treatment had the most obvious effect on Gs
at the beginning seed stage.
As opposed to Pn and Gs, K deficiency increased the
intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci), especially in K lowefficiency genotypes. The increase of Ci by K deficiency was
7.3–7.9% in K low-efficiency genotypes, but 2–6% in K highefficiency genotypes.



Potassium deficiency decreased the transpiration rate (Tr)
of all genotypes. Across the five stages, Tr of K high-efficiency
genotypes was around 8.8–9.8 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] in K0 and
9–10.1 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] in K120 treatment, which was
higher than that of 7.1–8.2 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] in K0 and 7.1–
8.6 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] in K120 treatment in K low-efficiency
genotypes. At the full seed stage, higher Tr was found in K highefficiency genotypes with 4–4.5 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] in K0 and
4.2–4.7 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] in K120 treatment, but only 1–
1.2 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] and 1.4 –1.6 mmol H 2 O m [−][2] s [−][1] in
K low-efficiency genotypes.


Chlorophyll
Pot experiment indicated that K deficiency significantly
decreased leaf chlorophyll content of the four vegetable soybean
genotypes ( **Table 4** ). The average total Chl content in the
four growth stages of K high-efficiency genotypes was 2.29–
2.53 mg g [−][1] in K0 and 2.89–2.91 mg g [−][1] in K120 treatment,
which was lower than that of K low-efficiency genotypes
with 2.57–3.2 mg g [−][1] in K0 and 3.08–3.5 mg g [−][1] in K120
treatment. However, K deficiency increased the ratio of Chl
a to Chl b, especially in K high-efficiency genotypes. The
ratio of Chl a to Chl b was increased by 36.2–38.1% in K
high-efficiency genotypes ( _P <_ 0.05), but only by 6–9.8% in K
low-efficiency genotypes.

DISCUSSION


Potassium high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes are
more efficient in root architecture adjustment associated with
higher specific root K uptake rate (total K accumulation/total
root length) to adapt to low K conditions, which ensures an
adequate supply of K (Liu et al., 2019a). Based on these, this
study investigated the root bleeding-sap rate and K upward fluxes

Wang P. et al., 2020). The results indicated that K high-efficiency
vegetable soybean genotypes against low K condition by
increasing root bleeding-sap rate per plant and maintaining
higher root bleeding-sap rate per root length at the beginning
seed stage. The root bleeding-sap rate of K high-efficiency
genotypes in low K stress was 9.9–24.3% greater than that of
normal K conditions, which was accompanied by the relatively
higher K concentration of root bleeding-sap in contributing to
K [+] upward flux. In K high-efficiency cotton cultivars, higher root
bleeding-sap and K upward fluxes could also be induced by low
K stress (Yang, 2011). Suitable grafting would help watermelon
seedlings accumulate more K by increasing root bleeding-sap
volume and the total K in the root bleeding-sap (Huang et al.,
2013). Due to the rate of root bleeding-sap is closely related to
plant nutrient supply, water transport, and even photosynthesis
(Guan et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), increased rate
of root bleeding-sap under K deficiency might be an important
regulatory mechanism for vegetable soybean efficient uptake K.
Besides, beginning seed stage is a most important period for seed
establishment, the higher root bleeding-sap rate per root length
in K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes accompanied
by higher K upward fluxes rate per root length and higher K
concentration of root bleeding-sap is positively correlated with
plant K concentration ( _P <_ 0.05). This is another evidence
demonstrating that the root of K high-efficiency genotypes has a
stronger affinity for K [+] .
Potassium kinetic parameters and root activities are also
important factors assessing K efficiency when plants suffering
low K stress (Silberbush and Barber, 1983; Cui et al., 2016;
White et al., 2018). The present study revealed a lower
Michaelis constant ( _K_ m) and compensation concentration for
K [+] uptake ( _C_ min), and a higher maximum K [+] uptake rate
( _I_ max) from K high-efficiency genotypes, compared with K
low-efficiency genotypes. Lower _K_ m and _C_ min indicate higher
affinity between the roots and K [+] and stronger ability to use



the low-concentration K [+], while higher _I_ max ensures a faster
K uptake rate (Glass, 1980; Teo et al., 1992). The absorption
kinetic parameters of ion uptake are useful indexes of the level
of adaptation of the genotype to the nutrient condition in the
soil (Crowley, 1975; Daniel et al., 2020). The study of Hao et al.
(2015) also recognized that K kinetic parameters could be used to
test crop low-K adaptability. Therefore, it was reasonable to say
that K high-efficiency genotypes had better K adaptability than
K low-efficiency genotypes. On the other hand, root activity is
another important heritable trait in evaluating root absorption
ability, which also influences nutrients acquisition and initial
canopy cover and, thereby, crop yields (Liu et al., 2015; Cui
et al., 2016; White et al., 2018). In the present study, both root
vigor and absorbing activity (including actively absorbing area,
total absorbing area, and the ratio of actively absorbing area to
total absorbing area) were consistently enhanced by low K stress
in K high-efficiency genotypes, while those of K low-efficiency
genotypes are inhibited. This kind of difference can be regulated
by plant phytohormones (Yang, 2011), which were controlled by
specific genes and pathways (Liu et al., 2020). Therefore, K highefficiency genotypes are more adapted to low K stress through
regulating root K affinity drivers, which is beneficial for the
upward flux of nutrients (Liu et al., 2015).
Photosynthetic parameters affected by K levels are direct
references to characterize the photosynthetic capacity of
crops (Wang Y. et al., 2020). Hence, it is important to
examine the photosynthetic characteristics of vegetable
soybean with different K efficiency types. In the present
study, photosynthetic parameters are less affected by low K
in K high-efficiency genotypes. The _Pn_ of K high-efficiency
genotypes decreased by 6.1–6.9% and K low-efficiency
genotypes by 10.9–15.7%. Many investigations also indicate
that crops with high K efficiency should be more efficient in
photosynthesis or that photosynthetic capacity is less affected
by low K stress (Wang et al., 2014). For instance, under K

deficiency, _Pn_ of K-efficient cotton cultivar Liaomian 18 is
19.4% higher than that of K-inefficient cultivar NuCOTN99 [B] .
Besides, photosynthetic parameters of Liaomian 18 were less
affected by low K stress (Wang N. et al., 2012). However,
the present study did not find absolute superiority of _Pn_
in K high-efficiency genotypes, but they have a higher
HI and KHI [the relevant results have been published by
Liu et al. (2019b)]. A high HI is fundamental to efficient
utilization of all resources taken up by the plant, and
the photosynthate transport and distribution rather than
photosynthesis rate are critical for low K adaptation in
K high-efficiency genotypes (Rengel and Damon, 2008;
Hao et al., 2016).



Consistent with photosynthetic parameters, Chl content also
reflects the photosynthetic activity in leaves (Szafra´nska et al.,
2017; Choudhury et al., 2019). In the present study, K highefficiency vegetable soybean genotypes exhibit lower total Chl
content but greater Chl a/b ratio when suffering low K stress.
The effect of photosynthetic photon flux density on the leaf Chl
a/b ratio is one of the most characteristic differences between
sun and shade leaves (Abtahi et al., 2019). Typically, total Chl
content per unit leaf area is lower and the Chl a/b ratio is
greater in sun compared with shade soybean leaves (Anderson,
1986; Fritschi and Ray, 2007). The higher Chl a/b ratio with
enhanced relative content of Chl a in response to low K stress
might be an adapted mechanism for K high-efficiency genotypes

to maintain photosynthetic capacity because Chl a is the main
pigment in leaves that absorbs light energy, which ensures
light absorption as much as possible (Abtahi et al., 2019).
Similar results were also revealed in the research of Wang et al.
(2008). Besides, low K stress decreased leaf K [+] concentration
of vegetable soybean, but K high-efficiency genotypes were
less affected (Liu et al., 2019a). This could be an important
internal factor affecting the chlorophyll regulation ability of K
high-efficiency vegetable soybean. The present study recognized
that the high efficiency of photosynthesis, including more
adaptable photosynthetic parameters and Chl proportion, was
essential for K utilization efficiency in K high-efficiency vegetable
soybean genotypes.
It is root uptake power that drives up nutrients transport,
while photosynthetic capacity and assimilate redistribution
capacity are the key to crop yield (He et al., 2019). In the present
study, K high-efficiency vegetable soybean was found to have
obvious advantages in root K affinity drivers, which ensured the
upward supply of K and other nutrients. Thus, the photosynthetic
system of K high-efficiency genotypes was less susceptible to low
K conditions and has a stronger regulation ability, ensuring the
efficiency of K utilization.


CONCLUSION


The higher affinity of root to K [+] associated with root activity
under low K stress is essential to promote root K absorption.
The strong drivers, represented with higher root bleeding-sap
rate and Tr induced by low K stress, ensure the upward flux
of K [+] and other essential nutrients as much as possible. The
photosynthetic system of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean

genotypes is less affected and reasonably regulated by low K
stress to maintain photosynthates. Therefore, the ability to
redistribute photosynthetic products seemed more important
than photosynthetic capacity in K high-efficiency genotypes
( **Figure 5** ). Overall, crop K high-efficiency should be holistic,
and the factors involved are not isolated. Stronger root K affinity
drivers associated with photosynthetic adaptability to low K stress
were the key factors in determining the K high-efficiency of
vegetable soybeans.
