**Abstract:** The problem of soil fertility imbalance in hilly agriculture is prominent, and accurate
estimation of soil potassium balance is key to achieving precision fertilization at the regional level.
Crop distribution has a significant impact on potassium balance, but studies on potassium balance
with a focus on crop cultivation types are scarce, especially with regard to hilly areas. In this study,
the spatial distribution characteristics of soil potassium balance under different cropping conditions
and its influencing factors were analyzed for a hilly region. The results showed that (1) the soil
rapidly available potassium (RAK) and slowly available potassium (SAK) content in the 0–20 cm soil
layer ranged from 29.37 to 122.07 mg kg _[−]_ [1] and from 472.31 to 772.77 mg kg _[−]_ [1], respectively. (2) The
soil potassium equilibrium status varied considerably among different cropping systems and the
soil potassium deficit was greatest under the rapeseed–maize rotation, reaching _−_ 129.50 kg K ha _[−]_ [1]

yr _[−]_ [1] . The difference in soil potassium deficits between the rice–rapeseed and wheat–maize rotations
was not significant, at _−_ 46.79 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] and _−_ 44.07 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1], respectively, and only
the rice–wheat rotation showed a potassium surplus. Due to the low potassium absorption of crops,
the equilibrium value of soil potassium is higher than that of crop rotation, and rice and wheat can
achieve different degrees of potassium surplus. Rapeseed planting was generally under-applied
with potassium, and the potassium deficit could reach _−_ 70 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] . (3) Climate, topography,
anthropogenic activity, and soil available potassium explained 20.8% of the variance in soil potassium
balance. Anthropogenic activity such as roads and population density had the greatest influence,
with 0.797. Topography and average annual precipitation had the weakest influences. These findings
emphasize the importance of anthropogenic activity for soil potassium balance, and also provide
regional evidence for formulating efficient measures for regional potassium resources management.

**1. Introduction**


Hilly landscapes, as one of the five major terrestrial geomorphological types globally,
play a critical role in agricultural production. Soil nutrient management in hilly areas
becomes particularly crucial because hilly agriculture is susceptible to soil fertility imbalances. Exploring the characteristics of fertility balance and its influencing mechanisms is
important for scientific management of hilly agriculture. Potassium (K) plays an important
role in plant growth, and its deficiency or absence has a significant impact on normal
plant growth and development, cellular metabolism, and resistance to insect pests [ 1, 2 ].
Although potassium is one of the most abundant nutrients in soil, soil potassium distribution shows strong spatial heterogeneity due to the high spatial and temporal variability
in soil resources [ 3 – 5 ]. Fertilization is the most direct and effective way to augment and
regulate soil potassium content [ 6 – 8 ]. However, differences in nutrient inputs, climatic
and soil conditions, different crop assortment, and yield level all affect crop demand for



_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_ [, 15348. https://doi.org/10.3390/su152115348](https://doi.org/10.3390/su152115348) [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability)

potassium and its soil outflow, both of which ultimately affect the potassium balance [ 9 ].
Therefore, understanding the soil potassium balance in a soil–crop system is a priority when
attempting to ensure a stable and high yield of crops and achieve efficient management of
potassium resources.
Soil potassium balance is a measure of the sum of potassium inflows and outflows
within a particular framework [ 10, 11 ]. Currently, there are two main types of research
on potassium balance in farmland soil both domestically and internationally: soil potassium balance based on crop soil fertilization experiments, and soil potassium balance
estimation based on statistical or survey data. For instance, based on a field study,
Li et al. [ 12 ] demonstrated that zeolite amendments alleviated negative potassium balances, and Zhang et al. [ 13 ] found that high straw return with fertilization improved soil
potassium supply and potassium balance, compared to no fertilization or low straw return
conditions. These studies provide practical ways to improve potassium balance, but do not
reveal the statuses of regional potassium balances. In contrast, Linquist et al. [ 14 ] assessed
soil potassium balance (average value was _−_ 15 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] ) in commercial rice fields
across California based on historical information provided by growers, and Liu et al. [ 15 ]
analyzed temporal and spatial changes in the potassium balance of farmland in China
from 1980 to 2015 using statistical data and related parameters. Although previous studies
have obtained the total provincial soil potassium balance, which is of some significance
in guiding regional fertilization, they did not take into account the spatial variation in
soil potassium balance within a region due to crop distribution. Previous research on soil
potassium spatial characteristics has mainly focused on spatial variation in soil potassium
fertility and analysis of influencing factors [ 3, 4, 12 ], but has paid less attention to the spatial mapping of soil potassium balance in terms of regional crop distribution. However,
when assessing the nutrient balance of the farmland in a region, the spatial distribution
of regional crops can often better represent the regional farmland’s nutrient balance and
shows the regional farmland’s nutrient surplus and deficit situation in a more realistic way.
Therefore, considering the fact that planting structure has an important effect on potassium distribution but few studies have quantified it, especially in hilly areas where soil
fertility exchanges are more frequent, this study attempted to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of soil potassium balance under different cropping conditions in a hilly
region. Shehong County, Suining City, located in the core hilly area of Sichuan Province,
possessing typical hilly agriculture, was selected as the study area. Multi-temporal Sentinel2 satellite images and the decision-tree classification method were used to extract the spatial
distribution of major crops in the study area. The spatial distribution pattern for soil potassium content was also assessed using soil sampling data. The spatial distribution pattern
of soil potassium content was evaluated through soil sampling data, and further combined
with the spatial distribution of regional crops. Based on a consideration of different forms
of soil potassium input and soil potassium output, the potassium balance characteristics of
farmland soil in the study area were calculated, and their spatial distribution differences
and influencing factors were analyzed, in order to provide references for rational potassium
fertilizer application and improving soil potassium utilization efficiency in the region.


**2. Materials and Methods**

_2.1. Study Area_


Due to the diverse planting structure and complex terrain conditions in hilly areas,
the management of soil potassium in these areas is often difficult. Therefore, the study
of potassium balance in hilly areas is particularly important. This study was conducted
in Shehong County, Sichuan Province, China, which is dominated by hilly terrain and
lies between 105 _[◦]_ 10 _[′]_ E–105 _[◦]_ 40 _[′]_ E and 30 _[◦]_ 37 _[′]_ N–31 _[◦]_ 12 _[′]_ N (Figure 1). The altitude within
the territory ranges from 280 m to 664 m, and is high in the northwest and low in the
southeast. This area belongs to the subtropical humid climate zone and has a mild climate.
The county covers 1496 km [2] and is a rich agricultural resource. Its total arable land area is
70,060.87 hm [2] . According to China Soil System Classification (1995), the main soil-forming


_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 3 of 16


parent materials in this region are the Penglai Group soils and three gray-brown alluviumcovered soil types (purplish soils, paddy soils, and alluvial soils), and the main crop types
are rice, corn, wheat, and rape.


**Figure 1.** The location of the study area in Sichuan Province.


_2.2. Soil Sample Collection and Laboratory Analysis_


Potential sampling points were first identified indoors based on soil type, soil-forming
parent material, and topographic factors. Then, based on reachability and the actual state
of the sampling sites, 56 sampling points were identified (Figure 2). A global positioning
system device was used to measure geographic coordinates and elevation at each location. Crop cultivation and other information for each site was also collected during field
investigation. Three soil cores were randomly collected from each site using a standard
Edelman auger with a diameter of 7 cm, and each soil sample weighed approximately
1 kg. The samples were air-dried, after thorough homogenization and removal of roots and
stone, and finely ground to pass through a sieve with openings smaller than 2 mm. Soil
rapidly available potassium (RAK) was leached with 1.0 mol L _[−]_ [1] neutral NH 4 OAC at a 10:1
water–soil ratio and slowly available potassium (SAK) was leached with 1 mol L _[−]_ [1] boiling
HNO 3 at a 10:1 water–soil ratio. The filtrate of soil sample solution was measured using


_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 4 of 16


the flame photometric method [ 16 ]. Soil available potassium (AK) was the summation of
RAK and SAK.

_2.3. Cropping Pattern Extraction_


Many sophisticated supervised classification algorithms have been developed to identify crop types with multiple vegetation indices [ 17 ]. Among them, the decision tree method
is widely used to identify crop planting structure due to its high computational efficiency
and strong regional applicability. Therefore, a decision tree classification process was
designed to achieve a simple, fast, and accurate extraction of crop patterns (Figure 3). First,
the cloud-free Sentinel-2 L1C images from May 2018 to April 2019 were reprocessed using
radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and resampling. The normalized difference
vegetation index (NDVI) and modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI), which
are based on the phonological differences among rice, maize, wheat, and oilseed rape, were
used to classify the croplands. The crop samples were constructed by combining visual
interpretations of the images with field investigation. Finally, the decision tree was trained
using the selected samples and classification features.

_2.4. Calculation of On-Farm Potassium Balance_


The input of farmland potassium includes: (1) Chemical fertilizer application: the
survey data, provided by the County Agricultural Bureau, the Statistics Bureau, visiting
farmers, etc. The amount of field fertilizer application collected in this study is the compound fertilizer application amount, which does not include nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus
fertilizer, etc., and has been converted into the input amount of potassium fertilizer (K 2 O).
Due to the organic fertilizer input from livestock and poultry manure and the fertilizer
range of the main grain crops in the study area being small, in this study, the input of
organic manure from livestock and poultry manure for main grain crops was measured
as 0; (2) Potassium amount brought into farmland by rainfall: the average value was
obtained via reference literature. The annual averages for potassium in rice–rape, rice–
wheat, single-season rice, and the other planting systems were 15.1 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 18 ],
13.3 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 18 ], 6.5 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 18 ], and 8.3 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 19 ], respectively.
(3) The amount of potassium deriving from irrigation water. The total potassium input was
determined according to the total amount of irrigation water and the potassium content
of the irrigation water. The potassium amount in rice–rape, rice–wheat and single-season
rice through irrigation water was calculated as 23.25 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 18 ], 17.6 kg K ha _[−]_ [1]

yr _[−]_ [1] [ 18 ], 17.8 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 18 ], respectively, and 14.8 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 19 ] under other
planting systems; (4) Soil potassium deriving from returning crop straw to the field: the
rate of returning crop straw to the field in the study area was 48.8% [ 20 ] and the potassium
nutrient content of the straw was 1.9%, 0.99%, 1.16%, and 2.01% [ 21 ] for rice, maize, wheat,
and oilseed rape, respectively.
Without considering the loss of fertilizer, the potassium outputs from a farm consist
of the amount of leaching and the amount of potassium uptake required for the desired
economic yield of the crop. In this study, the loss of soil potassium was mainly caused in
paddy fields, so the amount of leaching was considered to be 10 kg ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] [ 19 ] and
potassium uptake by a crop was calculated using Equation (1):


_n_
### K = ∑ Y ∗ AKi / Si (1)

_i_ = 1


where _K_ is the potassium nutrient content (K 2 O) per unit area of crop uptake, kg hm _[−]_ [2] ; _i_ is
the value when the crop is present; _Y_ is the economic yield for a crop, and _AK_ is the amount
of potassium nutrients required per unit economic yield of various crops. In this study, the
amount of potassium nutrients required per unit economic yield of rice, wheat, maize, and
rape production were 26.3 kg t _[−]_ [1], 24.7 kg t _[−]_ [1], 21.6 kg t _[−]_ [1], and 58.1 kg t _[−]_ [1], respectively. _Si_
is the sown area of each crop, which was obtained from the statistical yearbook.
Soil potassium balance is the difference between soil potassium input and soil potassium output, i.e., soil potassium balance = potassium input—potassium output.


_2.5. Spatial Analysis of Potassium Balance Based on Ordinary Kriging_


Ordinary kriging is a linear geostationary method that produces a good interpolation when the soil dataset is normally distributed and meets the second-order smooth
assumption or quasi-second-order smooth assumption. In this study, a normality test, a
global trend test, and a spatial autocorrelation test were performed using ArcGIS10.6 (Esri,
Redlands, CA, USA) to remove outliers and trend effects. Ordinary kriging interpolation
was then performed for RAK and SAK based on the parameters from the best fitted semivariance model. The interpolation performance was evaluated using the cross-validation
method with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE).

_2.6. The Relationships between Environmental Factors and Potassium Balance_
2.6.1. Environmental Factors Acquisition


The climatic data, which consisted of mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean
annual precipitation (MAP), were obtained from the National Meteorological Information
[Center (http://data.cma.cn/site/index.html, accessed on 10 June 2020).](http://data.cma.cn/site/index.html)
The DEM data were derived from ASTER GDEM V2 global digital elevation data
[downloaded from the Geospatial Data Cloud (http://www.gscloud.cn/, accessed on](http://www.gscloud.cn/)
10 June 2020) with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Two topographic factors, regional slope and
terrain relief, were extracted using the ArcGIS spatial analysis module.
The vector data for county-level administrative divisions, roads, and rivers were
obtained from the National Geographic Information Resources Catalog Service System
[(http://www.webmap.cn/, accessed on 10 June 2020) and the population density grid data](http://www.webmap.cn/)
were obtained from the shared service platform of the National Earth System Science Data
[Center (http://www.geodata.cn/, accessed on 10 June 2020).](http://www.geodata.cn/)


2.6.2. Effects of Environmental Factors on Potassium Balance


Firstly, the area was graded to generate a 500 m _×_ 500 m grid pattern and soil potassium input, potassium output, potassium balance, and crop areas of different crop fields
within the grid were determined. The environmental factors, such as MAT, MAP, elevation,
slope, topographic relief, average road density, and average population density, were then
extracted within the grid. Correlations between the environmental factors and potassium
balance were analyzed using SPSS data analysis software (IBM SPSS Statistics19, IBM,
Somers, NY, USA). MAT and MAP were categorized as climatic factors. Elevation, slope,
and topographic relief were categorized as topographic factors, whereas average road
density and average population density were categorized as anthropogenic activity factors.
The structural equation model (SEM) was constructed from these potassium balance indicators using AMOS software (IBM PSAS AMOS 21, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) to predict
the interactions between soil potassium balance and environmental factors such as climate,
topography, anthropogenic activity, and AK content of the soil.
The SEM used several model fitness parameters to judge the reasonableness of the
model. These were chi-square ( χ [2] ), degrees of freedom (df), gradient, root mean square error
of approximation (RMSEA), and the goodness-of-fit index (GFI). The chi-square ( χ [2] ) test,
degrees of freedom (df), gradient index, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA),
and goodness-of-fit index (GFI) are critical metrics in evaluating a model. Specifically,
the chi-square ( χ [2] ) test gauges the divergence between observed and model-predicted
data. A significant χ [2] value indicates that the model does not adequately represent the
observed data, necessitating adjustments in model structure or parameters. Degrees of
freedom (df) measure the model _[′]_ s complexity by indicating how many parameters can
be freely modified. A lower df value relative to sample size suggests a simpler model,
thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Meanwhile, the gradient index helps assess the
degree of maximum likelihood optimization in the model; a smaller gradient signifies
better optimization, while a larger one suggests the need for further refinement. RMSEA
evaluates the model _[′]_ s fit quality, accounting for its complexity, and assesses the closeness
between the model-predicted and actual observed covariance matrices. Lower RMSEA
values imply a better fit, while higher values suggest the contrary. Lastly, the GFI offers a
comprehensive assessment, reflecting how closely the model _[′]_ s predicted covariance matrix
aligns with the observed one. A higher GFI score indicates a better model fit. Collectively,
these metrics serve as a multi-faceted framework for evaluating structural equation models
(SEM), aiding in determining model plausibility, identifying areas for improvement, and
verifying the model _[′]_ s accuracy for interactions between environmental factors and soil
potassium balance. The formulae of χ [2], RMSEA, GFI are as follows [22]:


_χ_ [2] = ( _N_ _−_ 1 ) / _f_ (2)

In the formulae: _N_, sample size; _f_, minimized discrepancy function; _df_, degrees of
freedom; _ρ_, number of observed variables. When these parameters satisfied χ [2] /df < 3,
RMSEA < 0.08, and GFI > 0.9, then the model was considered to be reasonably fit.


**3. Results**

_3.1. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Cropping Patterns_


The spatial distributions of the main four crop types were extracted from the decision
tree. The extraction accuracy for rice, maize, rape, and wheat were 89.36%, 87.16%, 87.85%,
and 84.65%, respectively, when compared to the Statistical Yearbook. The extraction areas
were 9705.22 ha, 16,147.55 ha, 5443.56 ha, and 17,414.04 ha for rice, maize, rape, and
wheat, respectively, and the maize and wheat cultivation areas were much greater than
those of rice and rape (Figure 4). The distributions of the rice–rape rotation, rice–wheat
rotation, rape–maize rotation, and wheat–maize rotation areas were obtained using the
spatially overlaid method. The rice–rape rotation, rice–wheat rotation, rape–maize rotation,
and wheat–maize rotation areas were 896.76 ha, 1868.92 ha, 833.48 ha, and 2106.52 ha,
~~respectively. Maize and wheat were the main cultivated crops in the study area and the~~ y
accounted for the largest crop areas in every township.

proportions of different crop systems in different districts and counties.


_3.2. Spatial Distribution of Soil Available Potassium_


The spatial distributions of soil RAK and SAK in the study area were determined by
kriging interpolation (Figure 5). Kriging performed well in providing reliable estimates of
spatial distributions of RAK and SAK, with MSE lower than 0.04 and RMMSE closer to 1.
The value of RAK content ranged from 29.37 to 122.07 mg kg _[−]_ [1], with an average value of
63.63 mg kg _[−]_ [1], and the soil SAK content ranged from 472.31 to 772.77 mg kg _[−]_ [1], with an
average value of 649.77 mg kg _[−]_ [1] (Table 1). According to the fertility grading standard of
the second national soil census, the soil RAK content in the study area was classified as low
level, and the soil SAK was generally at a low or moderate level. The spatial distribution of
soil RAK was generally characterized as high in the central townships and low in the north
and south townships, similarly to the spatial distribution of soil SAK.

Note: RAK means rapid available potassium; SAK means slowly available potassium; AVG means average value;
MSE means mean standardized error; RMSSE means root mean square standardized error.


The nugget effects of RAK and SAK were greater than 50%, revealing strong spatial
variability of soil available potassium, which indicated that anthropogenic activity, such as
cropping pattern and field fertilization, had a greater influence than natural environmental
factors. The nugget effect of SAK was 53.72%, which was lower than that of RAK, suggesting that SAK was less influenced by anthropogenic activity because its morphology is more
~~stable and it includes the part that could not be directly absorbed and utilized by crops.~~


_3.3. Spatial Distribution of Soil Potassium Balance_


The results for the different sources of soil potassium showed that they were significantly different under the various cropping patterns (Table 2). Specifically, under the same
cropping pattern, the overall order for potassium input from the different sources was
straw return > irrigation water > rainfall input. All three sources of potassium input, i.e.,
rainfall input, irrigation water, and straw, were highest in the rice–rapeseed rotation, at
15.10, 23.30, and 57.91 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1], respectively. However, rainfall input was lowest
for the rice monoculture (6.50 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] ) and irrigation water was lowest under the
maize monoculture, wheat monoculture, rapeseed monoculture, rapeseed–maize rotation,
and wheat–maize rotation (14.80 kg K ha ~~_[−]_~~ ~~[1]~~ yr ~~_[−]_~~ ~~[1]~~ ). The potassium input from straw was
lowest under the wheat monoculture (13.73 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] ).

Rape–maize rotation 8.3 14.8 34.58
Wheat–maize rotation 8.3 14.8 29.28


The total soil potassium input and the potassium inputs from each township were
~~counted. The results showed that the annual potassium input mostly ranged from 63.83 to~~
100 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] in the study area. There were a few areas where the annual potassium
input was greater than 220 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] (Figure 6a). The areas with an annual potassium
input of less than 100 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] were mainly located in the hilly townships at the
edge of the study area and the areas > kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] were mainly in the central part of
the study area.


**Figure 6.** Spatial distribution maps of potassium input ( **a** ), potassium output ( **b** ), and potassium
balance ( **c** ).


The data on potassium uptake by crops were obtained from the literature rather than
field measurements and differences between crop varieties were not considered. This
meant that cropping pattern was the main reason for the spatial distribution differences
in potassium output (Figure 6b). Annual soil potassium output in the study area mostly
ranged from 100–204 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] and the potassium output of each township ranged
from 129.27–144.33 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] .
The soil potassium balance for farmland ranged from _−_ 187.22 to 101.81 kg K ha _[−]_ [1]

yr _[−]_ [1] and the largest soil potassium deficit was in the southwest of the study area. Soil
potassium achieved balance in the northeast and was in surplus in the central part of the
study area, with a maximum of 101.81 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] (Figure 6). The soil potassium
balance results for the different cropping patterns showed that the rapeseed–maize rotation
had the most severe deficit at 129.50 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] (Table 3). The difference in soil
potassium deficit between the rice–rapeseed and wheat–maize rotations was not significant,
at 46.79 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] and 44.07 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1], respectively. Only the rice–wheat rotation
showed a potassium surplus. Low potassium uptake by crops in the monoculture systems
~~meant that the soil potassium balance was higher for the monoculture systems than for the~~


_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 10 of 16


rotation systems. The oilseed rape areas were generally deficient in potassium by around
–70.12 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1], which was a higher deficit than those of the rice–rapeseed and
wheat–maize rotations.

_3.4. Analysis of Factors Influencing Potassium Balance in Farmland Soils_


Table 4 presents the average balance values of soil potassium within a 500-m grid,
as well as its relationships with the average values of associated influencing factors. The
research area is divided grid-by-grid, with each grid serving as a sample point. Through
correlation analysis of these sample points, we identified the correlation between soil
potassium balance and various influencing factors, as shown in Table 4. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that all environmental factors except MAT showed significant
or highly significant correlations with soil potassium balance (Table 4). Therefore, MAP,
elevation, slope, population density, road density, and AK content were incorporated into
the subsequent analysis.

The slope direction and topographic factor variables were not significant, so they
were excluded from the SEM model. The overall fit index of the final SEM model was
χ [2] /df = 1.392, RMSEA = 0.009, and GFI = 1.000 (Figure 7), which satisfied the requirements
for goodness of fit between the theoretical model and the data ( χ [2] /df < 2, RMSEA < 0.1,
GFI > 0.9), indicating that the constructed model was reliable. The contribution made by
the environmental factors to the soil potassium balance was 20.8% (Figure 7). Specifically,
the topographic factor had a direct positive effect of 0.243 on the potassium balance and
indirect effects of _−_ 0.263, 0.063, and 0.011 for the anthropogenic activity factor, average
annual precipitation, and soil AK content, respectively. Therefore, the total effect of the
topographic factor on the potassium balance was 0.053. The anthropogenic activity factor
had a direct positive effect of 0.559 on the potassium balance. Its indirect positive effect on

the potassium balance through its effects on soil AK was 0.238, leading to a total effect on
the potassium balance of 0.797. However, MAP had a direct negative effect of _−_ 0.100 on
the potassium balance and an indirect negative effect of _−_ 0.029 through its effect on soil
AK content, resulting in a total effect of _−_ 0.129 on the potassium balance. The soil AK had
a direct positive effect of 0.408 on the potassium balance.

**4. Discussion**


In this study, both the NDVI and the MCARI were used to construct the decisiontree-based crop distribution extraction model. Rice and maize have different climatic
characteristics, which means that they are well distinguished by the NDVI during their
different growth periods [ 23 ]. Wheat and oilseed rape are similar to each other due to
their growth cycles, which means that it is not appropriate to use the NDVI to distinguish
between them. However, wheat and rape were separated by applying MCARI thresholds,
which can discern significant differences between wheat and rape during their growth
cycles [ 24 ]. The final extraction accuracies of the four crops, i.e., rice, maize, oilseed rape,
and wheat, were more than 85%, indicating that the decision tree constructed in this study
performed well [ 25 ]. The maize and wheat areas in the study area were much larger than
the rice and oilseed rape areas, while the extracted crop rotation area was lower, which is
probably due to local planting history, soil properties, and other factors [26].
The mean value for soil RAK in the study area was 63.63 mg kg _[−]_ [1] (Table 1), the mean
soil RAK in the Yujiang hilly area of Jiangxi is 74.00 mg kg _[−]_ [1] [ 27 ], and the Pearl River
Delta hilly area value is 77.80 mg kg _[−]_ [1] [ 28 ], which are all below the potassium deprivation
threshold of 80 mg kg _[−]_ [1] [ 4 ]. This is mainly due to the long history of intensive cropping
activity in the hilly areas of China. Crops such as maize, rape, and rice have high potassium
demands for growth. However, potassium fertilizer inputs have been neglected for a
long time in the areas in which these crops are grown, and this has led to the depletion
of potassium reserves in the soil [ 9, 29, 30 ]. SAK, an important component of the soil AK
reserve, is dynamically converted from partially slowly available to RAK when the soil
is deficient in RAK [ 31 ]. However, soil SAK content in the study area was generally low
or moderate, indicating the need for exogenous supplemental potassium inputs to meet
crop-growth requirements. The spatial distribution of soil RAK in the study area showed
that it was generally at a high level in the central townships and low in the northern and
southern townships, suggesting that factors such as crop cultivation, field fertilization,
and topography may have caused intra-regional differences in potassium content. SAK
content was significantly high in central and east townships and low in the north and


_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 12 of 16


south townships, mainly because its more stable nature is significantly influenced by
natural factors.

In various crop rotation systems, significant differences exist in the sources of soil
potassium, such as straw recycling, irrigation water, and rainfall input. Taking the rice–
rapeseed rotation model as an example, all sources of potassium input are highest in this
system, particularly straw recycling, which contributes up to 57.91 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1] . This
high input is likely attributable to the abundant organic matter provided by straw recycling,
thereby elevating the potassium content in the soil [ 32 ]. Specific fertilizer management
practices may have been adopted in the rice–rapeseed rotation model, as existing research
demonstrates that appropriate use of potassium fertilizers can increase soil potassium
levels [ 33 ]. Concurrently, soil types also influence potassium content and availability. For
instance, clay soils usually retain potassium more effectively than sandy soils, which might
lead to potassium leaching [ 34 ]. This study found that the most severe potassium deficiency
occurred in the rapeseed–maize rotation model, while the deficiency was comparably mild
in the rice–rapeseed and wheat–maize rotation models; only the rice–wheat rotation model
showed a surplus of potassium. These variations are likely due to the differential demand
and utilization efficiency of potassium among various crops and also depend on the stage
of crop growth [ 35 ]. Lastly, compared to monoculture systems, crops in rotation systems
generally exhibit higher demand for and utilization of potassium. In monoculture systems,
crops usually have lower potassium uptake, resulting in a higher soil potassium balance.
This, in turn, affects the overall soil potassium balance in the system [9,36].
In general, the higher the altitude, the lower the temperature, which is not conducive
to the normal growth of crops such as maize, rape, and rice [ 37 ], and the greater the slope,
the more severe the soil erosion and the greater the labor input required [ 38, 39 ]. Thus,
the high altitude and slope topographic factors lead to reduced cropping activity and
decreased potassium export, whereas topography is significantly and positively correlated
with potassium balance (Figure 7). In addition, topography is one of the determinants of soil
water, nutrients, and temperature redistribution in certain regions [ 40, 41 ]; therefore, it also
has an indirect effect on potassium balance by affecting natural factors, such as MAP and
soil AK content. For example, Liu et al. [ 42 ] showed that precipitation on the northeastern
slope of the Tibetan Plateau was negatively related to altitude. Furthermore, sufficient
precipitation can enhance crop productivity and thus potassium uptake [ 43 ], but it can
also increase AK leaching loss from soil [ 3, 44 ]; therefore, precipitation has a negative effect
on soil AK content and potassium balance. Anthropogenic factors influence soil AK and
potassium balance mainly through planting intensity and fertilizer management. On the
one hand, the greater the road density, the more convenient the agricultural mechanization
operation [ 45 ], while higher population density leads to greater food demand. Thus, high
road and population densities increase crop planting intensity and aggravate potassium
output. But, on the other hand, increased road density also promotes fertilizer management
activity, and potassium fertilizer applications directly increase potassium inputs and the
effective soil potassium content. Ultimately, the results from this study show that the
combined effects of topography, precipitation, and anthropogenic factors led to soil AK
content having a highly significant positive effect on potassium balance.
In the present study, topography, anthropogenic activities, precipitation, and soil
effective potassium content explained 20.8% of the variation in potassium balance, but
79.2% remained unexplained. This unexplained portion may be related to differences
in soil particle composition, basic chemical properties, and mineralogical characteristics.
Soil particles are the basic structure of the soil porous medium and their composition is
closely linked to the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil. Previous studies
have reported that fine particles (clay and powder) are the physical conservators of soil
potassium and that the proportion of fine particles is an important factor controlling the
variation of soil potassium content [ 46, 47 ]. Zhuang et al. [ 48 ] pointed out that during
seepage, fine particles migrate between large voids, leading to soil physical erosion, and the
loss of potassium ions leads to chemical dissolution. Furthermore, soil particle composition


_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 13 of 16


can also have an impact on crop growth [ 49 ]. For example, Huang et al. [ 50 ] showed that
plant numbers and biomass were significantly greater in finer-grained soils. In addition, as
important indicators of basic soil properties, adequate soil cation exchange, soil organic
matter levels, and an appropriate pH not only ensure normal plant growth, but also
influence soil potassium fixation and uptake capacity through ion exchange with Al [3+], Ca [2+],
and Mg [2+] [ 51 ]. Similarly, clay minerals can be involved in potassium balance processes
through ion exchange, dissolution release, and colloidal sorption [ 9, 52, 53 ], and the effects
of different types of minerals on soil potassium are not uniform. For instance, 2:1 clay
minerals are generally a reservoir of potassium in the soil, but are converted to vermiculite,
chlorite, etc., when potassium becomes depleted [ 54 ]. Therefore, the above unexplained
factors may have contributed to the fact that only 20.8% of variation in potassium balance
was fully explained in the structural equation model, and should be explored in depth in
future studies.


**5. Conclusions**


In this study, the spatial structure of the main crops within the study area was extracted using a decision tree algorithm based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2A imagery. The
accuracy for crop extraction ranged from 84.65% to 89.36%, as compared to data from the
Statistical Yearbook. The average amount of readily available potassium (RAK) in the soil
was 63.63 mg kg _[−]_ [1], while that of slowly available potassium (SAK) stood at 649.77 mg kg _[−]_ [1] .
The spatial distribution patterns of both RAK and SAK in the soil predominantly exhibited
high levels in the central townships and lower concentrations in the northern and southern
townships. The soil potassium balance outcomes for various cropping patterns varied
from _−_ 187.22 to 101.81 kg K ha _[−]_ [1] yr _[−]_ [1], with the rape–maize rotation showing the most
significant potassium deficit. Climate, topography, human activity, and soil AK together
explained about 20% of the variation in soil potassium balance. Unexplained variations in
the results are likely attributable to the omission of additional crops, such as vegetables
and sweet potatoes. The differences in potassium input and output patterns for these
unaccounted crops, as compared to the crops identified through remote sensing images,
may have had some impact on the study results. Furthermore, the unexplained variation
may also be attributed to the fact that the calculated potassium inputs and outputs were
primarily derived from pertinent literature and field surveys, without taking into account
the contribution of soil potassium supplementation through organic fertilizers, such as
livestock and poultry manure. Hence, future studies should aim to acquire more precise
data regarding regional cropping patterns and the specific parameters employed in potassium balance calculations. This would help to better elucidate the factors affecting soil
potassium balance and establish a solid theoretical foundation for the precise management
of soil potassium fertility.
