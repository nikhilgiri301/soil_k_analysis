**Continuous potassium (K) removal without replenishment is progressively mining Argentinean soils.**
**Our goals were to evaluate the sensitivity of soil-K to K budgets, quantify soil-K changes over time**
**along the soil profile, and identify soil variables that regulate soil-K depletion. Four on-farm trials**
**under two crop rotations including maize, wheat and soybean were evaluated. Three treatments**
**were compared: (1) control (no fertilizer applied); (2) application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur**
**fertilizers -NPS-; and (3) pristine condition. After nine years, crops removed from 258 to 556 kg K ­ha** **[−1]** **.**
**Only two sites showed a decline in the exchangeable-K levels at 0–20 cm but unrelated to K budget.**
**Topsoil exchangeable-K levels under agriculture resulted 48% lower than their pristine conditions,**
**although still above response levels. Both soil exchangeable-K and slowly-exchangeable K vertical**
**distribution patterns (0–100 cm) displayed substantial depletion relative to pristine conditions, mainly**
**concentrated at subsoil (20–100 cm), with 55–83% for exchangeable-K, and 74–95% for slowly-**
**exchangeable-K. Higher pristine levels of exchangeable-K and slowly-exchangeable-K and lower clay**
**and silt contents resulted in higher soil-K depletion. Soil K management guidelines should consider**
**both topsoil and subsoil nutrient status and variables related to soil K buffer capacity.**


Potassium (K) is an essential macronutrient required by crops, which exhibit a broad range of K requirements
(40–300 kg ­ha [−1] ­year [−1] ) and K removal from the harvested ­product [1] . Wheat ( _Triticum aestivum_ L.) and maize
( _Zea mays_ L.) crops export around 3 kg K ­Mg [−1], whereas soybean ( _Glycine max_ L.) exports 16 kg K ­Mg [−1][2][–][4] .
The main source of plant K is the soil, where K is distributed in four different pools: (1) soil solution K, (2)
exchangeable K ­(NH 4 -OAc-K), (3) slowly exchangeable K ­(NaBPh 4 -K), and (4) K-bearing primary ­minerals [5][–][7] .
The soil solution-K and NH4-OAc-K fractions are the most readily available K source to plants. Thus, fertilizer
recommendations are mostly based on these ­fractions [8] . The NaBPh4-K pool includes less available K fractions
albeit has received more attention for diagnosing K fertilization needs during the last ­decades [9][–][11] . Finally, the
mineral-K is a recalcitrant soil K fraction, usually not considered for K diagnosing purposes.
Potassium can be acquired from all soil layers explored by plant roots, depending on the crop species and
on vertical distribution of plant available ­K [12] . Although root mass is concentrated at topsoil, maize root mass
was reported as poorly correlated with root activity, which can remain high until 60 cm ­depth [13] . Spring cereals
might take up to 80% of the K from the 0–25 cm ­layer [14], while soybeans may take about to 60% of the K from
the 0–30 cm ­layer [15] .
Studies at a global scale indicate that the stratification towards the topsoil is less marked for K than for other
major nutrients such as phosphorus and ­nitrogen [16] . Thus, only a portion of the soil K available for plants is
captured if soil samples are collected from the topsoil (i.e. 0–20 cm depth) [17] . This underestimation is reduced
in those soils with a high topsoil K ­stratification [14] . Stratification normally occurs when K fertilizer is applied in
the ­topsoil [18], as well as when roots uptake K from deeper soil layers and residues are deposited in the ­topsoil [16] .
This process is enhanced in fertilized and high-yielding systems, involving a high deposition of plant residues
such as in no-tillage ­systems [19] .
Most agricultural soils of the Argentine Pampas are characterized by high native soil K linked to the clay
mineralogy (predominantly illite) of the parental ­material [20] . Positive yield responses to K fertilization have been
rarely observed in the region so far; thus, fertilizer K applications have been negligible during the Argentinean
agricultural era, which started around 100 years ago. However, continuous K removal via harvest is gradually

depleting soil K ­reservoir [21] . Under comparable negative K budgets in Pampean soils, greater ­NH 4 -OAc reductions (46% vs. 8%) at the topsoil were found in soils with high- (900 mg ­kg [−1] ) relative to low-initial (600 mg ­kg [−1] )
­NH 4 -OAc-K ­levels [22] . However, most of Pampean soils are still above the ­NH 4 -OAc-K critical level (about
130–170 mg K ­kg [−1] ) [21] .
The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of contrasting K removal on soil K fractions along the soil
profile. We hypothesize that: (1) in high native K soils, the topsoil (0–20 cm) ­NH 4 -OAc test is not sensitive to
identify short-medium term K depletion trends; (2) vertical distribution patterns of both ­NH 4 -OAc-K and
­NaBPh 4 -K are affected by the agricultural footprint, with a significant depletion expected to occur beyond the
topsoil (0–20 cm); and (3) soil K deviates from the Pristine conditions depending on soil factors related to K
buffer capacity such as soil texture and indigenous richness of soil K, with more depletion expected to occur for
both K fractions with coarser textures and high pristine soil K levels.


**Results**
**Cumulative K budget.** Cumulative K budget reflects continuous K removal, without K fertilization. The
high-yielding system, NPS treatment (Fig. 1), significantly increased K removal, with an average annual K
removal ranging from − 29 to − 62 kg K ­ha [−1] ­year [−1] . After more than 10 harvests, the cumulative K budget
for the Control varied from − 258 to − 421 kg K ­ha [−1] and for the NPS ranged from − 467 to − 556 kg K ­ha [−1]
(Fig. 1). San Alfredo, La Blanca and La Hansa sites presented comparable K removal on Control plots (− 330
to − 421 kg K ­ha [−1] ), whereas Balducchi exhibited lower K removal (− 258 kg K ­ha [−1] ). Cumulative removal at the
NPS resulted similar across sites (− 467 to − 556 kg K ­ha [−1] ). Differences in K removal are largely explained by
final yields, with lower yield for the Control in Balducchi but with similar yield for the NPS relative to the other
sites (average 1.9 vs. 3.2 Mg ­ha [−1], with larger yield gap for Control and NPS, respectively).


**Topsoil ­NH** **4** **‑OAc‑K changes.** The evolution of ­NH 4 -Oac-K in the topsoil (0–20 cm) was site-specific
(Fig. 1). The sites with longest agricultural history at the beginning of the experiment (Balducchi and La Hansa),
presented significant ­NH 4 -OAc-K reductions from 2000 to 2009. The opposite occurred in those sites with
shorter farming history at the beginning of the experiment (< 10 year: San Alfredo and La Blanca), with no differences between initial and final NH4-OAc-K levels. Surprisingly, no differences were detected between Control
and NPS in any case (Fig. 1, Table 2). Thus, the lack of change or negligible reductions in topsoil ­NH 4 -OAc-K
over cropping seasons did not correspond with the increasingly negative K budgets.


**Vertical distribution patterns of soil ­KNH** **4** **‑OAcK.** The ­NH 4 -OAcK fraction was predominantly
located (range 72–86%) in the subsoil (20–100 cm) with significant differences between sites and treatments
(Table 2). Under the Pristine conditions, the distribution in depth showed notorious differences among the
four sites (green circles; Fig. 2). The most contrasting soils were Balducchi and San Alfredo, portraying greater
­NH 4 -OAc-K towards the subsoil and topsoil, respectively. La Blanca and La Hansa sites presented a fairly similar
Pristine ­NH 4 -OAc-K pattern, following a sinuous trajectory with minimum levels at 20–40 cm, and rather comparable values at shallower and deeper layers. Interestingly, observed differences among soils were not reflected
in the average ­NH 4 -OAc-K stocks (0–100 cm), that were rather equivalent (1359, 1055, 1228, and 1284 g ­m [−2] for
Balducchi, San Alfredo, La Blanca and La Hansa, respectively).
A remarkable effect of agriculture was reflected in a considerable decrease in the ­NH 4 -OAc-K levels for the
Control and NPS relative to their Pristine condition (Table 2; Fig. 2) although its vertical distribution varied
depending on the location (Fig. 2). At all locations, significant interactions between treatment and soil depth
were documented (Supplementary material 1, Appendix A). Balducchi and La Blanca (Hapludolls), showed the
higher ­NH 4 -OAc-K depletion rates (averaging 63 and 37%; respectively), which was exacerbated towards the
subsoil (60–100 cm). Contrastingly, in San Alfredo and La Hansa (Argiudolls), ­NH 4 -OAc-K reductions due to
agriculture were lower (average 25 and 27%, respectively) and occurred mainly towards the topsoil (Table 2).
Differences in ­NH 4 -OAc-K between the Control and NPS showed a lower magnitude than relative for the difference of those treatments to the Pristine due to differences in time-spans (Cropping history, Table 1).


**NaBPh** **4** **‑K.** Similarly to ­NH 4 -OAc-K, the slowly-exchangeable fraction ­(NaBPh 4 -K) was found predominantly in the subsoil (20–100 cm) (range 78–81%), without large differences between sites or treatments
(Table 2). The ­NaBPh 4 -K contents were 2.1 times in average (range 1.2×–6.2×) larger than the ­NH 4 -OAc-K.
Treatment by soil depth interaction was significant (p < 0.05) at Balducchi and La Blanca, while main effects
of treatment (p = 0.05) and soil depth (p < 0.05) were significant at La Hansa, and only soil depth resulted in a
marginally significant effect (p = 0.11) at San Alfredo (Fig. 3) (Supplementary material 1, Appendix A). Balducchi showed the larger impact of agriculture on their ­NaBPh 4 -K levels (average 41% depletion as compared to the
Pristine scenario), whereas the other sites varied in a rather small range (5–17%).


**Soil K depletion drivers.** The ­NH 4 -OAc-K depletion patterns followed a close association with the Pristine- ­NH 4 -OAc-K and clay content of each soil layer (Fig. 4). For the Pristine- ­NH 4 -OAc-K, the greater the native
K values, the larger was the documented depletion K rate. On the other hand, increases in soil clay (%) levels
were associated with lower depletion ­NH 4 -OAc-K rate until reaching a threshold about 33% of clay, remaining
at a minimum level for ­NH 4 -OAc-K depletion with high clay content. Conversely, for ­NaBPh 4 -K depletion, the
most relevant factor resulted the silt content (%), showing a depletion trend until reaching a threshold of 50%
of silt, above of which the ­NaBPh 4 -K depletion becomes minimum. A relatively weak but positive association
to Pristine-NaBPh 4 -K content was also observed, however; it resulted less relevant than for the ­NH 4 -OAc-K
depletion.

**Discussion**
Agricultural activities without K replenishment led to substantial negative K budgets that were not translated
into consistent changes in the topsoil ­NH 4 -OAc-K fraction (Fig. 1). These results support our first hypothesis,
which stated that ­NH 4 -OAc-K is not highly sensitive at identifying K depletion in these high native K soils. In
fact, after nine years of cropping with negative K budgets, only two out of the four sites showed changes in this
topsoil K fraction. These two locations (Balducchi and La Hansa) are both characterized by presenting the longest continuous cropping-history, which may have led to greater reductions not only in terms of measured soil K
fractions but also related to total soil K. Unfortunately, no historical yield data was available to further explore
hypotheses related to the effect of cropping history. Nonetheless, these results would indicate that continuous

**Figure 2.** Soil profiles of ­NH 4 -OAc-K (g ­m [−2] ) under three different conditions: pristine soils (green circles),
under grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with no fertilizers added (Control, orange triangles), and under
grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with N, P, plus S fertilization (NPS, purple diamonds). Overlapping error
bars indicate absence of significant differences between scenarios by soil depths combinations (Tukey’s HSD,
_p_ < 0.05).


K removal after nine years of farming has come from extra K-pools (e.g., non-exchangeable-K, root K uplift)
rather than the ­NH 4 -OAc-K at top-soil.
In line with recent surveys performed in the Pampean ­Region [21], our four soils remained high in K fertility
along the experimental period, as reflected by topsoil ­NH 4 -OAc-K values above the critical level. Considering an
average annual K removal of 62 kg K ­ha [−1] (average yields for the studied crop rotation), a soil should lose about
15 mg ­kg [−1] of soil K a year. If all the K budget is reflected on the NH4-OAc-K at topsoil, the critical range could
be reached in between 6 (Balducchi) to 224 years (La Blanca). Nonetheless, observed variability is in line with
Simonsson et al. [23], who reported that, besides the K budget, the soil K depletion results from the interaction of
multiple factors such as cropping history, soil texture and mineralogy and potential subsoil K supply. Additionally, our data reveals that the subsoil ­NH 4 OAc-K levels are decreasing but still high.
Regarding our second hypothesis, we found evidence to support that K depletion occurs mainly beyond the
topsoil. Both soil exchangeable and slowly-exchangeable K vertical distribution patterns displayed large depletion
relative to the Pristine scenario in the whole soil profile (0–100 cm). However, depletion of both fractions was
more pronounced at subsoil (20–100 cm) (55–83% for ­NH 4 -OAc-K and 74–95% for ­NaBPh 4 -K) rather than in
the usually tested 0–20 cm soil layer. It is known that plants can remobilize K from the subsoil towards shallow
­layers [16][,][24][,][25], and this effect would be exacerbated under minimum or no-tillage management where the stover
may release significant amounts of soluble K that later has low mobility into the soil ­matrix [19][,][26] . Thus, our results
highlight the relevance of subsoil on the K supply for ­crops [27] and thus, of building awareness about soil K profile
­concentrations [28] . For practical reasons, most of soil K recommendation systems are based on topsoil data without
considering the subsoil—e.g _._ 0–15 cm in the US Corn Belt, where also Mollisols is the dominant soil ­order [29] .
However, our results are consistent with a K recommendation system based on the combined ­NH 4 -OAc information from both the topsoil and the subsoil such as former system in ­Iowa [29] and recommendations in ­India [30] .
Lastly, obtained results fully support our third hypothesis, since the two main factors affecting K depletion
rates were the pristine K levels and the soil texture (reflected as clay and silt content). In the same long-term
experiment, Sucunza et al. [31] reported a similar tendency for phosphorus: the higher the pristine nutrient levels
the higher the nutrient depletion rates. In terms of soil texture, its influence on ­NH 4 -OAc-K critical levels is well
­documented [9][,][32][,][33], as well as soil K buffer capacity is affected by clay content and ­mineralogy [34][–][37] . Particularly in

Pampean soils, with _loess_ as the main parental material, the silt fraction also contributes to the cation exchange
capacity with clay minerals rich in K such as ­illite [38], supporting our finding of reduced ­NaBPh 4 -K depletion with
increased silt content. Thus, an increased soil K buffer capacity could mask the effects of continuous K removal.
In other soils, negative K budgets were reflected not only in ­NH 4 -OAc-K but also in changes in more stable and
recalcitrant soil K ­fractions [9][,][11][,][24][,][37][,][39] . Finally, our results also indicate that the root K uplift process was accentuated at locations without fine-textured horizons (Balducchi and La Blanca). Thus, soil layers with greater clay
content involve not only a high buffer capacity but may also denote a mechanical impedance to root ­growth [40],

.
ultimately affecting K uptake and ­removal [41]
This research offers an indication that topsoil ­NH 4 -OAc-K interacts with subsoil K and other soil K pools as
a K source for satisfying plant nutrient demand. Yet, it is worth acknowledging the need of more comprehensive
studies on soil-K depletion trends in response to different crop management practices for the Pampean Mollisols.


**Conclusions**
The high indigenous-K fertility of Pampean Mollisols is progressively being depleted due to the prolonged and
intensive agricultural use without K replenishment, thereby rendering them to express responsiveness to K in a
near future. Continuous K removal by crop harvest without K replenishment led to soil K depletion primarily
concentrated in the subsoil. In such sense, the single use of topsoil ­NH 4 -OAc-K in high native K soils could result
in an incomplete assessment of soil K fertility diagnosis. Instead, both topsoil and subsoil K analyses could be
complemented to develop more precise guidelines on medium-to-long-term K fertilizer needs. Also, as soil K
depletion increased with indigenous K level and decreased with finer soil texture, including them as key metadata
will contribute for an improved development of soil K guidelines.


**Methods**
**Experimental sites.** The Pampas region is located in the East-Central region of Argentina. The climate is
temperate and annual mean temperature varies from 15 to 25 °C. The rainfall pattern is humid to the East and
semiarid to the West. Mollisols, Entisols, and Alfisols are the predominant soil orders in the ­Region [42] . Agricultural activities are mainly concentrated in the Mollisols. The main crops are maize and soybean during the

spring–summer and wheat during the winter-spring seasons. Maize and wheat are usually fertilized with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) but at rates below nutrient removal, resulting in negative ­budgets [43] .
In 2000, a long-term fertilization network was established at farms from the southern Santa Fe region of
_Consorcios Rurales de Experimentación Agrícola_ (CREA), located in the Central Pampas of ­Argentina [31][,][44][,][45] . Four
sites from the network, differing in soil properties and management history, were selected for this study (Table 1).
Two sites were under maize–double-cropped wheat/soybean (M-W/S) rotation—Balducchi (34° 9′ 26.0″ S, 61°
36′ 33.8″ W) and San Alfredo (33° 53′ 14.1″ S, 61° 27′ 30.5″ W), and two sites were under maize-full-season
soybean-double-cropped wheat/soybean (M-S-W/S) rotation-La Blanca (33° 29′ 57.2″ S, 62° 37′ 55.3″ W) and
La Hansa (32° 23′ 04.2″ S, 61° 11′ 58.8″ W).


**Design and measurements.** The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with three
replicates. Plot size was 25–30 m wide and 65–70 m long. Two contrasting fertilizer treatments were evaluated:
(1) control, without fertilization, (2) the recommended nutrient management, including the three most deficient
nutrients in the region—N, P, and S (NPS). Additionally, adjacent soils to experimental plots with no antecedents
of agriculture were evaluated as pristine soil conditions (Pristine). For the NPS treatment, N and S were applied
at rates based on crop demand, ranged from 90 to 175 kg N ­year [−1] and from 17 to 25 kg S ­year [−1], P rates were
decided each season before planting according to the attainable yield and P removal, averaging 37 kg P ­year [−1] .
Nitrogen fertilizer was not added to soybean. All nutrients were applied before or at planting using solid fertilizer blends. The source of N was urea (46% N), for P was mono-ammonium phosphate (23% P), and for S was
calcium sulfate (19% S).
For all treatments, crop residues were not removed or grazed and negligible K losses from leaching and/or
runoff were assumed. Annual budgets were estimated from crop grain yield and grain K concentrations data.
No differences in grain K content between Control and NPS treatments were observed during the first years
(2000–2002), and no grain-K measurements were made for the 2003–2009 period. For grain crops, provided
crops evidence of K sufficiency, seed K contents are highly conserved that other management practices impacting
yields are often inconsequential for grain K ­concentration [46][–][49] . Therefore, average values (2000–2002) of 4.0, 5.7
and 19.0 g K ­kg [−1] grain for maize, wheat and soybean, respectively, were assumed to be constant for K removal
calculations. Those values are in range with previously published data for ­maize [2], ­wheat [3], and ­soybean [4][,][50] .
Soil samples were collected at early spring in 2000, 2004 (0–20 cm) and 2009 (0–100 cm, see below) for all
treatments. Soil properties related to total organic C, soil-test ­P [51], soil ­pH [52] (1:2.5 soil:water), bulk ­density [53], and
secondary ­elements [54][,][55] were determined at the onset of the trial (2000). Soil extractable-K was determined by
the pH 7 buffered 1.0 M ammonium-acetate method ­(NH 4 -OAc-K) [56] . Soil texture was measured also at the onset
of the trial at topsoil (0–20 cm) and the rest of the soil layers (20–100 cm) were obtained from the Soil Survey

Summary of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria,
INTA).
In 2009, three sub-samples of soil profiles per plot were sampled and fresh mixed at five depths (0–20, 20–40,
40–60, 60–80, and 80–100 cm), dried at 40 °C until constant weight, and sieved (2 mm). Soil extractable-K was
determined as ­NH 4 -OAc-K [50], and by the modified sodium tetraphenyl boron method ­(NaBPh 4 -K) [9] . The vertical distribution of both ­NH 4 -OAc-K and ­NaBPh 4 -K was expressed on a volumetric basis (g ­m [−2] ) as in Jobbagy
and ­Jackson [16] . Bulk density, determined for Control and NPS plots at the onset of the study for each soil layer
(Table 1), was used to transform from gravimetric (mg ­kg [−1] ) to volumetric units (g ­m [−2] ).


**Statistical analysis.** For testing the first hypothesis, variables of interest were the topsoil ­NH 4 OAc-K
(0–20 cm) for 2000, 2004 and 2009 years and the apparent cumulative K budget (kg ­ha [−1] ) of both the Control and NPS treatments. For the apparent cumulative K budget, treatment with two levels (Control and NPS),
and the crop number with 12 (La Blanca, La Hansa) and 13 (Balducchi and San Alfredo) levels (2000–2008)
and their interactions were considered the fixed factors while the block was considered as random. For topsoil
­NH 4 OAc-K, treatment with two levels (Control and NPS), year with three levels (2000, 2004 and 2009) and their
interactions were considered as fixed, while block was considered as random. In both cases, a mixed effect model
with repeated measures over time was applied using the _nlme_ ­package [56] of the R ­software [57] . Additionally, the
relationship between the ­NH 4 -OAc-K with the apparent cumulative K budgets (2000, 2004 and 2009) was tested
with a simple linear regression model by pooling data from all four locations.
For the second hypothesis, ­NH 4 -OAc-K and ­NaBPh 4 -K contents (g ­m [−2] ) were considered to evaluate the
agricultural footprint (Pristine, Control and NPS in 2009). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was partitioned
by location. For vertical distributions of ­NH 4 -OAc-K and ­NaBPh 4 -K, we applied a mixed effect models with
repeated measures over space (soil depth) using the _nlme_ ­package [56] . Thereby, treatment, soil depth and their
interactions were considered as fixed factors, while block was considered as random factor. The fulfillment of
the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance for the K budget, ­NH 4 -OAc-K and ­NaBPh 4 -K were
visually (QQ-plots and Student’s residuals vs. fitted values) and formally evaluated (Shapiro-Wilks normality test).
Finally, we selected the best models based on the lowest scores for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Means
and significant interactions were obtained using the LSMEAN/PDIFF procedure using the _emmeans_ ­package [58] .
For the third hypothesis, regression analyses were executed to estimate the effect of soil texture (clay, silt
and sand -%-) and pristine K richness (Pristine ­NH 4 -OAc-K and ­NaBPh 4 -K) on the depletion of ­NH 4 -OAc-K
and ­NaBPh 4 -K. A stepwise selection was applied using the _stepAIC_ function from the MASS ­package [59] to define
the most relevant variables linearly associated with both depletions. Once variables were selected, partial linear
and linear-plateau relationships were further tested for interpretation purposes using the _stats_ package v3.6.2 [57] .
