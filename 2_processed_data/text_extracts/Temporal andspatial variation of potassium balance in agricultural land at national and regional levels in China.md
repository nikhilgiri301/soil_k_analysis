## Abstract


Linking potassium (K) balance to soil fertility creates a valuable indicator for sustainability

assessment in agricultural land-use systems. It is crucial for the efficient use of K resources,

food security and resource sustainability to realize soil K balance status in China. Therefore,

temporal and spatial changes of K balance for farmland in China from 1980 to 2015 were

analyzed at national and regional levels using statistical data and related parameters. At the

national scale, K input increased from 6.78 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 23.44 Mt K 2 O in 2015 with an

average annual increment of 0.48 Mt K 2 O, and output changed from 8.10 Mt in 1980 to

21.31 Mt in 2015 with an average annual increment of 0.38 Mt K 2 O as well. On average, K
balance was -24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,

respectively. Moreover, the average balance of six regions was considerably different which
were -21.37, 1.25, 13.70, -22.79, 99.22 and 7.18 kg K 2 O ha [-1] from 1980 to 2015. The potas
sium use efficiency (KUE) decreased with time which were 127.09, 104.35, 87.69 and

89.69% in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively, and the decline of slope could also

reflect the variation tendency of KUE. Great variation of K balance across different regions

demonstrated that fertilizer application and management practices need to be adjusted to

local conditions.


**Introduction**


Low soil fertility is one of the main constraints of agricultural productivity, so enhancing soil
fertility is the basis for guaranteeing food security [1, 2]. The recommended means of improving soil fertility is by regulating farmland nutrient cycles and balance through rational fertilization [3]. Balanced fertilizer application can not only save resources, but also improve
economic benefits. Nutrient balances (also known as nutrient budgets) are calculated by the
difference between nutrient inputs and outputs of a system with predefined spatiotemporal
boundaries [4]. Thus, they are generally expressed as an amount of nutrient per unit of area

and time (e.g., kg ha [-1] yr [-1] ). Negative nutrient balances indicate that a system is losing nutrients,
however in some cases, nutrients apparently accumulate (and might lead to nutrient losses if
strongly in excess). Nutrient balances have been used extensively for improving natural resource
management and/or for recommendations over the last decades [5–9]; they are useful tools as
indicators of potential land degradation and for optimizing nutrient use in agricultural systems
to maintain sustainability of soil nutrient resources and agricultural production [10, 11]. Therefore, maintaining the balance between plant nutrient inputs and outputs in agroecosystems has
become very important for sustainable development and soil quality [12, 13].
To provide enough food for the continuously growing population in China, large quantities
of fertilizers, mainly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers, have been used in agriculture

[3, 14]. However, potassium (K), an essential element for crops, has often been neglected [15].
Potassium deficiency is a global problem [16] and there have been huge changes in soil K all
over the world, from Europe [17, 18] to Africa [19, 20] to Asia [21, 22], and North America

[23]. China suffered a serious soil K deficiency from 1961 to 1997 [24]. Liu et al. [25] indicated
that soil K had been a limiting factor for sustainable agricultural production especially in some
parts of northeast and north-central China. In recent years, soil K deficiency has been relieved
with the increase in fertilizer K application and straw return. Shen et al. [13] indicated that
although the soil K balance was deficient in the period from 1993 to 2001, the situation was
improved from 1999 to 2001. Several studies also showed that significant soil K surpluses were
observed in vegetable production in Hebei [26], Shandong [27] and Jiangsu provinces [3].
Previous studies about K balance have mainly focused on specific experimental sites [15,
28–31] or short-term observations at national level [32], but it is difficult to show in-depth
analysis of element balances based on specific experimental sites or one-year studies [3].
Although a negative K balance might not occur in the short term, long-term negative K balance is still a potential problem [33]. Because nutrient balances can vary considerably from
year to year, short-term studies providing limited information might be misleading [24]; Sheldrick et al. [24] also emphasized the importance of using nutrient balances at the national level
which would help to develop national fertilizer policies including decisions on investments in
fertilizer factories and the exploitation of local resources and minerals to supply nutrients.
Information on temporal variability of K balances in agroecosystems at the national level
could be of great benefit for policymakers and farmers in finding strategies and measures for
reasonable use of K resources to ensure food security [13], as described in previous studies [24,
34–36].
The objective of this study was to evaluate the temporal and spatial variation in K balances
and K use efficiency in China from 1980 to 2015. The results will help to identify regions with
poor soil fertility and assist in putting forward strategies by rational nutrient management to
improve low-yielding field.


**Materials and methods**


Study area


Based on 31 provincial data sets, gross soil K balance was calculated in mainland China excluding Hong Kong and Macao. China is divided into six regions according to geographical locations and China’s administrative divisions, as shown in S1 Table [32, 37].


Data sources


The data used in this paper, such as chemical fertilizer, livestock numbers, crop yield, population number living in the countryside, planting area and cultivated land area, were obtained
from the China Agriculture Statistical Report [38].



[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 2 / 17


Temporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China


In this study, data pre-processing primarily included original data verification. The former
steps included filling in the missing data, data validation and derivative data construction.
After that, a reasonable database was built, which included provincial K balance data from
1980 to 2015. For the sake of analysis, we compared the K balance across four decades: 1980s
(1980–1989), 1990s (1990–1999), 2000s (2000–2009) and 2010s (2010–2015).
Because of the enormous amount of data in the original database, it was difficult to identify
the flawed data. Therefore, a strict rule was applied for those indicators: the data from adjacent
years could not vary by more than 15%. The missing data could be filled in either by referring
to a statistical yearbook/published literature or by using the data from adjacent years. However, some indicators that did not exist in the original database needed to be acquired from
other indicators. For example, the amount of straw is a required indicator, but it can only be
calculated by multiplying grain crop production by a literature survey-based conversion factor
(the ratio of grain to straw), which is distinguishing for different crops. The parameters needed
in this model for K balance calculations in Chinese farmland were explained in Liu et al. [39];
spatial variation of parameters was estimated by region.


Soil K balance model description


The soil K balance model included the following inputs: chemical fertilizer, organic manure,
atmospheric dry and wet deposition, irrigation and crop seeds (K 2 O, similarly hereinafter)

[39]. In detail, the organic fertilizer resources were categorized by human and animal manure,
straw and cake manure. The following outputs were used: crops removal (including grain and
straw uptake) and nutrient loss (leaching and runoff loss).
**Chemical fertilizer inputs.** The ratio for K 2 O in compound fertilizer was different in different regions and years, as shown in S1 Table [32, 37].
**Organic manure inputs.** The organic manure resources mainly include human and livestock manure, straw return and cake manure. The human and livestock manure including the
parameters of livestock feeding period, daily excretion, K 2 O content and application rates to
field were listed in Table 1 [39–41]. The quantity of crop straw was calculated through grain
yields and the ratio of grain to straw for each type of crops and the K contents in straw were
collected from published studies (Table 2) [42]. The rates of straw return to fields in the 2000s
and 2010s were published in Li and Jin [32] with 15% in NE and NW, 60% in NC and 30% in
the MLYR, SE and SW. In the 1980s and 1990s, the crop straw was removed from fields and
returned back into the soil with burned ashes to different extents. The straw return rates in the

1980s were about 1/3 of those in the 2000s, (5% in NE and NW, 20% in NC and 10% in the
MLYR, SE and SW). In the 1990s, the straw return rate was 2/3 of those in the 2000s, (10% in
NE and NW, 40% in NC and 20% in the MLYR, SE and SW). The cake production rate of different crops and the K content in cake manure were collected from published data (S2 Table) [39].
**Other inputs.** In addition to chemical fertilizer and organic manure, atmospheric dry
and wet deposition, irrigation and crop seeds were analyzed as sources of farmland nutrients
(S3 Table).
**Arable crop outputs.** The amount of arable crop outputs was the principal nutrient output in the agricultural system which was calculated through economic yield and K requirement
for unit of economic yield of different crops (Table 3) [32, 39]. The arable crop outputs were
categorized into five kinds of crops, including cereal crops, fruit and vegetables (fruit, vegetable
and melons), oil crops (oil crops and beans), industrial crops (sugar beet, sugar cane, fiber
crops, cotton and tobacco) and root crops (sweet potato and potato).
**Leaching and runoff outputs.** Few reports have been published quantifying accurate
amounts of K 2 O leaching and runoff outputs. This type of output only accounted for a small

**Results**


Temporal and spatial variation in K inputs


**Temporal variation in K input in China.** At the national scale, the average K input from
1980 to 2015 was 14.95 Mt K 2 O (146.92 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ). The K input showed an increasing
trend with an average annual increment of 0.48 Mt K 2 O (3.94 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ) from 6.78 Mt
K 2 O in 1980 to 23.44 Mt K 2 O in 2015 with the coefficient of determination (R [2] ) of 0.990 (Fig
1A). At the national level, the K inputs all increased considerably with time; the K inputs were
8.03 Mt K 2 O (84.25 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ), 13.41 Mt K 2 O (139.35 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ), 18.78 Mt K 2 O
(183.32 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ) and 22.66 Mt K 2 O (203.33 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ) in the 1980s, 1990s,
2000s and 2010s, respectively.

The K input mainly consisted of three components: chemical fertilizer, organic manure and
other K input resources (atmospheric deposition, irrigation and seeds), which accounted for
32.8% (4.91 Mt K 2 O), 59.2% (8.85 Mt K 2 O) and 8.0% (1.19 Mt K 2 O) of the total input from
1980 to 2015, respectively. The K input of chemical fertilizer increased dramatically over time
with an average annual increment of 0.29 Mt K 2 O from 0.38 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 10.58 Mt K 2 O
in 2015. Additionally, the K input of human and livestock manure and straw return increased
substantially from 1980 to 2015 with average annual increments of 0.11 and 0.07 Mt K 2 O,
respectively (Fig 1B). In the past four decades, the K input from chemical fertilizer became a
larger contributor accounting for 10.2, 27.0, 38.2 and 44.5% of total K input, respectively. The
K input from human and livestock manure accounted for a substantial proportion of the total
K input, but it showed a decreasing trend which was 65.9, 50.9, 42.2 and 36.7% in the 1980s,
1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. At the same time, the ratio of straw return increased over
time, which was 9.0, 12.8, 12.4 and 12.4% in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively.
However, the K input from irrigation, atmospheric deposition, cake manure and seeds was
small and decreased over time (Fig 2).
**Temporal and spatial variation in K input in six regions.** The K input in six regions all
increased over time, despite two fluctuations in 1995 and 2005 (Fig 3A). At the regional level,
the K input in SE was the highest and increased rapidly from 111.65 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to
477.56 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015, followed by the NC, MLYR and SW which increased from 58.24,
77.01 and 117.10 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to 228.15, 273.67 and 293.86 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015, respectively. The K input in the NE and NW increased slowly and steadily from 37.34 and 65.67 kg
K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to 90.91 and 134.06 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015, respectively.
The significant variation in K input at the regional level can be easily observed (positive values in Fig 4). The K input in SE was significantly larger than that in other regions. The K input
in SW was significantly larger than that in the NE, NC and NW, but it was not significantly different from that in MLYR. Besides, the K input in the MLYR was significantly larger than
those in NE and NW, but it was not significantly different from that in the NC. In addition,

The K input in the NC was significantly larger than those in NE and NW. There was no significant difference in K input between NE and NW. The K input in all six regions increased
significantly over the past four decades, except for the K input in the NE and NC that was
maintained the same level in the 2000s and 2010s, and the K input in the NW showed no
increase between 1980s and 1990s. The SE had the largest K inputs which were 152.05, 282.60,
405.38 and 464.00 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. Additionally, the
NE and NW had the lowest inputs which were 40.25, 67.09, 84.60, 88.34 and 73.72, 82.30,
98.36, 128.87 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively (Fig 4).

At the regional level, all input flow types with positive values in six regions over the past
four decades were displayed in Fig 4. The K input from chemical fertilizer was more than that
from manure in NE, NC, NW and SW except that in NC in the 2010s, in which the K input
from chemical fertilizer (2.37 Mt K 2 O, 87.55 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ) was more than that from
human and livestock manure (2.11 Mt K 2 O, 78.21 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ). The K input in the 1980s
and 1990s of the MLYR was mainly derived from human and livestock manure, with values of
1.16 Mt K 2 O (56.87 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ) and 1.37 Mt K 2 O (68.45 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ), respectively.
However, the K input in the 2000s and 2010s of the MLYR was primarily chemical fertilizer,
with values of 2.28 Mt K 2 O (113.10 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ) and 2.97 Mt K 2 O (139.56 kg K 2 O ha [-1]

yr [-1] ), respectively. Most of the K input in the SE was from chemical fertilizer except in the
1980s when the K input was chiefly from human and livestock manure (0.64 Mt K 2 O, 90.96 kg
K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ).

K output from 1980 to 2015 was 14.78 Mt K 2 O (146.11 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ). Additionally, the K
output increased substantially over time with an average annual increment of 0.38 Mt K 2 O
(3.01 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] ) from 8.10 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 21.31 Mt K 2 O in 2015 with a determination coefficient (R [2] ) of 0.976 (Fig 1A). At the national level, the K output increased considerably over time with values of 108.41, 145.27, 162.01 and 183.84 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s,
1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively.
The K output mainly consisted of two components: crops removal and loss (leaching and
runoff), which accounted for 99.0% (14.63 Mt K 2 O) and 1.0% (0.15 Mt K 2 O) of total output,
respectively from 1980 to 2015. The K output of cereals crops increased dramatically over time
with an average annual increment of 0.17 Mt K 2 O from 5.95 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 11.95 Mt K 2 O

in 2015. Additionally, the K output of fruit and vegetables and oil crops increased substantially
from 1980 to 2015 with average annual increments of 0.13 and 0.05 Mt K 2 O, respectively (Fig
1C). The K output from crops removal of cereals was the most important part of the output,
accounting for 70.2, 65.3, 55.4 and 55.8% in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. The K
output from crops removal of fruit and vegetables gradually became an important part of the
output accounting for 8.7, 13.0, 21.9 and 24.1% in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. In addition, the crops removal of oil crops (which accounted for 10.4, 12.1, 13.6 and

K output) were relatively steady in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. The crops
removal of root crops and leaching & runoff accounted for a small part of the total K output
and decreased over time (Fig 5).

Temporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China


**Temporal and spatial variation in K output by regions.** Although the output had some
fluctuations, the trend in K output generally increased over time in all regions (Fig 3B). At the
regional level, the K output in the MLYR, SE and SW was high in 2015 and fluctuated suddenly
(increasing from 120.25, 135.02 and 113.35 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to 257.74, 275.28 and 262.60
kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015), followed by the NC (increasing from 74.77 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to
218.70 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015), and then the NE and NW (increasing from 62.78 and 33.65 kg
K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to 102.80 and 125.85 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015). Nevertheless, the K output in the
NE increased slowly with some fluctuations from 1982 to 1989, thereafter stabilizing from
1990 (94.47 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to 2015.
There were significant variations in K output at the regional level (negative values in the Fig
4). The K outputs in MLYR and SE were significantly larger than those in other regions. The K
output in SW was significantly larger than that in NE, NC and NW. In addition, the K output
in NC was significantly larger than that in NE and NW. There was no significant variation in
K output between NE and NW. The K outputs all increased significantly over the past four
decades except for NE which increased from the 1980s to the 1990s, but it didn’t change from
the 1990s to the 2010s. The MLYR and SE had large K outputs which were 164.86, 207.03,
224.70, 248.69 and 153.57, 210.03, 237.98, 266.09 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and
2010s, respectively. Additionally, the NE and NW had the lowest K outputs with values of
70.97, 97.27, 93.85, 99.63 and 47.70, 71.71, 88.56, 124.03 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s
and 2010s, respectively (Fig 4).
The composition of K output at the regional level differed among regions, which was
revealed by the negative values (Fig 4). The main K output source was cereals crops, which
increased over time for all regions except for SE. As for the other output sources, the K output
from fruit & vegetables and oil crops accounted for a larger part for all regions except for SE in
which the larger sources of K the output were fruit & vegetables and industrial crops.


Temporal and spatial variation in K balance


**Temporal variation in K balance in China.** At the national scale, the average K balance
from 1980 to 2015 was 0.81 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] . K was deficient from 1980 (-1.33 Mt K 2 O) to
1997 (-0.10 Mt K 2 O), but this condition was gradually alleviated from 1984 (-3.23 Mt K 2 O) to
1995 (0.67 Mt K 2 O). After that time, the K balance reached a slight surplus and remained relatively stable from 2003 (2.74 Mt K 2 O) to 2015 (2.13 Mt K 2 O) (Fig 1A). On average, K balance
increased by -24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,
respectively.
**Temporal and spatial variation in K balance by regions.** As it was shown in the lie graph
(Fig 3C), the average K balance in six regions from 1980 to 2015 varied widely with values of
-21.37, 1.25, 13.70, -22.79, 99.22 and 7.18 kg K 2 O ha [-1], respectively. The annual K balance
showed different trends in six regions (Fig 3C). The K balance in the SE moved into surplus
from 1985 onwards, while the K balance in NE remained in the negative changing from -25.44
kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to -11.90 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015. Additionally, other four regions all reached
balance by 2002. In detail, the balance in the SE increased from 1980 to 2005 (186.88 kg K 2 O
ha [-1] ) even though the K balance had a short term decrease from 1995 to 1998; after 2005 it
remained relatively stable to 2015 (202.29 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ). In addition, the balance in the NW
was slightly in surplus and remained relatively stable from 1980 (32.02 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to 2015
(8.21 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ). The balance in the NC and SW was negative from 1980 (-16.53 and 3.74 kg
K 2 O ha [-1], respectively) to 1993 (-5.33 and -6.66 kg K 2 O ha [-1], respectively) and in the MLYR
from 1980 (-43.23 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to 2001 (-3.62 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ), after which they were all in surplus
until 2015 (9.45, 31.26 and 15.94 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in NC, SW and MLYR, respectively). To

summarize, the negative stage of K balance could be divided into two stages: firstly a decrease
and then an increase.

The average K balance in SE was the largest and had a distinct increase over time with values of -1.53, 72.58, 167.40 and 197.91 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. However, the K balances in NE and MLYR were significantly lower than those in other
regions with values of -30.72, -30.18, -9.25, -11.29 and -69.41, -37.74, 13.14, 19.91 kg K 2 O ha [-1]

in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively; NE stayed in deficit for the entire period.
The K balances in NE, MLYR, SE and SW all increased significantly with time. Although NW
remained in surplus throughout the study period the values decreased over time with values of
26.02, 10.60, 9.80 and 4.84 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s 2000s and 2010s, respectively. At the
meantime, the K balance in NC increased from the 1980s (-29.08 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to the 2000s
(22.64 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ), and then decreased dramatically between the 2000s and the 2010s (10.72
kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) (Fig 6).
**Temporal and spatial variation of KUE.** Average KUE in China from 1980 to 2015 was
103.60%. During the past four decades, the KUE decreased with values of 127.09, 104.35, 87.69
and 89.69% (Table 4), and the decline in the slope could also reflect the KUE (Fig 7). However,
great variation in KUE existed across different regions with mean values of 138.63, 107.28,
83.02, 121.65, 73.97 and 97.22% for NE, NC, NW, MLYR, SE and SW, respectively (Table 3).

There was a positive linear correlation between K input and K output in crops with the correlation coefficients (R [2] ) of 0.41, 0.70, 0.83 and 0.80 for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,
respectively (Fig 7). The balanced condition could also be found according to the 1:1 line,
which was divided into two parts. Left part of the 1:1 line represented K deficit, which meant
that the K output was larger than the K input. On the contrary, right part of the 1:1 line represented K surplus which meant that the K input was larger than the K output. If the points were
around the line, it meant that the K in some places had reached to a balance stage. Additionally, data points in the 1980s were scattered largely above and below the 1:1 line while more
data points in the 1990s aggregated around the line; more data points were below the line in
the 2000s and 2010s.


**Discussion**


Temporal and spatial variability in the K balance


There was great spatial variation for K input and output which was correlated with the different crops and soil fertility [30, 43]. Results in this study indicated that K input and output
increased dramatically with time. The K input kept increasing as the use of chemical fertilizer
increased year by year, whereas the K output also continued to increase because of the increase
in crop yield and change of K output from different crops. For example, the proportion of K
removal in output for cereals crops (low K uptake) decreased from 70.2% to 55.8%, but it
increased from 8.7% to 24.1% for fruit & vegetables (high K uptake) in the past four decades.
However, the input and output in the NW were lower over the past four decades than those in
other regions because of the low chemical K fertilizer application and low crop yields [43, 44].

Temporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China


On one hand, over-reliance on the imported K fertilizer and the increasing cost limited the use
of K fertilizer [13, 24, 45]. On the other hand, some farmers believed that N and P application
played a more important role in increasing crop yield than K fertilizer [46] because the application of K fertilizer does not produce results as quickly as N and P fertilizer application; this is
because of the high soil K supply capacity with high K-containing minerals such as micas and
feldspars in the soil parent material [47, 48].
Conversely, the K balance increased steadily, which was mainly attributed to improvement
of the social economy and improved management among farmer households [3]. For example,
chemical fertilizer application in the SE increased dramatically with economic development,
leading to a substantial surplus in the K balance. Another important reason for the improved
K balance is that more crop residues were returned back to soils with the development of agricultural mechanization [43]. In addition, K balance in the NE was still deficient which indicated that K input in the NE was insufficient to meet crop production. However, the soil
available K in NE was stable from the 1990s to the 2000s [43], which implied that the abovementioned K input sources were not the only source of K for crop absorption and that soil K
mineralization also played a substantial role. In this study, the K balance in the NW was stable
at the equilibrium state over four decades, but the soil available K decreased from the 1990s to
the 2000s [43]. One of the reasons for this might because K was easily fixed with the alternation
of dry and wet climate conditions [49]; this might result in decreasing K availability because of
the slow mineralization of returned straw [50, 51].


K fertilization predictions and recommendations


The nutrient balance exhibited a strong relationship with nutrient management and sustainable agricultural development [3], so it was necessary to budget the agricultural nutrient balance on a macro level, especially for policy makers who need to be informed on national
situations. The K balance prediction in 2020 was mainly based on the policy of zero growth of
chemical fertilizer and 60% straw and manure return rates. So far, the crop yield in 2015 was
the highest and could be regarded as the optimal level. We assumed that if zero growth of
chemical fertilizer is achieved by 2020 and crop yields is maintained at the optimal level as
those in 2015, the K balance for China will be 76.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] . Large temporal and spatial
variation in the K balance highlighted that fertilizer application and management practices
need to be adjusted based on local conditions. For example, the K surplus in the SE was over
70% in recent years, which demonstrated that the potential for decreasing K fertilizer application in SE was large. Therefore, it is realistic to decrease chemical K fertilization whilst maintaining high and steady yields without increasing cropping areas. Furthermore, reducing the
rate of K fertilizer applied was effective in reducing K surplus and enhancing the KUE [52].
The K fertilizer application could be decreased by 202.29 kg K 2 O ha [-1] to maintain equilibrium
in the K balance. In contrast, it is essential to apply more K fertilizer timely and efficiently in
both NE and NW in order to maintain the soil K balance over the long-term because of the
decline in the K supply capacity. Reports indicated that straw return alone was not sufficient to
maintain the soil K balance although more crop residues were returned back to soils with the
development of agricultural mechanization [47, 53, 54]. Nevertheless, it is necessary to pay
attention to the rational utilization of organic manure, especially cow urine in the field, and
combine it with the same rate of commercial fertilizer in order to alleviate the K deficit [3, 18].

The K balance in the SE showed a short-term decrease from 1995 to 1998 because of the reduc
tion in the number of cattle, which indicated that cow urine contributed substantially to the K
balance. Certainly, nutrient management recommendations must change with yield levels and
profit maximization in crop production systems [55].

Temporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China


KUE


Potassium use efficiency (KUE) is the uptake efficiency defined as the percentage of K input
that is recovered as K output in crops [3, 12, 34]. The KUE in China decreased with time
because of increasing K application rate which suggested that the effect of K fertilizer on
increasing grain production had diminished [55, 56]. From the distribution of data in Fig 7,
the soil K balance in the 1990s in China was the most reasonable period during the past four
decades, which was in accordance with the K balance results (-24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50
K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively). Nevertheless, the K balances went
into surplus in several provinces in the 2000s and 2010s, which indicated that K fertilization
has deserved more attention with time. However, great spatial variability in KUE existed
with values of 138.63, 107.28, 83.02, 121.65, 73.97 and 97.22% in the 2010s for NE, NC, NW,
MLYR, SE and SW, respectively. The KUE in SE was the lowest because of the overuse of K
fertilizer.


**Conclusions**


It is necessary to budget the soil K nutrient balance on the national level, especially for policy
makers. The tendency toward N and P surplus and K deficit has been addressed and corrected,
but large spatial variation in the K balance in this study highlighted that fertilizer application
and management practices need to be adjusted depending on local conditions. Well-managed
fertilizer use can create a “win-win” situation by increasing food production and reducing soil
degradation in nutrient-poor, fragile soils. Increased K fertilizer application has led to a reduction in fertilizer use efficiency in China. There is an urgent need for the government to act
decisively on this issue. The effect of K balance on crop yields under different soil fertility
should be verified in different soil types in further studies, to continue the application and
extension of these results. Therefore, K fertilizer management needs to consider the soil K balance so as to build up a soil K pool to guarantee both high yield and high efficiency of K fertilizer. It is hoped that these results will provide a basis for rational K nutrient management in
the Chinese agricultural system.
