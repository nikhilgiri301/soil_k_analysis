# **Principles of Potash use**


## **Needs of the plant**

Normal plant growth requires large quantities of potassium (K, often referred to as potash, K 2 O). In fact,
throughout growth most crops contain more potassium than any other nutrient including nitrogen (N).
Small quantities of potassium are needed to support many of the crucial enzyme processes within the
plant but very much larger amounts are used to control the water relationships in the plant. Potassium
also plays a vital role in the transport of sugars and other products of photosynthesis from leaves to
storage organs. Adequate quantities of potassium are thus essential for a crop to achieve its full yield
potential and also for many aspects of product quality such as grain size and appearance, tuber size,
oil content, dry matter and starch content, percentage sugar and fruit ripening and quality.


Many of the functions of potash in the plant are related to physiological conditions and stress. These
functions are diverse and include efficient nitrogen and water use, drought tolerance, frost resistance and
resistance to pests and diseases. It is therefore not surprising that lack of plant-available potash in the
soil results in weaker, less vigorous crops that suffer major penalties in difficult growing seasons. In years
when growing conditions and yields are good the response to potash may be modest, especially for crops
like cereals, but in adverse years its contribution to optimum yields will be substantial. Adequate
potassium thus provides some 'insurance' against adverse conditions in difficult growing seasons.

## **'Potash' and 'potassium'**


Fertilisers and organic manures release potassium into soil solution as the potassium ion, K [+ ] and plants
take up potassium in this same form. However the potassium content of fertilisers is usually referred to
and measured as 'potash' or K 2 O. This is just a convention and 'potassium', 'potash', 'K' and 'K 2 O' are
often used interchangeably when referring to fertilisers or application rates. Soil analysis results are given
as mg/litre (or ppm) of K (potassium) which relates to an Index, not to an amount of fertiliser, and should
not be confused. If it is necessary to convert K 2 O to K (for example if converting the UK recommendations
in this leaflet for use in the Irish Republic) the K 2 O value should be multiplied by 0.83. Similarly K
values can be converted to K 2 O by dividing by 0.83.


## **The N and K partnership**

Potassium and nitrogen are strongly associated in
plant processes and should be considered together.



Fig 1: **K effect on N response**



Firstly in terms of uptake, both nutrients are needed
in large amounts at the same time. N is mainly taken
up as the negatively charged nitrate anion NO 3 [- ] and
potassium as the positively charged cation K [+] . When
equal amounts of both are taken up together, the
neutrality of the system is maintained. Nitrogen
application and uptake stimulates the growth of
plant cells which take in water. Potassium is required
to maintain the turgor (rigidity) and regulate the
water content of the cell. Maintenance of cell turgor
is essential to optimise the interception of solar
radiation (sunlight) to provide energy for the conversion of carbon dioxide to sugars, the basic building
block for the production of harvestable yield.

Within the plant the complex formation of protein from nitrate and its distribution around the plant are
highly dependent upon adequate K supply. If 'normal optimum' rates of N are applied in the absence of
sufficient K, full response to nitrogen will not be obtained and residues of nitrogen may remain and be
leached at the end of the season (see Figure 1).


Typical patterns of K uptake for cereals and roots are shown in Figures 2 and 3. For combinable crops,
uptake will peak at around flowering, whereas for root crops maximum uptake is shortly before harvest
or at haulm destruction.


In most plant species the total content of potassium is larger than that of any other nutrient, even
nitrogen. For optimum growth the plant-available supply of potassium in the soil must meet both the
maximum total demand and the required rate of daily uptake. This will vary from season to season
depending on soil conditions and weather. Whenever there is a rapid surge in growth the soil supply must
be able to meet the demand of the crop. Hence the need to maintain soil reserves is a sound insurance.
Typical peak rates of uptake are 5-10 kg K 2 O/ha/day for root crops and oilseed rape.

## **Sources of potash**

Fig 4: **The K cycle**


Plant roots take-up potassium as the cation K [+] from the soil solution and it is this, plus the 'readily
available K', which is measured by soil analysis as being potentially available to the crop (Figure 4). Small
quantities can be taken in from a foliar application but the amounts are usually insignificant in relation
to overall potassium needs. (It is also a costly method.) Rainfall contributes very small amounts of
potassium (less than 5 kg/ha/year). Fertilisers, manures and crop residues all add potassium to the soil as
K [+] . Almost all potassium sources are soluble* and increase the concentration of K in the soil solution

for the K to be released, perhaps over 12 months.



Only small amounts of K are maintained in
the soil solution 5-20 kg/ha K (6-24 kg K 2 O).
The majority of potassium reserves in the soil
are held by the negative charges on clay
minerals and organic matter (Figure 5). The
potassium may be held weakly or strongly
according to the position in the clay lattice.
K [+] which is loosely held ('exchangeable K') is
rapidly released for plant uptake, whilst
the more firmly bonded reserve ('nonexchangeable K') is released more slowly.
Individual soils have different capacities to
hold potassium according to clay type and
content and amount of soil organic matter.
Sand soils have very limited reserves of
exchangeable K.





The clay minerals themselves contain potassium as an integral part of their structure (mineral K)
and this is released only over very long time periods by the breakdown of the minerals (weathering).
In UK conditions the amount of K released by weathering of the clay minerals is too small to meet the
needs of even average crops. The different pools of soil K shown in Figure 4 are defined in relation
to the plant availability of the K and are not distinct. The amount of K in each pool varies with
potash additions, crop uptake, N use, soil wetting and drying, cultivations, etc.


_except specific clay mineral fertilisers used in organic farming - see PDA Leaflet 23_ .

## **Potash leaching**

Potassium does not leach anything like as readily from soils as does nitrate and sulphate. Potash
additions not taken up by the crop will be held in the soil by the clay minerals or organic matter as
described above. For the great majority of soils, which have a clay content of 5% or more, where
normal rates of potash are applied, potassium not used by the crop will remain in the cultivated layer of
soil and will not move further down the profile. However, significant losses of potassium can occur when
any source of potash (fertiliser, slurry or manure) is applied under adverse conditions i.e. when soil is
water-logged, frozen or very dry and deeply cracked. Most of this loss is by surface run-off and can be
avoided by following codes of good agricultural practice. Soils with less than 5% clay (the sands and
loamy sands) have a much lower retentive capacity for potassium. Such soils, especially if shallow and
subjected to rainfall producing large amounts of through-drainage, have a greater risk of potassium loss.
On these soils, potash should be applied 'little and often' and applications timed to suit crop uptake and
amounts carefully matched to crop offtake.

## **Soil analysis**


Many decades of detailed research work have resulted in the present soil analysis system as the best
practical approach for assessing the adequacy or deficiency of soil potassium supply (see PDA Leaflet 24).
Soil analysis measures the K in the soil solution and exchangeable K to give a guide to the amount of
potassium that is available to the crop. All soils contain much larger total quantities of K as shown in
Figure 4. Slowly available reserves (non-exchangeable K) may contribute to plant supply over the course
of a season but this release is variable and impractical to measure. For many soils the slowly available
reserve provides only a minor annual supply but it can be more important on some very clayey soils
(see PDA Leaflet 19).

## **Soil K and crop response**


Fig 6: **Response of winter wheat & spring barley to soil K** Fig 7: **Response of potatoes & field beans to soil K**


The yield response curve to soil potassium supply follows the same principles as for other inputs. At very
low levels of available soil K, the response to applied potash is large and the response decreases to nil as
soil supply increases. Target levels for soil K which represent the level at which K supply is adequate for
full yield but not excessive have been established from large numbers of response experiments for
different crops.


5


As shown by the scatter of points in Figures 6 and 7 for a number of field experiments, the response to
soil K can vary. Often variation is due to factors other than the availability of soil K. For this reason the K
Index system, as in RB 209, gives a range of soil K values for each Index and is intended to provide a
general guide to interpretation.


**soil K mg/l**


**Index 0** 0-60 Large responses likely
**Index 1** 61-120 Smaller responses probable
**Index 2** 121 - 240 Responses unlikely
**Index 3** 241 - 400 Nil response from grass & most arable crops
**Index 4** 400 - 600 Unnecessarily high levels of reserve for arable crops & grass

## **Principles of manuring**


_It is the soil that feeds the crop, while fertilisers feed the soil._


**Critical values of soil K for different crops have been established from numerous experiments**
**as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 at which full crop yield will be achieved. For all soils, except the**
**lightest textured soils which cannot sustain these levels without risk of leaching, the aim is to**
**maintain soil K above the critical level appropriate to the rotation, using fertiliser and manure**
**to replace the potassium removed by cropping.**


It should be recognised, therefore, that potash is unlike most other farm inputs, which are justified on
the basis of direct yield response and financial return per £ spent. Correct use of potash to replace
crop offtake and maintain soil reserves may not result in an immediate yield response. Failure to replace
the potassium removed in the crop and maintain an adequate soil reserve prejudices future yields and
crop quality and unnecessarily jeopardises the response to all other inputs.


Policy for the lightest textured soils (sands and loamy sands) should be to ensure at least the replacement
of removals but not to expect to be able to raise the inherently low levels of soil K to the same values as
for other soils.

## **Benefits of maintaining soil fertility**


- Fertile soils have a better distribution of nutrients throughout the soil profile, and this cannot be
achieved immediately from fresh fertiliser applications. This results in more effective uptake,
especially for poorer rooting crops such as potatoes, and better yields than can be achieved from low
soil fertility and high fertiliser regimes.


- Soils with adequate nutrient levels avoid the risk of damage to roots from local, high concentrations
of salts from large fertiliser applications.


- Satisfactory fertility removes the urgency of timeliness in application of fertilisers, which eases peak
work-loads, offers cash flow benefits and allows fertiliser application to be undertaken at the best
time without risk to soil structure or seedbeds from tractor wheelings. Crop response to nitrogen
fertiliser depends on having appropriate amounts of other nutrients (e.g. P, K, S, and Mg) in the soil
profile explored by roots. Shortages of these nutrients will result in poorer responses to nitrogen and
the risk of leaving unused nitrogen residues in soil.

## **Target levels of soil fertility**







 - _Soil target concentrations are for Olsen P. Some laboratories use other extractants._


** _These soils cannot be maintained at higher levels of K without risking unacceptable_


_losses. Regular use of organic manure is of considerable benefit in these situations._


Soil K levels cannot be rapidly changed up and down to suit individual crops and the appropriate target
level must be set for the most demanding crop in the rotation.

## **Low fertility soils**



The rate at which reserves in a low K soil should be
built up is largely an economic decision.
Consideration should be given to the likely loss of
crop yield and quality of all the crops grown in the
rotation on a low K soil, as well as the cost of
fertiliser. Soils vary in their capacity to retain
potassium (buffering capacity) and require different
quantities of potash to increase plant-available K as
measured by exchangeable K.





**Approximate amounts of potash needed**
**to increase exchangeable soil K by 60 mg/l**
**(e.g., lower Index 1 to Index 2-)**



The quantities required may seem surprisingly large Clay 800
but are a consequence of the fact that some of the
added K goes into non-exchangeable reserves that
are not measured by soil analysis. In practice, low soil K levels should be improved over a period of years
using annual remedial amounts (see for example RB 209). Heavier soils are less likely to be found with
low K levels but will take longer to restore to a satisfactory level than lighter soils.

## **Fertiliser policy**

Following the principles of manuring stated earlier, fertiliser recommendations comprise two
components:

**Replacement of nutrient removed = R**

Calculated from standard offtake x yield/ha - see page 9.


**Soil fertility adjustment**


Additions to improve low soil K, or reductions to allow unnecessarily high levels to decline.
These can be made annually to each crop or periodically in larger applications depending upon
soil type and rotation and financial considerations.


These two components vary with soil K Index as shown in the table below. Fine-tuning of the soil
fertility adjustment could be done where soil is in the upper or lower parts of Indices 1 or 3.
For example, at low Index 1, the fertility adjustment could be +125 kg K 2 O/ha for vegetables or
+35 kg K 2 O/ha for arable and grassland.

## **Removal of potash**

Under-estimation of K offtake is one of the commonest causes for soil K levels to fall below target and
emphasises the need to undertake careful estimations of the amount removed. Standard figures to
calculate removal and therefore **replacement** needs are given below:





_*_ _offtake value is per tonne of grain or seed but includes nutrients in grain and straw._


9


## **Fine tuning**

Where more site-specific information is available it may be possible to 'fine tune' the general offtake
guidance in this leaflet. For example in the case of sugar beet, recent studies indicate that the tare-house
analysis of root K content (x 1.2 to convert to K 2 O), used in conjunction with yield provides an accurate
indication of potash offtake, see PDA Leaflet 12.


**A number of other specific aspects may be considered.**


**Soil structure**


Compaction, soil pans or other adverse structural problems can inhibit root growth and thus their ability
to take up nutrients from a large volume of soil. 'Fertility' embraces other factors as well as nutrients,
including soil aeration and water availability and organic matter content. Improvement of these factors
leads to better biological activity in the soil and more readily available nutrients. These aspects should be
a starting point not an after-thought in fertility management.


**Soil depth**


Soil analysis measures the available nutrients to sampling depth - normally 15 cm for arable soils and
7.5 cm for permanent grassland - and in soil particles less than 2 mm in diameter. The amount of soil
in this size range that can be explored by roots is important. Thus soil depth and stoniness can affect
nutrient availability, and should be taken into account when interpreting soil analysis results and
assessing the amount of nutrient available. Whilst nutrients are generally most concentrated in the
plough layer, it is clear that modern high-yielding, well-rooted crops derive considerable amounts of
potash from greater depth. It may be valuable to estimate the likely supply of K by analysing samples
taken at depth for soil N. However, interpreting the results may not be easy because there is little
information on the amount and distribution of roots at depth.


**pH**


A larger proportion of applied potash tends to become non-exchangeable on neutral and calcareous soils
than on soils with pH around 6. Additions of fertiliser to improve low K status will have less impact on
such soils and this needs to be considered when calculating fertiliser requirements for these soils.


**High magnesium soils**


Potassium availability may be affected on soils with very high Mg levels. It has been suggested that where
the concentration (mg/l) of soil Mg is more than twice that of soil K, potash availability to the crop may
be less than implied by the actual potassium analysis value. In such circumstances no more magnesium
in any form should be applied to the rotation and higher applications of K may be used to overcome the
imbalance. The application of calcium to replace the magnesium is not recommended, principally
because it will also displace K.


**Non-exchangeable K**


There is still no practical method to estimate the supply of slowly released K, which will vary
greatly between soils and between seasons. For some heavy soils it may be sufficient to provide all
the needs of combinable crop rotations and permit applications for root rotations to be halved.
However, this does not apply to all clay soils - see PDA Leaflet 19. On lighter soils, allowance for
non-exchangeable K should only be made where objective information or experience is available.


10


## **Organic manures**

Inadequate allowance is still frequently made for the nutrient contribution from manures. Use standard
figures unless specific analysis is available for consistent materials, and deduct the total amount of potash
in manure applied if the soil Index is 2 or more. For soils at Index is 0 or 1, K added in manures can be
thought of as helping to increase soil reserves and normal applications of fertiliser K should be given.

A difficult financial situation should not persuade farmers to reduce levels of potash below the guidelines in this leaflet. Whilst the soil K targets are not precise cut-off points, it must be recognised that the
risk of yield and quality penalties generally increases with lower soil K levels. In view of the fact that
potash is not lost from most soils and that it is the least expensive of all major nutrients, such risks do
not seem worthwhile.


The estimation of potash offtake and the replacement of this quantity remains the most important
aspect of fertiliser policy for K.
