(2019): Balance of potassium in two long-term field experiments\nwith different fertilization treatments. Plant Soil Environ, 65: 225\u2013232.\n\n\n**Abstract** : Balance of potassium (K) was observed in long-term stationary field experiments (21 years) at two sites with\ndifferent soil and climatic conditions (Luvisol, Cambisol). The following crops were rotated within the trial: potatoeswinter wheat-spring barley. All three crops were grown each year. The trial comprised 6 treatments: (1) no fertilization;\n(2) farmyard manure; (3) half dose of farmyard manure + nitrogen (N) in mineral nitrogen fertilizers; (4) mineral\nnitrogen fertilizers; (5) NPK in mineral fertilizers; (6) straw of spring barley + N in mineral nitrogen fertilizers. The\nrecovery rate of potassium from farmyard manure by crops was 24\u201326%, from mineral fertilizers it was 27\u201352%.\nDifferent fertilization intensities were manifested by significant differences in the content of exchangeable K in soil.\nChanges in non-exchangeable K (K ne ) were recorded only at the Luvisol site (850 mg K ne /kg), but not at the Cam\u00ad\nbisol site (3000 mg K ne /kg). The maximum negative balance (\u20132376 kg K/ha/21 years) was recorded at the mineral\nnitrogen fertilization treatment.\n\n\n**Keywords** : farmyard manure; mineral fertilizers; potatoes; wheat, barley; bioavailable K; non-exchangeable K\n\n\n\nThe total potassium (K) content in soils is in the\nrange 0.01% to 4% and usually oscillates around\nca 1%. To determine the optimum content of bio\u00ad\navailable K in soil, various methods may be used.\nIn past, it was especially the Egner-Riehm method\n(Egn\u00e9r et al. 1960). In the Czech Republic, the official\nmethod for agricultural soils analyses nowadays is\nthe Mehlich 3 method (Mehlich 1984, Madaras and\nLipavsk\u00fd 2009, Schroder et al. 2009, Kulh\u00e1nek et\nal. 2014, Madaras and Koubov\u00e1 2015). Binner et al.\n(2017) used the CaCl 2 /DTPA (CAT) extraction to\ndetermine the optimum content of bioavailable K in\nsoil; yet, this method is suitable mostly for garden\nsubstrates analyses. To determine exchangeable po\u00ad\ntassium (K ex ), 1 mol/L ammonium acetate solution\nwas used (Blake et al. 1999, Liu et al. 2010, Madaras\net al. 2014). However, plants do not uptake only po\u00ad\ntassium from the soil solution and exchangeable K.\nThey are able to absorb also some part of the non\n\n\nexchangeable K (K ne ) (Hinsinger and Jaillard 1993).\nIn the plant rhizosphere, a zone poor in K is formed.\nAs a consequence, plants excrete H [+] to the rhizos\u00ad\nphere (Steingrobe and Claasen 2000), which results\nin release of non-exchangeable K. To determine\nnon-exchangeable K, boiling 1 mol/L HNO 3 ex\u00ad\ntraction is often used followed by subtracting of\nNH OAc-determined K from the obtained values\n4 (ex)\n(Srinivasarao et al. 2014, Das et al. 2018, Kitagawa\net al. 2018). As reported by Liu and Bates (1990),\nthe content of non-exchangeable K provides good\ninformation about the amount of plant-available K.\nA significant positive correlation with fixed am\u00ad\nmonium ion strongly supports the hypothesis that\nnon-exchangeable K is bound mainly at boundaries\nof the clay minerals of the 2:1 types, mica and ver\u00ad\nmiculite (Brouder 2011). The fact that a significant\ncorrelation was not determined between the content\n\nof non-exchangeable K and clay particles supports\n\n\n\nSupported by the European Regional Development Fund \u2013 Project NutRisk Centre, Project No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_\n\n019/0000845.\n\n\n**225**\n\n\n_Original Paper_ _Plant, Soil and Environment, 65, 2019 (5): 225\u2013232_\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.17221/109/2019-PSE\n\n\n\nthe hypothesis that the clay mineral type is more\nimportant than the total content of clay particles\n(Kitagawa et al. 2018). The authors further suggest\ndetermining not only exchangeable K but also nonexchangeable K, which enables a complex view of\nthe potassium issue, especially at insufficient K fer\u00ad\ntilization (risk management) and resulting K deficit\nin agricultural soils.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the potassium\nbalance and related changes in soils at different ferti\u00ad\nlization treatments. Long-term field experiments were\ncarried out at two different sites. The crop rotation used\nin the experiment corresponds well with the intensive\nfarming systems used in the Czech Republic (CR).\nThis research is also important from the viewpoint\nof the long-term sustainable soil management in CR,\nwith respect to the fact that annual potassium doses\nin mineral fertilizers for more than 20 years have been\nonly 5\u20136 kg K/ha agricultural soil.\n\n\n**MATERIAL AND METHODS**\n\n\nThe trials were established in 1996 at two sites\n\nwith different soil-climatic conditions: Hn\u011bv\u010deves\n\nand Humpolec (Table 1). Within the trials, three\ncrops were rotated in the following order: potatoes,\nwinter wheat, spring barley. Each year all of the crops\nwere grown. The trial comprised 6 treatments: (1) no\nfertilization (control); (2) farmyard manure (FYM 1);\n(3) half dose of farmyard manure + nitrogen (N) in\nmineral nitrogen fertilizers (FYM 1/2); (4) mineral\nnitrogen fertilizers (N); (5) NPK in mineral fertiliz\u00ad\ners (NPK); (6) straw of spring barley + N in mineral\nnitrogen fertilizers (N + ST) (\u010cern\u00fd et al. 2010).\nOrganic fertilizers \u2013 farmyard manure and straw (ST)\nwere always applied in autumn (October) to potatoes.\nMineral phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were\napplied to each crop in autumn; mineral nitrogen\nfertilizers were applied to potatoes and spring barley\nin spring prior to the crop establishment. In the case\nof winter wheat, the nitrogen dose was divided into\nhalves, the first one was applied at BBCH 21, the\nsecond one at BBCH 31\u201332. The application rate\nof mineral nitrogen was 140 kg N/ha for wheat and\n70 kg N/ha for spring barley; at FYM 1/2 treatment,\nN was applied at the rate of 115 kg N/ha for wheat\nand 50 kg N/ha for barley. The NPK treatment of\nwinter wheat and spring barley included phosphorus\nat a rate of 30 kg P/ha (triple super phosphate) and\npotassium at a rate of 100 kg K/ha (60% potassium\nsalt). At the other treatments, the dosage of phospho\u00ad\n\n\n**226**\n\n\n\nrus (P) and K depended on the content of nutrients\nin the applied organic fertilizers (Table 2).\n\nSoil analyses were always proceeded with air-dried\nsoil samples (\u2264 2 mm; 0\u201330 cm depth; four replica\u00ad\ntions). For the purposes of this manuscript, soil\nsamples taken up in the year 1996 were analysed in\ndetail (autumn, before experiment establishing) and\nat the end of 7 [th] crop rotation, shortly after plant\nharvest in 2017. The data evaluated here are based\n\nonly on the results of the soils taken up from the\nplots with spring barley.\n\nAll plants were harvested after reaching the maturity\nstage every year of the experiment to get the yield\ndata. Samples of barley and wheat grain and straw as\nwell as potato tubers were dried at 40\u00b0C and subse\u00ad\nquently proceeded with dry decomposition (Mader et\nal. 1998). The potassium content was measured due\nto the atomic adsorption spectrometry (AA280FS,\nAgilent Technologies, Mulgrave, Australia).\n\nCaCl 2 /DTPA (CAT) extraction (CSN EN 13651, 2001).\nFor this procedure, 3.00 g of soil sample was weighed\ninto 50 mL tubes. To all samples was applied 30 mL\nsolution of 0.01 mol/L CaCl and 0.01 mol/L 0.002\n2\ndiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). The solu\u00ad\ntion was shaken for 1 h on a horizontal shaker. Extracts\nwere filtered and measured on the optical emission\nspectrometer with inductive coupled plasma (ICPOES, Agilent Technologies 700, Victoria, Australia).\n\n\nTable 1.

The amount of\n3.00 g of soil sample was extracted with 30 mL solu\u00ad\ntion of 0.02 mol/L CH 3 COOH, 0.25 mol/L NH 4 NO 3,\n0.015 mol/L NH 4 F, 0.013 mol/L HNO 3, 0.001 mol/L\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The solu\u00ad\ntion was shaken for 5 min on a horizontal shaker and\n\nsubsequently filtered. Potassium content in extracts\nwas measured by the ICP-OES.\n\nAmmonium acetate extraction (hereinafter NH 4 OAc)\nwas realized due to modified procedure by Haby et\nal. (1990). Soil samples (3.00 g) were extracted with\n30 mL 1 mol/L ammonium acetate solution at pH 7.00.\nThe soil solution slurry was shaken for 2 h, and the\nsolution was separated from the solid by centrifuga\u00ad\ntion. The addition of excess NH 4+ to the soil displaces\n\nthe rapid exchangeable potassium from the exchange\nsites of the soil particles. The concentrations of K were\nsubsequently analysed by the ICP-OES.\n\n\n\nBoiling HNO 3 extraction (Helmke and Sparks 2000)\nwas following: 2.5 g of finely ground soil sample was\nheated with 25 mL of 1 mol/L HNO 3 in an Erlenmeyer\nflask on a hot plate for 10 min after boiling started.\nAfter cooling for 5 min, the sample was filtrated and\nthe extract was diluted to 100 mL with 0.1 mol/L\n\nHNO .

At the Hn\u011bv\u010deves\nsite, higher yields of cereals were recorded (grain:\nwheat \u2013 7.07 t dry matter/ha; barley \u2013 4.54 t dry\nmatter/ha) compared to the Humpolec site (grain:\nwheat \u2013 6.29 t dry matter/ha, barley \u2013 3.83 t dry\nmatter/ha). Higher yields of potatoes were recorded\nat the Humpolec site (7.82 t dry matter/ha) than at\nthe Hn\u011bv\u010deves site (7.40 t dry matter/ha). The con\u00ad\ntents of potassium in wheat grain (0.46\u20130.48% K)\nand barley (0.37\u20130.38% K) were identical at both sites.\nSignificantly greater differences were obtained in\nthe K content in straw: (Hn\u011bv\u010deves: wheat 0.88% K,\nbarley 0.98% K; Humpolec: wheat 1.03% K, barley\n1.18% K); and differences were recorded for K content\nin potato tubers (Hn\u011bv\u010deves: 1.84% K, Humpolec:\n2.15% K). Even though the contents of bioavailable\npotassium in soil at the Humpolec site were lower,\nreported K uptake by plants was higher \u2013 by 348 kg\nK/ha on average for all variants and the period of\n21 years. This difference was probably caused by\nhigher potato yield and also by higher precipitation\n\n\n\nand its regular distribution throughout the vegeta\u00ad\ntion period, which might have a positive influence\non the K uptake. Table 3 shows the positive balance\n(inputs minus outputs) only at the variant fertilized\nwith manure. The highest negative balance (\u20132376 kg\nK/ha) was obtained at fertilization with mineral ni\u00ad\ntrogen at the Humpolec site. Negative balance was\ncalculated also for the NPK fertilization, with average\napplication dose of 90 kg K/ha/year. Neither regular\nstraw incorporation influenced the K balance. The\nutilization of K from manure at the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site\n\nwas 26%, at the Humpolec site it was 24%. In case\nof the NPK fertilization it was 52% (Hn\u011bv\u010deves) and\n27% (Humpolec). There is a clear tendency to higher\nK utilization at soils with higher sorption capac\u00ad\nity, which complies with the results of Blake et al.\n(1999). Higher K utilization at mineral fertilization\nmay be caused by lower dose of K applied compared\nto manure treatments. At lower application doses,\ntheir utilisation is generally better.

These authors explain this as a result\nof K not strongly sorbed in manure.\n\n**Content of bioavailable K** . Results obtained using\nthe Mehlich 3 extraction agent are given in Figure 1.\nAt both sites, statistically significant differences were\nrecorded among individual variants, in compliance\nwith the K fertilization intensity. At the Hn\u011bv\u010deves\nsite, the average value of all treatments reached 200 mg\nK/kg, i.e. by 31% more compared to the Humpolec\nsite \u2013 157 mg K/kg. As to the official assessment\nof K pool in the plough layer in the CR for loamy\nsoils, it is ranked in the category \u2018satisfactory pool\u2019\nor \u2018good pool\u2019 \u2013 based on the variant (Smatanov\u00e1\nand Su\u0161il 2018). It may be presumed that even in\nthe control variant the yields were not influenced\nby the lack of N.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, manure application resulted\nin a significant increase of the exchangeable K con\u00ad\ntent. Liu et al. (2010) reported similar results in the\nlong-term experiments. Significantly lowest contents\n\n\n\nwere obtained at variants without K fertilization.\n\nComparison of both sites shows significantly higher\ncontent (by 34.6%) at the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site (with average\nvalues of 206 mg K/kg) than in Humpolec (153 mg\nK/kg). If the values are recalculated to the level of satu\u00ad\nration of the sorption complex with potassium, this\nparameter almost does not differ for the two sites \u2013\nit is 4.56% in Hn\u011bv\u010deves and 4.37% in Humpolec\n(Table 4); it is given by the differences between the\ntotal values of the cation exchangeable capacity\n(Hn\u011bv\u010deves: 116 mmol + /kg, Humpolec: 90 mmol + /kg).\nThe content > 3.50% cation exchange capacity (CEC) is\nconsidered as satisfactory for these soils. Comparison\nof the K values at both extraction agents (Mehlich 3/\nNH 4 OAc) shows certain similarity. For the Hn\u011bv\u010deves\nlocation, the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient be\u00ad\n\ntween the K contents determined with Mehlich 3 and\n\nNH 4 OAc was 0.989 at the significance level _P_ < 0.001;\nfor the Humpolec location it was 0.958. The relation\u00ad\nship between K in ammonium acetate and Mehlich\n3 is: _y_ = 0.974 _x_ + 7.6145, _R_ [2] = 0.9772 (Hn\u011bv\u010deves),\n_y_ = 0.9505 _x_ + 5.6757, _R_ [2] = 0.9815 (Humpolec). It is\nthus probable that mainly exchangeable potassium\nis released at the Mehlich 3 extraction. High agree\u00ad\nment of these methods is, to a certain extent, given\nby the fact that the study evaluates corresponding\nlong-term field trials. At ordinary agricultural soils,\nthe agreement would probably be lower.\n\nCAT extraction revealed significantly lower K con\u00ad\ntent compared to other extraction methods (Figure 3).\nThe average content for all variants was 110 mg K/kg\nat the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site and 120 mg K/kg at the\nHumpolec site. It is interesting that the ratio of the\nvalues (Hn\u011bv\u010deves/Humpolec) is opposite compared\nto the Mehlich 3 and NH 4 OAc methods, which is\nprobably caused by different character of clay parti\u00ad\n\n\n\nHn\u011bv\u010deves Humpolec\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n166\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n180\n\n\n160\n\n\n140\n\n\n120\n\n\n100\n\n\n80\n\n\n60\n\n\n40\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n180\n\n\n160\n\n\n140\n\n\n120\n\n\n100\n\n\n80\n\n\n60\n\n\n40\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCont FYM 1 FYM 1/2 N NPK N + St\n\n\n\nCont FYM 1 FYM 1/2 N NPK N + St\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

(2017) stated that\n\nthis method was sensitive at variants with added\n\nclay sorbents of the smectite type.\n\n**Content of non-exchangeable K** . Contents of\nnon-exchangeable potassium are shown in Figure 4.\nBoth sites significantly differ; contents were in the\nrange of 816 to 927 mg K/kg at the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site\nin contrast to the interval 2908\u20133068 mg K/kg at the\nHumpolec site. There is a significant influence of the\nsoil-forming materials. Parent material of Cambisol\n(Humpolec) is paragneiss; in the process of material\nchanges (weathering) potassium is released in signifi\u00ad\ncant amounts. On the contrary, Luvisol (Hn\u011bv\u010deves)\non loess has markedly lower potential to release\nK. Blake et al. (1999) observed the changes in the\ncontent of non-exchangeable K at long-term field\ntrials sites. The highest contents were reported for\nBad Lauchstadt: 1810\u20132196 mg K/ha, whereas lower\ncontents were reported for Rothamsted: 650\u20131442 mg\nK/ha. This corresponds with the range recorded at the\nHn\u011bv\u010deves site. High contents approaching 3000 mg\nK/kg were published by \u00d8gaard and Krogstad (2005)\nfor selected soils in Norway. Figure 4 shows that\ncompletely different fertilization for the period of\n21 years did not have a significant impact on the\nchanges of non-exchangeable K at the Humpolec site,\nnot even at variants unfertilized with K in the long\nterm. At comparison of K amount obtained at harvest\n(1663\u20132376 kg K/ha) and the content of non-ex\u00ad\nchangeable K in the plough layer (ca 12 500\u201312 800 kg\nK/ha) it is clear that the effect of fertilization on the\nchanges in the non-exchangeable K may not have\nbeen manifested.\n\n\nAt the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site, a significant tendency to\ndecrease the non-exchangeable K content was ob\u00ad\n\n\n**230**\n\n\n\nserved at the variants without K fertilization. The\n\ncontent of non-exchangeable K in the plough layer was\nca 3600\u20133800 kg/ha, which is comparable with the\nK values at harvest (1124\u20132111 kg K/ha). Moreover,\nnon-exchangeable K was also important for replen\u00ad\nishing plant-available K in soil at this site. A decrease\nof the non-exchangeable K in the long-term trials\nat the unfertilized variants compared to the manure\napplication was reported also by Blake et al. (1999)\nand Srinivvasarao et al. (2014). Furthermore, it must\nbe stressed that not all of the non-exchangeable K\nmay be used by plants, as it is released continuously\nduring many years, as was reported by Moritsuka et\nal. (2002). Non-exchangeable K release depends on\nmany factors, such as K concentration in soil solu\u00ad\ntion, concentration of other cations and pH value\n(Wang et al. 2011).\n\nTable 5 summarizes the results of individual tested\n\nmethods related to the boiling HNO 3 extraction. At\nthe Hn\u011bv\u010deves site, the average content of 1069 mg\nK/ha was obtained, whereas at the Humpolec site it\nwas 3167 mg K/kg. The ratio of non-exchangeable\nK at Luvisol (Hn\u011bv\u010deves) was 80.9%, as compared to\n\n\nTable 5.

The values ob\u00ad\ntained using the CAT extraction were only 60\u201365%\ncompared to the previous methods.\n\n**Changes in K in 1996/2017** . The archive samples\nfrom 1996 were analysed (for each parcel individu\u00ad\nally) and the results were compared with the 2017\nanalysis. The differences in the potassium content in\nthe plough layer (kg K/ha) are reported in Table 6.\nK amount in the plough layer decreased in all the un\u00ad\nfertilized variants. The highest decrease is recorded at\nvariant with mineral N fertilization. The comparison\nof negative values in the potassium balance (Table 3)\nand changes in Table 6 shows that the values in Table 6\nare lower compared to the balance only. It can be\nexplained by continuous mobilisation of potassium\nfrom the non-exchangeable bonds and further also by\nnot considering the K content in the subsoil, which is\nalso a significant potassium source for plants.\n\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n\nBinner I., Dultz S., Schellhorn M., Schenk M.K.
