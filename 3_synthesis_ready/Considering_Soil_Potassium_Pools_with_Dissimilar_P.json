Bell et al.\n\n\nheld rather than identification based on particular soil testing procedures. In this\nchapter, we discuss these K pools and their behavior in relation to plant K acquisition\nand soil K dynamics.\n\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\n\nTraditionally, soil potassium (K) has been depicted as occurring in four pools\u2014soil\nsolution K, exchangeable K, interlayer K, and mineral or structural K (Barber 1995).\nVarious publications have estimated the relative sizes of these traditional K pools\n(for example, \u00d6born et al. 2005; Hinsinger 2006) with K in primary minerals\n\n\u2013\n(90 98% of total soil K) the dominant form of soil K. The K most readily available\n\n\u2013 \u2013\nfor plant uptake [exchangeable K (1 2%) and solution K (0.1 0.2%)] represents\nonly a very small fraction of the total soil K, although interlayer K in secondary\n\n\u2013\nminerals can also be a significant proportion (1 10%, depending on mineralogy).\nHowever, this terminology creates some confusion for a number of reasons. In\nparticular, exchange reactions between the solid and the soil solution phases can\nresult in reversible K movement to or from both surface and interlayer positions of\nclay minerals, while interlayer K can be found in both primary minerals (e.g., micas)\nas well as in secondary minerals (e.g., illite). Furthermore, soils with a history of\nrepeated applications of high-K waste materials and/or high rates of band-applied\ncompound fertilizers containing K may also contain neoformed secondary K minerals with poorly understood behavior in terms of K bioavailability.\nThese considerations have led to the development of an alternative framework to\ndepict soil K pools (Fig. 7.1). There are three key characteristics of this conceptual\ndiagram that differ from the traditional four-pool model. The first is the distinction\nbetween micas and feldspars as K-bearing primary minerals, which is based on the\npresence of K in interlayer positions between mineral layers in phyllosilicate minerals (micas and partially weathered micas) or in the three-dimensional structural\nframeworks of tectosilicates (feldspars). The flux from structural K in feldspars and\nmicas to soil solution K is unidirectional. However, the flux from interlayer K to soil\nsolution K can be bidirectional for partially weathered micas. The second characteristic is the identification of a pool of K in neoformed secondary minerals that can\ninclude fertilizer reaction products. The third characteristic is the replacement of the\n\u201cexchangeable\u201d K pool with a pool defined as \u201csurface-adsorbed\u201d K. The \u201csurfaceadsorbed K\u201d concept clearly identifies where the K is located and the mechanism by\nwhich it is held. It avoids ascribing possible locations (surfaces, wedge, and\ninterlayer positions) on the basis of particular soil testing procedures.\nQuantification of K in these different K pools, particularly in relation to K\navailable for plant acquisition in time frames relevant to individual crop or pasture\n[seasons (i.e., K bioavailability, Chap. 4), is challenging. This is due to both the](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n[limitations of current diagnostic soil testing methods (Chap. 8) and the need to](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nconsider crop, season, and soil-specific factors that regulate root dynamics, rhizo[sphere conditions, and soil moisture dynamics (Chap. 4).

The arrows denote fluxes of K in soil\u2013plant systems\n\n\ndiscuss these K pools and their behavior in relation to plant K acquisition and soil K\ndynamics.\n\n\n7.2 Solution Potassium and Potassium Activity\n\n\nSoil solution K is the quantity of K dissolved in the aqueous liquid phase of the soil\n(Soil Science Glossary Terms Committee 2008). Unless mineral soils have been\nrecently fertilized or amended with manure, soil solution K concentrations are\ntypically low (100\u20131000 \u03bcM) because of selective adsorption of K by some clay\nminerals (Hinsinger 2006). Leaching losses of K are usually low, but they may occur\n[when K inputs exceed the sum of K holding capacity and plant uptake (Chap. 3) or](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_3)\nwhere preferential flow of water occurs.\nAs the monovalent cation, K [+] in the soil solution is the form taken up directly by\nplants (Sparks 1987), with concentrations determined by reactions with solid-phase\nforms of soil K and with other cations on the exchange complex and in the soil\nsolution, and by soil moisture content (Sparks and Huang 1985). The small amount\nof K [+] present in the soil solution in all except recently fertilized soils suggests that\nthe rate of K uptake from this pool is likely to be limited as solution K [+] stocks are\n\n\n166 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nrapidly depleted (Barrow 1966). Therefore, factors that control solution K concentration ultimately influence uptake rates. These factors include the rates of K\ndiffusion in the soil solution from surrounding, undepleted soil, and the quantity\nof readily desorbable K on the exchange complex (Evangelou et al. 1994; Barber\n1995). The moderating effects of other major soil solution cations (Ca, Mg, and Na)\non the kinetics of soil solution K replenishment and subsequent uptake of K by plant\nroots have been the subject of extensive research, reviewed by Sparks (1987) and\nEvangelou et al. (1994). This research has shown that the complex interactions\namong soil solution chemistry, rooting density, and the subsequent competition for\nK uptake make extrapolation beyond the specific conditions of individual experiments difficult (Barber 1995). There is, however, a general recognition of the\nimportance of cation exchange capacity (CEC) on both the ability of the soil to\nbuffer soil solution K (sometimes measured as buffer capacity, BC K ) and also on K\nsupply to the root (Barber 1981). As CEC increases, there is less K available for plant\nuptake, even in soils with the same concentrations of exchangeable K (Bell et al.\n2009). These relationships have currently not been well defined.\n\n\n7.3 Surface-Adsorbed Potassium\n\n\nSurface-adsorbed K is the quantity of K associated with negatively charged sites\non: soil organic matter; planar surfaces of phyllosilicate minerals; and surfaces of\niron and aluminum oxides. However, the location of those charge surfaces and the\nspecificity of those sites for K varies greatly. An example of the contrasting sites was\nprovided by Mengel (1985) for a weathered grain of mica (Fig. 7.2). The p-position\nis a site on the planar surfaces of phyllosilicate minerals where hydrated K [+] is\nadsorbed. In these positions, K ions tend to retain a hydration shell, be weakly and\nnonspecifically bound, and be in rapid dynamic equilibrium with soil solution\nK. Exchange reactions in response to altered soil solution concentrations occur\nvery quickly. For example, cation exchange reactions on montmorillonite have\nbeen measured to be complete in less than 10 [\ufffd][1] s (Tang and Sparks 1993), but\nmodelled to be complete much faster, less than 5 \ufffd 10 [\ufffd][10] s (Bourg and Sposito\n2011). As a result, this K pool is considered to be in a form immediately available for\nmovement into the soil solution in response to depletion by plant root uptake (Barber\n1995).\nPlanar surface sorption sites, along with carboxylate and phenolate groups in soil\norganic matter and negatively charged sites on the surfaces of iron and aluminum\noxides, tend to show a greater affinity for divalent cations like Ca [2+] and Mg [2+]\n\n(Hinsinger 2006). This means that application of soil amendments (lime, limestone,\nor dolomite), or even frequent rainfall or irrigation in well-drained soils, can result in\ndisplacement of surface-adsorbed K from the charged surface by other cations and\npossible loss from the rooting zone through leaching. Other sorption sites illustrated\nin Fig. 7.2, the e- and i-positions, show greater affinity for K and a slower interaction\nwith components of the soil solution. These sites are discussed below.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-position\n\n\nexchangeable\ninterlayer ions\n\n\nmica core\n\n\nvermiculite\n\n\n\np-positions\n\n\nFig. 7.2 Diagrammatic representation of K adsorption positions for mica, a frayed edge of mica,\nand an outer layer where mica has transformed to vermiculite.

(adapted from Mengel 1985; Mei\net al. 2015; Rich 1968)\n\n\n7.4 Interlayer K in Micas and Partially Weathered Micas\n\n\nInterlayer K is the quantity of K bound between layers of phyllosilicate minerals.\nMicas are phyllosilicate minerals with each mineral layer composed of two tetrahedral sheets bound on either side of one octahedral sheet (2:1 layer silicates,\nFig. 7.3a). Layers carry a net negative charge and are bound together by K [+] ions.\nAway from the edges of the crystal, these K [+] ions do not have a hydration shell.\n\n\n168 M. J.

(adapted from Schulze 1989)\n\n\nThey are dehydrated and occupy the ditrigonal cavities in the tetrahedral sheets\nabove and below them in adjacent 2:1 layers (Fig. 7.3a). Muscovite and biotite are\ntwo common micas. Pure muscovite is a dioctahedral mica in which two-thirds of the\ncation positions in the octahedral sheet are filled with trivalent Al [3+] . Biotite is a\ntrioctahedral mineral in which all the cation positions in the octahedral sheet are\nfilled with divalent cations such as Fe [2+] and Mg [2+] . The negative layer charge in these\nminerals is derived primarily from isomorphic substitution of Al [3+] for Si [4+] in the\ntetrahedral sheets. The layer charge of both muscovite and biotite is close to 1 mol of\ncharge per 10-oxygen formula unit (Thompson and Ukrainczyk 2002).\nDuring mica weathering, the layer charge of these minerals declines and\ninterlayer K leaves from the edges of the particles (Scott and Smith 1967; Barber\n1995; Hinsinger 2006). As the net negative charge in the layers decreases, not only is\nK released from some interlayer positions near the edge of the particles but the space\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 169\n\n\n\nFig. 7.4 An example\nstructure of a potassium\nfeldspar (orthoclase) and the\ntypes of bonds present.\nArrows indicate the\ndesorption of K [+] cations\nfrom their original positions\nat the outer surface of the\n\ntectosilicate structure,\nindicated by circles with\ndotted lines. (adapted from\nFenter et al. 2000)\n\n\n\nWeaker\n\nionic bonds\n\n\nStronger\ncovalent bonds\n\n\n\nbetween the layers opens at those locations (Fig. 7.2). These changes allow for freer\nmovement of other cations into that portion of the interlayer region and facilitate\nexchange reactions. In general, weathering of micas leads to loss of layer charge and\ntransformation to vermiculite, and then to smectite (Wilson 1999; Thompson and\nUkrainczyk 2002) (Fig. 7.4).\nAs micas weather, interlayer adsorption sites become differentiated (Fig. 7.2).\nThe e-position is an interlayer adsorption site where hydrated K [+] is preferentially\nadsorbed and where K [+] can rapidly diffuse short distances out of the crystal lattice\nand into the soil solution. Potassium in this position is rapidly exchangeable with\nNH 4+, and NH 4+ is also preferentially adsorbed at these sites (Bolt et al. 1963;\nMengel 1985). The i-position is an interlayer adsorption site where dehydrated K [+]\n\nis preferentially adsorbed and where K [+] diffuses more slowly into the soil solution.\nA wedge zone is the interlayer volume at the nexus where two adjacent\nphyllosilicate mineral layers separate farther due to solvation forces. A wedge\nsite is an interlayer adsorption site at the point where two adjacent layers begin\nto separate farther due to solvation forces. Wedge sites on illite are most selective\nfor the dehydrated cesium cation (Cs [+] ) but are also selective for dehydrated K [+] (Lee\net al. 2017).\nHinsinger (2006) noted that while adsorption/desorption of K can occur in the\ne-positions in frayed edges of weathered clay minerals, this process was considerably slower than that at the planar surfaces discussed in Sect. 7.3. Even slower\nrelease can occur with K in the i-positions, because the ionic radius of K [+] and its low\nhydration energy allow it to dehydrate and fit perfectly into cavities created by the\nbasal plane of oxygen ions in the tetrahedral sheets of phyllosilicates. While adsorption/desorption reactions may still occur under particular circumstances, they are\nvery slow.\n\n\n170 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nMengel (1985) differentiated K adsorption positions by their Gapon selectivity\ncoefficients. The Gapon coefficient is a factor that quantifies the selectivity for one\nion over another at adsorption sites. The higher the Gapon coefficient is, the greater\nthe selectivity. Using the selectivity for K [+] over Ca [2+] (Bolt et al. 1963), Mengel\n(1985) reported that the Gapon coefficients differed by an order of magnitude\nbetween adsorption positions. The p-positions had the lowest selectivity for K\n(Gapon coefficients less than 10), the e-positions had an intermediate selectivity\n(Gapon coefficients approximately equal to 100), and the i-positions had the highest\nselectivity for K (Gapon coefficients greater than 1000).\nAs a mica weathers, transformations occur within very short distances.\nInterstratification is the occurrence of both high-charge layers of mica and layers\nwith lower charge in the same mineral domain. In phyllosilicate clays, the highcharge, K-bearing core is typically illite, i.e., a clay mica. Core illite layers are often\n\n                                                   continuous with near-edge layers where weathering has lowered the charge suffi\nciently to be classified as vermiculite. The difference in the structural charge of\ndomain cores and of layers near domain edges is usually ignored in the literature, and\nsuch particles are lumped into the term \u201cillites.\u201d Potassium that is held in the core\ninterlayers (i-positions) is not surface-adsorbed, is not exchangeable with ammonium, and is not likely to be bioavailable to plants unless subjected to the unique\n[conditions of the rhizosphere (Chap. 4). Indeed, K](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4) [+] cations in those positions can be\nextremely stable. In contrast, the lower-charge interlayer positions near domain\nedges, e-positions in Fig. 7.2, may retain K from fertilizer amendments and release\nit back slowly to the soil solution. Because the layer charge there is lower than in\nunweathered mica layers, K [+] ions are held less tightly and are more susceptible to\nsubsequent release. It should be noted that both primary micas and the high-charge\ncore of illite domains will yield a 1.0-nm d\u2013spacing in X-ray diffraction patterns. It is\ndifficult to quantitatively differentiate a primary mica from illite by using routine\nX-ray diffraction procedures.\n\n\n7.5 Interlayer Potassium in Secondary Layer Silicates\n\n\nSecondary layer silicates are phyllosilicate minerals that are weathering products\nof primary minerals. The interlayer compositions of these minerals are variable and\ncan contain a variety of cations and quantities of water. Figure 7.3b shows an\nexample structure that represents two different types of secondary minerals important to K behavior in soils: smectite and vermiculite. A key feature of these minerals\nis the presence of hydrated cations in the interlayer. The presence of water facilitates\nthe diffusion of cations in and out of the interlayer, making cation exchange possible.\nSoil tests that rely on cation exchange to measure K will measure some K from\ninterlayers of these minerals.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 171\n\n\n7.6 Structural Potassium in Feldspar and Feldspathoids\n\n\nStructural K in feldspars is the quantity of K in structures of tectosilicate minerals.\nMaking up nearly 31% of the Earth\u2019s crust, feldspars (specifically, orthoclase and\nmicrocline) and feldspathoids (e.g., leucine) represent the dominant form of structural K in many soils, with the quantities in soil determined by the intensity of\nweathering and also erosional and depositional factors (Sparks 1987; Barber 1995).\nWhile feldspars are commonly present in the silt and sand fractions of younger and\nmoderately weathered soils (Sparks 1987), alkali feldspars have also been found in\nthe clay fractions of moderately weathered soils (Huang and Lee 1969).\nThe K in feldspars occurs throughout the mineral structure (Fig. 7.3). In\nK-feldspars, silicon (Si)-oxygen, and aluminum (Al)-oxygen bonds are stronger,\ncovalent bonds, but K is held in the tectosilicate structure by weaker, ionic bonds\n(Fogler and Lund 1975). When feldspars weather, the K in the outer layer of the\nstructure is released first, causing structural relaxation of the remaining bonds in the\nsurrounding structure (Fenter et al. 2000). The result is an irreversible dissolution of\nthe mineral\u2019s silicate framework during weathering (Sparks 1987; Barber 1995;\nHinsinger 2006). While K feldspars can be present in only small quantities or are\ncompletely absent in some strongly weathered soils (Sparks 1987), the rates of\nweathering and subsequent K release may be slowed by the formation of a\nnoncrystalline Si-Al-O skin on the mineral surface (Rich 1972). Rich (1968) found\nthat the rates of K release from feldspars were typically slower than that from micas,\nalthough Song and Huang (1988) noted that this order may be altered in the presence\nof organic acid anions (oxalate and citrate) that can be exuded by roots of some plant\nspecies into their rhizospheres.\nThere is evidence to suggest that feldspars can contribute significant quantities of\nbioavailable K to plants, with these contributions potentially originating from sandsized fractions rather than clay-sized fractions. Examples include the work of Rehm\nand Sorensen (1985), who conducted a 4-year trial that varied fertilizer application\nrates of K and magnesium (Mg) in a factorial combination on an irrigated Valentine\nloamy fine sand with aeolian sand parent material. Application rates of fertilizer K\nranged from 0\u2013269 kg K ha [\ufffd][1] . Based on the levels of ammonium acetate\nextractable K, Rehm and Sorensen expected maize (Zea mays L.) yield to increase\nwhen fertilized with K; however, no increase was observed over the study period.\nThey attributed the lack of maize response to the added K to the presence of\nbioavailable K in feldspars in the fine sand and very fine sand size fractions. Sautter\n(1964) characterized the Valentine soil as having up to 23% K feldspars in the upper\n28 cm (inferred from Fig. 7.1 in that paper). Sadusky et al. (1987) measured K\nrelease rates from three US Atlantic Coastal Plains soils that had high quantities of\nfeldspars in the sand fractions, ranging from 6.7\u201316.0% in the surface horizons and\n8.2\u201324.0% in the subsurface horizons. Potassium release rates were studied for a\n\nperiod of up to 30 days in the presence of both oxalic acid and a cation exchange\nresin. Because the resin provided a continuous sink for K and kept solution K levels\nlower than did the oxalic acid, approximately two orders of magnitude more K were\n\n\n172 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nreleased with the resin than with oxalic acid. Most of the K was released in the first\n16 days (inferred from Fig. 7.1 in that paper). After 30 days, the total quantities of K\nreleased by the resin ranged from 67\u201392 mg K kg [\ufffd][1] soil in the surface horizon\nsamples.\nThis type of evidence suggests that blanket statements about coarser-textured\nsandy soils providing little bioavailable K to plants can be inaccurate. The observations of Niebes et al. (1993) that a substantial portion of K had been extracted by rape\n(Brassica napus L.) grown in the coarse (silt and sand) fractions of soils from two\nlong-term fertilizer experiments in Europe support this conclusion. Despite the short\nduration of this experiment (8 days of plant growth), they found for the coarse silt\nand sand fractions that 80\u2013100% of the bioavailable K was not originating in the\nammonium-exchangeable pool. The mineralogical composition and the K-supplying\npower of a given particle size fraction must be considered, and future K recommendations need to consider the possible contribution of K feldspars.\n\n\n7.7 Neoformed Potassium Minerals\n\n\nNeoformed K minerals are newly formed minerals created from the reaction of soil\nsolution K with other soil solution ions. Neoformed K minerals do not include\n\nprimary or secondary layer silicate minerals, but are considered to be a possible\nbyproduct of fertilizer use in intensive cropping areas, especially where compound\nfertilizers that include K are applied in bands with high in-band concentrations (e.g.,\nthe result of wideband spacings in sugarcane or row crops). Such minerals are\nprobably rare in soils, but they may form under certain conditions.\nAs an example, we consider the neoformation of potassium taranakite\n(K 3 Al 5 H 6 (PO 4 ) 8 \ufffd 18H 2 O) or its noncrystalline analogs. Du et al. (2006) coapplied\nmonocalcium phosphate with KCl on an acid (pH 4.6) soil. They hypothesized that\nsome of the added K displaced Al [3+] from exchange sites, leading to precipitation\nof K, P, and Al as a noncrystalline analog of potassium taranakite. Formation of\npotassium taranakite was also observed by Lindsay (1962) after adding saturated\nsolutions of monocalcium phosphate or monopotassium phosphate to an acidic\n(pH 4.9) Hartsells fine sandy loam soil. The formation of potassium taranakite\nwith only monocalcium phosphate indicates that to form this precipitate, K may\nnot need to be added but simply needs to be present in solution or in a position\n(probably the p-position) where it can be readily displaced into solution by fertilizer\naddition. Potassium taranakite was present at 15 min and 3 h after fertilizer addition,\nbut not after 3 days. When Lindsay added those same saturated fertilizer solutions to\na basic (pH 8.3) Webster silty clay loam soil, no taranakite formed. Acid conditions\nwhere Fe and Al are present are necessary for potassium taranakite formation.\nHow the formation of taranakite or other neoformed minerals changes K bioavailability during the growing season of plants has not been well researched and is\ncurrently not well known.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 173\n\n\n7.8 Fixation and Release of Interlayer Potassium\n\n\nThe processes by which K is adsorbed or desorbed from interlayer positions of\nweathered micas, vermiculite, and high-charge smectite are referred to as fixation\nand release. In potassium fixation, hydrated K [+] ions move to interlayer positions in\nphyllosilicate minerals, then dehydrate as the mineral layers contract. In this\nposition, the K [+] is unavailable to plants. Potassium release is when mineral layers\nexpand, K [+] ions rehydrate, and move to the soil solution, becoming bioavailable to\nplants. In addition to environmental factors such as pH, redox potential and temperature, fixation and release are governed by the soil solution concentrations of K and\ncompeting cations. The actions of plant root uptake (depletion) or fertilizer application (enrichment) determine the net impact of fixation and release on the dynamics of\ninterlayer K (Schneider et al. 2013). The processes of K interlayer fixation have been\nstudied extensively, due to the focus on exchangeable K as a proxy of the pool of soil\nK that is bioavailable to plants and the apparent inefficient use of applied K fertilizer\nin soils where K fixation occurs (e.g., Kovar and Barber (1990)), but there has been\nless research focus on the release process. Sparks (1987), Barber (1995), \u00d6born et al.\n(2005), Hinsinger (2006), and Z\u00f6rb et al. (2014) provide detailed reviews of much of\n[this work (see also Chap. 4).](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\nIn some ways, K fixation can be conceptualized as the reversal of mica\nweathering (Fig. 7.5). When micas weather, their interlayers expand, and K is\nreleased. Even though layer charge declines, there is an increase in CEC because\nmore surface area is available to exchange with cations in extractant solutions used\nto measure CEC. This greater surface area comes from interlayer positions that have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 7.5 Model of the processes of K fixation and release\n\n\n174 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK input \u2013 K output (kg ha [-1] year [-1] )\n\n\nFig. 7.6 Annual change in exchangeable K (exch. K) in response to annual K budgets in several\nlong-term fertilizer trials in Europe. Potassium inputs are from organic and inorganic K fertilizers,\nand K outputs occur in harvested produce. The general lack of equivalent changes in exchangeable\nK in response to surpluses or deficits in K budgets have been interpreted as evidence of K fixation or\nrelease, respectively. (Hinsinger 2002)\n\n\nbecome available for ion exchange upon interlayer hydration and expansion. When\nK is fixed between the layers of expanded 2:1 layer silicates, the layers contract,\ntrapping dehydrated K [+] ions in ditrigonal voids in adjacent tetrahedral sheets. The\ndehydration and contraction of interlayers prevent ion exchange, and an equivalent\ndecrease in CEC is observed. Fixed K becomes nonexchangeable, or at least not\n\n+\nexchangeable with NH 4 in the 1 M ammonium acetate extractant commonly used to\nmeasure CEC and exchangeable cations. For decades, the fixation process has been\nstudied in laboratory settings (Barshad 1948, 1951, 1954; Jackson 1963;\nReichenbach and Rich 1975; Wear and White 1951), and its effects can be observed\nat the field level in some long-term fertilized treatments, for example, at the\nRothamsted site discussed by Blake et al. (1999) and other sites in Europe (Hinsinger\n2002, Fig. 7.6). At the same time, the unfertilized or negative K balance treatments in\nlong-term studies have demonstrated that there can be significant net release of\nnonexchangeable K in unfertilized plots (Velde and Peck (2002), Fig. 7.6). However, whether K was released from feldspars, from primary or partially weathered\nmicas, or from secondary phyllosilicate minerals, or simply depletion of unsampled\nsubsoil layers (Kuhlmann and Barraclough 1987; Prasad 2009), was rarely\ndetermined.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 175\n\n\nPotassium ions, in addition to those of other monovalent cations such as NH 4+,\nrubidium (Rb [+] ), and Cs [+], are all fixed in a similar manner (Barshad 1954; Meunier\nand Velde 2004; \u0160ucha and \u0160ir\u00e1\u0144ov\u00e1 1991), while ions of monovalent sodium (Na [+] )\nand the divalent cations calcium (Ca [2+] ), magnesium (Mg [2+] ), barium (Ba [2+] ), and\nstrontium (Sr [2+] ) are not fixed to any appreciable extent. This is because monovalent\ncations have relatively weak energies of hydration compared to the divalent cations\nand so they are more likely to shed water molecules from the hydration sphere as\nthey enter the charged space of the interlayer region. Furthermore, because of their\nsize, K [+], NH 4+, Rb +, and Cs + ions can be positioned more stably in the ditrigonal\ncavities in the tetrahedral sheet than can other monovalent ions like Na [+] or lithium\n(Li [+] ) (Reichenbach and Rich 1975). Staunton and Roubaud (1997) reported that the\norder of increasing affinity of monovalent cations for montmorillonite and illite was\ngenerally Na < K < NH 4 < Cs, arguing that the strong retention of Cs may be the\nresult of the more covalent nature of the Cs\u2013clay interaction compared to the\nelectrostatic interactions of the other ions.\n\n\n7.8.1 Contractive and Expansive Forces\n\n\nAt the molecular scale, most K fixation by 2:1 layer silicates can be thought of most\nsimply as the force of lattice contraction exceeding the forces of lattice expansion\nwith K [+] ions in the interlayer space (Fig. 7.7). Contraction is a result of the attraction\nof negatively charged sites on the silicate surface for the positively charged cation.\nExpansion occurs when the layer charge is insufficient to overcome the energies of\nhydration of the cations in the interlayer (Hurst and Jordine 1964; Kittrick 1966;\nKaufhold and Dohrmann 2010). The repulsion of the strong dipoles of the oxygen\nions that are fixed in place on the basal planes of the minerals also contribute to\nrepulsion of the layers from one another.\nClay layers may also collapse when there are no interlayer molecules or ions (i.e.,\nwater, metal hydroxyl complexes, organic cations, and molecules) to prevent the\napproach of adjacent layers close enough for van der Waals forces of attraction to\nexceed the forces of expansion. The strength of van der Waals forces lies in the\nproximity of clay layers to each other, and the proximity is controlled by the\ncoulombic force of attraction of interlayer cations for interlayer surfaces. The greater\nthe attraction, the closer the cation is held to the interlayer surface. The closer the\ncation is held, the closer an adjacent clay layer can approach. The closer adjacent\nclay layers become, the stronger van der Waals attractive forces become. When van\nder Waals attractive forces exceed the forces of expansion, the clay layers will\ncollapse. Hence, cations with high energies of hydration and large hydrated ionic\nradii (e.g., Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] ) are not appreciably fixed because it is difficult to\novercome the distance that these hydrated cations place between clay layers and\nthe energy with which they hold onto their surrounding water molecules (Fig. 7.7).\nThe coulombic force of attraction of interlayer surfaces for interlayer cations is a\nfunction of layer charge, charge location, and bond geometries in the layer silicate\n\n\n176 M.

Bell et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpansion:\nforce of expansion > force of attraction\n\n\nContraction:\nforce of attraction > force of expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 7.7 Conceptual model of how the force of attraction and force of expansion contributes to\ncontraction or expansion of 2:1 phyllosilicate layers. (Kaufhold and Dohrmann 2010)\n\n\ncrystal. Increased layer charge equates with increased attraction between interlayer\ncations and interlayer surfaces. Tetrahedrally derived negative charge is more\neffective than octahedrally derived negative charge at attracting interlayer cations\nas a result of its proximity to the basal layer surface. Similarly, bond geometries,\nparticularly the hydroxyl group orientations in the octahedral sheet that are largely a\nfunction of cationic occupancies in the octahedral sheet, affect the attraction of\ninterlayer cations for interlayer surfaces by controlling how closely interlayer cations\ncan approach negative layer charge sites.\n\n\n7.8.2 Factors Affecting Potassium Fixation and Release\n\n\nSoil mineralogy is the key to understanding K fixation and release because only 2:1\nlayer silicates fix and release K in interlayer positions. Potassium can be fixed by\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 177\n\n\nmica weathering products, i.e., vermiculites and high-charge smectites (Barshad\n1951, 1954, Ranjha et al. 1990, Rich 1968, Martin and Sparks 1985). Some authors\nindicate that K can be fixed by micas per se, but this is not likely. Micas are defined\nby having a high layer charge (near 1 mol of charge per 10-oxygen formula unit).\nOnce the layer charge declines to a point where K can be reversibly or temporarily\n\u201cfixed,\u201d the mineral is no longer considered a true mica, although it has been derived\nfrom mica. These are partially weathered micas that cannot be distinguished from\nprimary micas as previously discussed. Where K-fixing minerals predominate in the\nclay-sized fraction of the soil, K fixation is often related to the clay content of the soil\n(Shaviv et al. 1985). However, K fixation has also been documented in silt-sized and\neven very fine sand-sized vermiculite and hydrobiotite (Harris et al. 1988;\nMurashkina et al. 2007a, b). The effects of soil type and soil horizon on K fixation\noccur primarily because the amounts and types of 2:1 layer silicates vary among soil\ntypes and soil horizons. Particle size distribution and possible artifacts related to\nsample grinding are important for assessing the degree of K fixation because they\naffect the accessibility of interlayer spaces. Smaller particles generally mean easier\naccess to interlayer spaces. In general, however, smaller particles mean more edge\narea per particle and therefore easier access of K to interlayer spaces where it might\nbe fixed.\nThe degree to which 2:1 layer silicates fix K is largely a function of layer charge\nand the distribution of that charge in the octahedral and tetrahedral sheets. Layer\ncharge affects the electrostatic attraction of the layers for K [+] ions (Rich 1968). Other\nfactors being equal, greater layer charge is often correlated with greater potential for\nfixation (Barshad 1954; Bouabid et al. 1991). Murashkina et al. (2007a) speculated\nthat K fixation in some soils dominated by smectite may be due to high-charge\nsmectites that are transitional to vermiculite. Charge location, however, also influences K fixation. Potassium-fixation capacity has been found to be well correlated\nwith isomorphic substitution in tetrahedral sheets, but poorly correlated with isomorphic substitution in octahedral sheets (Bouabid et al. 1991). This is likely\nbecause negative charge originating in the tetrahedral sheet is closer to K [+] ions in\nthe interlayer space (Reid-Soukup and Ulery 2002).\nIn acidic soils, the presence of hydroxy Al interlayers in vermiculite and smectite\nmay affect K fixation (Saha and Inoue 1998). The hydroxy Al interlayers act as\nobstructions between 2:1 layers that restrict the collapse of the interlayer space\naround the K [+] ions. Blockage of the surface results in a decrease in cation exchange\ncapacity and causes K to become more exchangeable and less likely to be fixed. In\naddition, hydroxy interlayers may slow the entry and exit of exchanging cations.\nDue to the impact of layer charge on K fixation, the redox state of structural Fe in\n2:1 layer silicates can also influence K fixation. The chemical reduction of structural\nFe in both smectites and vermiculites has been shown to lead to increases in negative\nlayer charge and K fixation. Furthermore, reduced Fe (i.e., Fe [2+] ) in the tetrahedral\nsheet appears to have a greater impact on K fixation than reduced Fe in the octahedral\nsheet (Chen et al. 1987; Dong et al. 2003; Favre et al. 2006; Florence et al. 2017;\nStucki et al. 1984, 2000). This is likely due to increased coulombic attraction\n\n\n178 M. J.

Conversely, the reduction of structural Fe [3+] in\nexpanded 2:1 layer silicates can lead to interlayer collapse and K fixation (Scott and\nAmonette 1988). Note that the oxidation of structural Fe in micas can either stabilize\nor destabilize interlayer K, depending on both the pH of the environment and on\nwhether oxidation leads to the ejection of the Fe atoms from the octahedral sheet\n(Thompson and Ukrainczyk 2002). When the oxidation of octahedral Fe in biotite,\nfor example, leads to Fe ejection, nearby hydroxyl ions tend to orient toward the\nempty octahedral site, allowing interlayer K ions to nest closer into the ditrigonal\ncavity and subsequently to be held more tenaciously (Barshad and Khishk 1970).\nAlthough redox-driven changes in K fixation and release might explain some\ntemporal fluctuations in soil exchangeable K, more work needs to be done to further\ntest the role of Fe redox processes on K fixation and release.\nRelease of interlayer K is facilitated by the expansion of interlayer spaces when K\nis replaced by cations with larger hydrated radii (e.g., Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] ), as illustrated\nin Fig. 7.2. Adequate soil moisture and low solution K concentrations are prerequisites for the release of interlayer K during the weathering process, with the\nkey role played by solution K concentration, as demonstrated in Fig. 7.8 (Springob\nand Richter 1998; Hinsinger 2002). Key considerations in assessing the potential\ncontribution of released interlayer K for plant uptake are the following: (1) release of\nK potentially bioavailable to plants is limited to the effective diffusion distance\naround roots and root hairs\u2014i.e., the zones of greatest solution K depletion\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 179\n\n\ncorrespond to the rhizosphere, which typically comprises less than about 3% of the\nsoil volume (Hinsinger et al. 2005); and (2) release of K is also favored by a high\nconcentration of H [+] [ions (i.e., low pH). This is explained in greater detail in Chap. 4.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n\n\n7.9 Interpreting \u201cExchangeable Potassium\u201d\n\n\nWhile the strengths and weaknesses of specific soil test procedures are discussed in\n[detail in Chap. 8, the diagnostic tests most commonly associated with the measure-](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nment of surface-adsorbed K is termed \u201cexchangeable K.\u201d Exchangeable K is the K\nextracted from a sample of soil via cation exchange using a solution of a specified\ncomposition under a specific set of conditions. The quantity of exchangeable K\nextracted from a given soil therefore varies according to the extracting solution and\nconditions used. Conditions typically involve displacement of K [+] by NH 4+ ions.\nExchangeable K is generally considered to be bioavailable to plants.\nThe continuum of sorption positions in soil minerals and organic matter is\ntypically distinguished by the affinity for K and the speed of the chemical reactions\nwith simulated soil solutions in soil testing procedures. Accurate quantification of\nthe K in the surface-adsorbed pool can be difficult, especially in soils where there are\nsignificant amounts of weathered mica grains or secondary phyllosilicate minerals.\nIn soils where the charge is predominantly associated with organic matter or\nkaolinite, exchangeable K determinations are a quantification of surface-adsorbed\nK. In such contexts, this measure can be a reliable index of the capacity of the soil to\nsupply bioavailable K to plants over an extended period (Obreza and Rhoads 1988).\n\n+\nA common misconception is that K exchangeable with NH 4 captures only\nsurface-adsorbed K. When soils contain significant amounts of phyllosilicate min\n+\nerals with hydrated interlayers (e.g., smectite or vermiculite), NH 4 will exchange\nnot only with surface-adsorbed K but also with a variable amount of interlayer\nK. The presence of water between individual layers allows cations to diffuse in and\nout of interlayer positions, making cation exchange possible. Ammonium is especially able to replace interlayer K in hydrated layer silicates because its size and\nhydration energy are similar to those of K.\nThe rates of exchange with NH 4+ are variable and difficult to predict, depending\non the minerals involved, the proportions of planar, edge, wedge and interlayer\nadsorption positions, and thus the selectivity of adsorption sites for K (Mengel 1985;\nSparks 1987; Lin 2010; R\u00f6mheld and Kirkby 2010). For example, the rate of K\ndesorption from kaolinite and smectite is usually rapid (Sparks and Jardine 1984),\nwhile from vermiculite and micaceous minerals (i.e., illite) it tends to be much\nslower (Sparks 1987). In these situations, Carey and Metherell (2003), among\nothers, hypothesized that the two-stage extraction of K by tetraphenyl boron could\nbe related to the e-position, including wedge zones (rapid) and i-positions (slow).\nIn most situations, the volume of soil immediately adjacent to roots is small\ncompared to the entire soil volume, so there is unlikely to be a simple, quantitative\nrelationship between K that is exchangeable with ammonium in a soil test procedure\n\n\n180 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nand that acquired by plants during a growing season. However, even in experiments\nin which soil volumes are small and root density is very high, as is typically the case\nin nutrient depletion assays, not all ammonium-exchangeable K is bioavailable to\nplants. Various authors have proposed the concept of a lower accessible limit of the\nexchangeable K pool, below which plants may not be able to extract K (e.g.,\nTabatabai and Hanway 1969; Schneider et al. 2016). Termed the \u201cplant minimal\nexchangeable K\u201d this term could perhaps be more simply described as the \u201cminimal\nplant-accessible K.\u201d The size of this fraction increases with increasing clay and CEC\n(measured at the pH of the soil (Schneider et al. 2016)), suggesting that as clay\ncontent increases the number of K-specific adsorption sites also increases. It may be\nhypothesized that this fraction of the measured exchangeable K could be a useful\npredictor of a \u201cplant minimal solution K concentration\u201d below which plants are\nunable to take up K.\n\n\n7.10 Mineral Transformations\n\n\n7.10.1 Reversible Changes in Interlayer Potassium\n\n\nLong-term K removal in cropping systems can result in accelerated degradation of\nmicas and an increase in secondary phyllosilicate minerals such as vermiculite and\nsmectite (Barr\u00e9 et al. 2008). Conversely, long-term fertilization with K has been\nshown to increase the apparent concentration of mica-like minerals in soils, even\nthough minerals with layer charges high enough to classify as micas were not being\nformed (Scheffer et al. 1960; Ross et al. 1989; Meunier and Velde 2004; Barr\u00e9 et al.\n2008). Ross et al. (1989) reported such observations after only 4 years of high K\nfertilization. Indeed, changes in the proportion of collapsed interlayers in clay\nminerals of rhizosphere soil materials over the course of a single growing season\nhave been reported by Barr\u00e9 et al. (2007b) and by Adamo et al. (2016).\nChanges consistent with these reports have been reported from both cropped and\npasture systems. For example, a 15-year study of alfalfa (Medicago Sativa L.)\ncropping on a loess-derived soil (De-Cheng et al. 2011) showed topsoil exchangeable K decreased due to alfalfa forage uptake and removal, but total K in the topsoil\nincreased, likely due to K uptake and translocation by the alfalfa roots from deep in\nthe soil. A similar phenomenon of enrichment of illite-like clay in temperate region\nsoils has been hypothesized to result from the redistribution of K from deeper soil\nhorizons to the topsoil horizon through root uptake and plant residue deposition\n(Barr\u00e9 et al. 2007a, 2009).\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 181\n\n\n7.10.2 Implications for Building and Depleting Soil Fertility\n\n\nThe fixation and release of K from interlayer positions in phyllosilicate minerals\nrepresent an important buffering system for plant-available reserves of soil K where\nthose minerals occur. Release of K from interlayers can be particularly important\nunder continuous cropping when rates of added K have been inadequate to replace K\nremoved in harvested crop biomass. There is also evidence that fixation of K in these\nminerals stores K when it is added to soils at rates that exceed removal or when it is\n\nredistributed to surface horizons by crop residue deposition, suggesting a degree of\nresilience that can be exploited to manage soil fertility in the longer term.\nThe immediate challenge to the sustainable exploitation of soil K is to develop\nsimple diagnostic indicators of the likely K status of these buffered systems.\nCandidates for this approach would include assays such as those developed by\nCassman et al. (1990) and refined by Murashkina et al. (2007a), in which the extent\nof fixation of added K fertilizer was ascertained. These assays would not only\nprovide information needed to develop an effective K fertilizer application strategy\n[(discussed in Chap. 12), but could also provide an indicator of the extent of K](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_12)\ndepletion of the interlayer buffer system. Such knowledge could allow the K buffer\nsystem to be exploited when K status was moderate or high, but replenished when K\nstatus was low to avoid irreversible degradation of these minerals. Another useful\napproach could be to develop region- or soil-specific predictions of the minimal\nplant-accessible K that are based on an easily determined parameter like clay content\nor CEC.\n\n\n7.11 Short-Term Transformations in the Rhizosphere\n\n\nThe low concentration of K in soil solutions is thought to be an important driver for\nthe release of K through mineral dissolution and interlayer K release. Plant roots play\na key role in depleting soil solution K concentrations in the rhizosphere. Hinsinger\n(1998) reported that solution K concentrations can decrease by 2\u20133 orders of\nmagnitude to as little as 2\u20133 \u03bcM in the vicinity of plant roots, and at these\nconcentrations the release of structural and interlayer K can occur at high rates\n(Springob and Richter 1998, Fig. 7.8). However, it is also clear that this dissolution\nprocess is accentuated by root exudates and other rhizosphere characteristics (e.g.,\nlow pH). For example, plants can release conjugate bases of a variety of organic\nacids and those anions complex Al, contributing to dissolution of aluminosilicate\n[framework minerals like feldspars (Chap. 4). Roots of maize (Zea mays L.) and rape](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n(Brassica napus L.) can release citrate and malate (Hoffland et al. 1989; Pellet et al.\n[1995), while roots of bak choi (Brassica rapa ssp.) (Wang et al. 2000) and radish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_rapa)\n(Raphanus raphanistrum ssp.) (Zhang et al. 1997) have been shown to release\ntartrate. These ions accelerate the dissolution process at mineral surfaces by\ncomplexing and solubilizing Al [3+] from minerals. Z\u00f6rb et al. (2014) suggested that\n\n\n182 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nthe generation of these exudates is driven by the soil solution K concentration and\ncould be initiated when K concentrations fall to less than 10\u201320 \u03bcM. Plants also\nrelease hydronium ions, which lower the pH in the zone next to the root and\ncontribute to weathering by creating local charge imbalances when they form new\nbonds with oxygen ions at mineral surfaces (Brantley 2003). Much more detailed\n[coverage of these and other rhizosphere transformations is presented in Chap. 4.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n\n\n7.12 Nonexchangeable Potassium as a Functional Pool\n\n\nNonexchangeable K is soil K that is not measured by soil tests that rely on\nexchange or displacement of K by another cation. The current lack of analytical\ntechniques that can successfully differentiate between K that resides as structural K\nin feldspars; interlayer pools in micas, partially weathered micas and secondary clay\nminerals; or in neoformed K minerals in fertilized soils (pools 9\u201313 in Fig. 7.1)\npresents real problems for predicting the size and behavior of sources of K that are\npotentially bioavailable to plants. Collectively, these pools can make a major\ncontribution to the K uptake by crops. Hinsinger (2006) estimated that this aggregation of K pools could release up to 100 kg K ha [\ufffd][1] year [\ufffd][1], which is a significant\nproportion of plant K demand in many agricultural systems. This is substantiated by\nthe K budgets in the treatments without K fertilization of long-term fertilizer trials in\nEurope (Fig. 7.6). The contributions of interlayer and structural K to crop uptake will\nobviously vary with soil type and mineralogy. For example, Moody and Bell (2006)\ndemonstrated a significant contribution of nonexchangeable K (measured as the\ndifference between exchangeable K and K extracted using sodium tetraphenyl\nborate) to plant uptake in some Vertisols, but effectively no contribution in others.\nSubsequent work indicated that the majority of the nonexchangeable K taken up by\ndifferent plant species in the 15\u201330 soils studied was from dissolution of structural K\nrather than K release from near-edge interlayer positions. The apparent lack of\nsignificant release of K from near-edge interlayer positions in this study may reflect\nthe highly weathered nature of the Australian soils. Nonexchangeable, but nearedge, interlayer K could make a significant contribution to plant uptake from less\nweathered soils in temperate regions where partially weathered micas or vermiculite\nare present (Barr\u00e9 et al., 2007b, 2008).\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the main analytical methods used to\nquantify nonexchangeable K (extraction with boiling HNO 3 or sodium tetraphenyl\n[borate) are discussed in detail in Chap. 8. However, given the inability of current](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nanalytical soil test methods to differentiate between these nonexchangeable K\nsources, that is, structural and near-edge interlayer K, Hinsinger (2006) has\nsuggested they could be referred to collectively as \u201cnonexchangeable K.\u201d This\nterm has merit, as it recognizes the current limitations and uncertainty surrounding\ndiagnostic testing and the variability in interpretation of soil test results across soil\ntypes with differing mineralogy.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 183\n\n\n7.13 Classifying Soils According to Their Potassium\nBehavior\n\n\nSoil Taxonomy, the system of soil classification used in the United States (Soil\nSurvey Staff 2014) groups soils into classes that have similar behavior, use and\nmanagement, and productivity. The lowest level of classification is the family level,\nwhich emphasizes soil properties relevant to the potential use and management of\nthe soil. Differentiating criteria at the family level include particle size classes,\nmineralogy classes, and cation activity classes. In the United States, Soil Taxonomy\nis the basis for soil surveys, which are made by the National Cooperative Soil\nSurvey. These surveys are typically intended for general agriculture and land use\nplanning and are made at scales ranging from 1:12,000 to 1:31,680. Although soil\nsurveys are not intended to be used for making fertilizer recommendations, they\ncould be used to group and identify soils with potential for K fixation or release. This\nwould help researchers identify sites for future K fertility trials or help producers and\nconsultants identify soils that need K fertility recommendations designed to compensate for K fixation or release. Currently, Soil Taxonomy does not include specific\nclassification criteria for recognizing soils with potential for K fixation or release.\nHowever, the system could be modified by extrapolating mineralogical and\nK-fixation data for horizons at well-studied sites to other land areas.\nEffective recognition of K-fixing or K-releasing soils in Soil Taxonomy would\nrequire knowledge of the particle size distribution, mineralogy, and cation exchange\ncapacity of multiple soil horizons, including the surface horizons that are not\ncurrently used in the system\u2019s mineralogy classes at the family level. An assessment\nof the soil\u2019s cation exchange capacity (e.g., before and after heating a K-saturated\nsample of clay fractionated from the soil, as described by Ransom et al. (1988))\ncould be combined with the properties listed above to identify soils with a significant\npotential for buffering plant-available K. Additional work would be required to see if\na similar procedure could be used to recognize soils with a potential for K-fixation\nusing other soil classification systems such as the World Reference Base for Soil\nResources and the Australian Soil Classification System. However, neither soil\nclassification system includes clay mineralogy and cation exchange capacity as\nclassification criteria used to predict soil responses for use and management.\nEven without formal revisions to soil classification systems, informal, local\nmodels to predict the K-supply characteristics and locations of K-fixing or\nK-releasing soils could be useful. For example, O\u2019Green et al. (2008) developed a\nmethod to classify the K-supply characteristics of soils in vineyards of the Lodi\nWinegrape District of California in the United States. Their approach correlated\nreadily available soil survey information about parent material age, mineralogy, and\nweathering intensity with levels of exchangeable K and the K-fixation potential for\nsoils in the region. While their model was specifically designed for this region or for\nwine-grape cropping systems, it is innovative and the concepts could be applied\nelsewhere.\n\n\n184 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\n7.14 Lessons Learned from Long-Term Experiments\n\n\nExhaustive cropping currently remains the most effective way of quantifying the\nbioavailable fraction of a nonexchangeable K pool, although these results may vary\nconsiderably with crop species (and perhaps even genotypes) and experimental\nconditions. However, long-term experiments offer an opportunity to explore the\nimportance of nonexchangeable soil K reserves, i.e., pools 9\u201312 in Fig. 7.1. An\nexample that quantifies the long-term impact of different K inputs/balances on soil K\ncontent in different K pools at the end of a monitoring period is the study of Blake\net al. (1999), with this extended to cover other long-term experiments in France,\nGermany, and Poland by Hinsinger (2002, 2006, Fig. 7.6). Others have measured the\nchange in soil K stocks in different pools over a defined period between treatment\nsequences or soil sampling events, e.g., Kaminski et al. (2010) and Madaras et al.\n(2014). Still others have reported qualitative changes in secondary phyllosilicate\nminerals in response to either K fertilizer use or unbalanced K removal (Barr\u00e9 et al.\n2007b, 2008). Collectively, such studies have been able to demonstrate the dynamic\nnature of soil K, the importance of mineralogy on K fixation and release (the latter by\neither desorption or dissolution) and the impact of net K balance on the direction of\nK fluxes.\nMany of these studies cannot conclusively identify the pools of soil K that\ncontribute to the overall K balance of the systems investigated. Some are limited\nby their soil sampling strategy, which typically focusses on the cultivated layer\n\n\u2013\n(0 25 cm) or even the upper 10 cm in minimum and zero-tillage systems. The\nsources and sinks of K may well be from deeper soil layers, especially in tropical and\nsubtropical environments where soil temperatures do not limit root exploration and\naccess to subsoil moisture. Nutrient stores in deeper layers are keys to productive\nagricultural systems (Bell et al. 2009), but changes in soil K in these layers are\ntypically not measured (Prasad 2009). Pradier et al. (2017) have measured significant\nchanges of K pools at considerable depth, down to 4 m when sampling the rhizosphere of eucalypt trees in Brazil. They observed an increase of exchangeable K in\nthe rhizosphere, possibly related to weathering of K-bearing minerals, as speculated\nby these authors. Even those that have endeavored to account for changes in the\namount of available K in different profile layers have found it difficult to precisely\nidentify the K pool acting as the predominant source or sink for K. This relates to the\n[limitations of existing soil test methods, discussed in Chap. 8, which are effectively](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nlimited to identifying changes in exchangeable and nonexchangeable K. Both measures will access different K pools in soils with different mineralogy, making\nextrapolation to other soil types and cropping systems challenging.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 185\n\n\n7.15 Prognosis\n\n\nA better understanding of the allocation of K bioavailability to plants among\ndifferent functional pools in agricultural soils will allow the development of more\ndefensible and economically justifiable fertilizer recommendations. This will particularly apply to soils where there are significant amounts of nonexchangeable K in\neither (or both of) three-dimensional framework or layer silicate minerals. The\ndevelopment of such an understanding will require the use of a combination of\ndiagnostic soil K tests, including those that will provide an assessment of the likely\navailability of applied K fertilizer. While this will increase the costs of soil testing,\nthe greater certainty provided around understanding the K status of the particular\nfield under management will add considerable confidence to fertilizer decisions.\nFurther research is clearly required on this topic, as is research on soil sampling\nprotocols that allow quantification of K status in the soil layers from which the crop\nacquires significant quantities of K.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAdamo P, Barr\u00e9 P, Cozzolino V, Di Meo V, Velde B (2016) Short term clay mineral release and\n[re-capture of potassium in a Zea mays field experiment.
