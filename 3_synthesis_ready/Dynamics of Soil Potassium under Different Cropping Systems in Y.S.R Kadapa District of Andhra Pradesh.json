This circumstance puts Indian\nagriculture under pressure to produce more food on\ndwindling arable land. Thus, intensive cropping is\nnecessary and future food production will grow increasingly reliant on mineral fertilizers, which have\nbecome indispensable for assuring adequate food\nproduction and reversing soil productivity reduction\ndue to nutrient depletion.\n\n\nPotassium is third most important plant nutrient\nwhich is absorbed by plant is in larger amount than\n\n\n426\n\n\nany other mineral element except nitrogen and it is\none of the three main pillars of balanced fertilizer use,\nalong with nitrogen and phosphorus. The potassium is\nmobile in plant, unlike other major nutrients, it\u2019s not\nthe integral part of the plant component but, it plays\na vital role in enzyme activity, acts as a catalyst for\ncarbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, translocation of assimilates, synthesis of proteins, as well as\nformation, break down and translocation of starch,\nmaintains water balance, agronomic productivity and\nsustainability (Mangel 1985).\n\n\nThe results of long term fertilizer experiments in\nIndia revealed that by growing crops without K for\nlonger periods lead the mining of soil native K and\nthere by declining available K. The availability of\nK in soil is governed by both organic and inorganic\nforms and prevailing soil chemical environment.\nAvailability of native K to plants is largely regulated\nby the dynamic equilibrium existing between different\nforms of K viz., water soluble-K, which is taken up\nby the plants and microbes directly (Sparks 2000);\nexchangeable-K, held by negative charges on clay\nparticles, humic substances and it is exchangeable\nwith cations and readily available to plants, non-exchangeable or fixed-K, which is trapped between\nthe layers of dioctahedral and trioctahedral micas,\nvermiculites and it is sparingly available to plants\n(Sparks and Huang 1985) and while lattice \u2013K or\nmineral or structural K, an integral part of primary\nK bearing minerals which compraises 98% of total\nK. Knowledge on these different potassium fractions\nin soils is essential for potassium management to\ndetermine long term sustainability of cropping systems. To formulate sound fertilizer recommendation,\npotassium supplying capacity of soil is essential.\nThis will depend not only on the available K content\nof soil, but also knowledge on different forms of K\nand their relationship among themselves is required.\nKeeping this in view, the present study was under\ntaken to assess dynamics of soil potassium under\ndifferent cropping systems in Y.S.R Kadapa district\nof Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\n\n\nThe present study was carried out in Y.S.R Kadapa\n\n\n\ndistrict of Andhra Pradesh. The district is situated at\n\nGeographical Co-ordination of 13\u00b0 43\u2019 to 15\u00b0 14\u2019 of\nNorthern latitude and 77\u00b0 55\u2019 to 79\u00b0 29\u2019 of the Eastern\n\nlongitude. This district lies in river basin of Pennar.\nThe district is classified as drought Prone area due to\nscanty and uneven distribution of rain fall. The annual\nrainfall of the district is 700 mm. Five soil samples\nfrom each cropping system at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm\ndepths were collected from the Y.S.R. district viz.,\nfallow \u2013 bengalgram, sunflower \u2013 sesame, paddy\n\u2013 paddy, groundnut mono cropping and groundnut \u2013\ngroundnut cropping sequences during 2018-19. Soil\nsample were air-dried, ground in a wooden pestle with\nmortar and passed through a 2mm stainless steel sieve\nand used for determining various soil properties by\nfollowing standard procedures.\n\n\nWater soluble K was extracted by shaking the\nsoil water suspension in the ratio of 1:5 for 5 min\nthen filtered and K was determined (Jackson 1973)\nand available K was extracted with neutral normal\n\nammonium acetate with 1:5 soil solution ratio and\nshaking for five minutes (Hanway and Heidel 1952).\nThe exchangeable K was obtained by subtracting\nwater-soluble K from available K. The non-exchangeable K was estimated by following the method as\ndescribed by Wood and De Turk (1941). Lattice-K\nwas calculated from the difference between total K\nand the sum of NH 4 OAc-K and nonexchangeable K\n(Wiklander 1954). Total K in soil was estimated by\nHF-HClO 4 digestion method using platinum crucibles as outlined by Pratt (1965). Potassium in all the\nextracts was estimated flame photometrically. The\nstatistical analysis was done to understand correlation\namong different forms of potassium and with soil\nproperties\n\n\n**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**\n\n\nDistribution of different forms of potassium under\ndifferent cropping systems tabulated in Table 1.\n\n\n**Available K**\n\n\nThe available K content of surface soils varied from\n73.65 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nto 282.80 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence\nwith mean values of 84.55 and 262.80 mg kg- [1] and\n\n\n427\n\n\n**Table 1.** Distribution of different forms of potassium under different cropping systems.\n\n\nCropping systems                        Available K                Water soluble K              Exchangeable K\n(mg kg [-1] )                    (mg kg [-1] )                   (mg kg [-1] )\n0-15 cm      15-30 cm      0-15 cm      15-30 cm      0-15 cm      15-30 cm\n\n\nMin 146.75 113.80 12.65 5.95 134.10 107.85\n\n1.

In sub-surface soils available K content\nvaried from 51.30 mg kg- [1] in groundnut monocropping system to 160.90 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence with mean values of 55.08 and 151.73\nmg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K 0.17\nand 1.58, respectively.\n\n\nThe highest available potassium was observed in\nsoils of paddy-paddy cropping system in both surface\nand sub-surface soils, which might be due to contin\n\n\nuous application of potassic fertilizers to both the\ncrops and lowest available potassium was recorded\nin sunflower-sesame cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system in surface and sub-surface\nsoils, respectively which might be due to continuous\nless application of potassic fertilizers application\nthan crop needed or imbalanced fertilization in crop\nnutrition caused mining of its native pools. Similar\nresults reported by Katkar _et al_ . (2011). The data\nfurther revealed that highest available potassium was\nobserved in surface soils than in sub-surface soils in\n\n\n428\n\n\nall cropping systems, which might be attributed to\npresence of vegetation or upward translocation of K\nfrom lower layers through capillary rise or ground\nwater as reported by Lungmuana _et al_ . (2014).\n\n\n**Water soluble K**\n\n\nThe water soluble K content of surface soils varied\nfrom 5.5 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping\nsystem to 43.30 mg kg- [1] in groundnut -groundnut\ncropping sequence with mean values of 9.52 and\n37.24 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K\n0.07 and 0.18, respectively. In sub-surface soils water\nsoluble K content varied from 5.05 mg kg- [1] in sunin\nflower-sesame cropping system to 17.25 mg kg- [1]\ngroundnut -groundnut cropping sequence with mean\nvalues of 6.63 and 14.35 mg kg- [1] and their per cent\ncontribution to total K 0.03 and 0.18, respectively.\n\n\nThe highest water soluble K was observed in\nsoils of groundnut-groundnut cropping system in\nsurface and sub-surface soils, which might be due to\naddition of fertilizers, presence of potassium bearing\nminerals while lowest water soluble K was observed\nin sunflower-sesame cropping system at both depths,\nwhich might be due to exhaustive nature of crops.\nThe data further revealed that highest water soluble\nK was observed in surface soils than in sub-surface\n\nsoils in all cropping systems, which might be due to\ncapillary movement of potassium from lower depth\nto upper portion reported by Hebsur and Gali (2011).\n\n\n**Exchangeable K**\n\n\nThe exchangeable K content of surface soils varied\nfrom 68.10 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping\nsystem to 254.10 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping\nsequence with mean values of 75.03 and 236.77\nmg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K\n0.52 and 1.20, respectively. In sub-surface soils\nexchangeable K content varied from 43.70 mg kg- [1]\nin groundnut monocropping system to 144.05 mg\nkg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence with mean\nvalues of 46.07 and 138.84 mg kg- [1] and their per cent\ncontribution to total K 0.14 and 1.44, respectively.\n\n\nThe highest exchangeable K was observed in\nsoils of paddy-paddy cropping system in both surface\n\n\n\nand sub-surface soils, which might be due to high\ndose of K fertilizers were applied to paddy in both\nseasons or due to the fact that soils contain relatively\nhigher clay per cent which offered more exchangeable sites for K. these results were in agreement with\n(Hebsur and Gali 2011) and lowest exchangeable K\nwas observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nand groundnut monocropping system in surface and\nsub-surface soils respectively might be due to exhaustive nature of sunflower and sesame crops and low\nutilization under groundnut monocropping system or\ndue to non replenishment of K from the other (Rao\n_et al_ . 2013). The results further revealed that highest\nexchangeable K was observed in surface soils than in\nsub-surface soils in all cropping systems.\n\n\n**Non-exchangeable K**\n\n\nThe non-exchangeable K content of surface soils\nvaried from 309.95 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame\ncropping system to 970.35 mg kg- [1] in fallow-bengalgram cropping sequence with mean values of 337.35\nand 896.49 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution\nto total K 2.33 and 5.08, respectively. In sub-surface\nsoils non-exchangeable K content varied from 238.80\nmg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system to\n623.00 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence\nwith mean values of 275.13 and 602.53 mg kg- [1] and\ntheir per cent contribution to total K 1.15 and 6.26,\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe highest non-exchangeable K was observed\nin soils of fallow-bengalgram cropping system and\npaddy-paddy in surface and sub-surface soils, respectively which might be due to higher percentage\nof clay in these soils and lowest non-exchangeable K\nwas observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nat both depths, which might be due to continuous\ncropping with less application of K fertilizers may\ndecreased K content in these cropping systems. The\ndata further revealed that highest non-exchangeable\nK was observed in surface soils than in sub-surface\nsoils in all cropping systems. These findings were in\nagreement with Mazumdar _et al._ 2014.\n\n\n**Lattice K**\n\n\nThe lattice K content of surface soils varied from\n\n\n11498.10 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping\nsystem to 23326.60 mg kg- [1] in groundnut-groundnut\ncropping sequence with mean values of 14038.10 and\n20116.32 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to\ntotal K 94.00 and 97.08, respectively. In sub-surface\nsoils lattice K content varied from 6460.20 mg kg- [1]\nin groundnut-groundnut cropping system to 35828.20\nmg kg- [1] in groundnut monocropping sequence with\nmean values of 7219.58 and 31708.88 mg kg- [1] and\ntheir per cent contribution to total K 92.18 and 98.68,\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe highest lattice K was observed in soils of\ngroundnut-groundnut cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system in surface and sub-surface\nsoils, respectively. These findings were in accordance\nwith Sawarkar _et al_ . 2013 which might be due to these\nsoils were derived from potassic bearing minerals\nhowever, lowest lattice K was observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system and groundnut-groundnut\ncropping system in surface and sub-surface soils,\nrespectively. The data further revealed that highest lattice K was observed in surface soils than in\n\nsub-surface soils in all cropping systems, except in\nfallow-bengalgram cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system which might be attributed to\nincrease in finer fractions of soil particles at lower\ndepth.\n\n\n**Total K**\n\n\nThe total K content of surface soils varied from\n11920 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nto 24190 mg kg- [1] in groundnut-groundnut cropping\nsequence with mean values of 14460 and 20952 mg\nkg- [1], respectively. In sub-surface soils total K content\nvaried from 6990 mg kg- [1 ] in groundnut-groundnut\n\n\n\n429\n\n\ncropping system to 33330 mg kg- [1] in groundnut\nmonocropping sequence with mean values of 7834\nand 32134 mg kg- [1], respectively.\n\n\nThe highest total K was observed in soils of\ngroundnut-groundnut cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system in surface and sub-surface\nsoils, respectively which might be due to predominance of potassium bearing primary minerals and\nlowest total K was observed in sunflower-sesame\ncropping system and groundnut-groundnut cropping\nsystem in surface and sub-surface soils, respectively.\nThe data further revealed that highest total K was\nobserved in surface soils than in sub-surface soils in\n\nall cropping systems, except in fallow-bengalgram\ncropping system and groundnut monocropping system. Similar results were reported by Mazumdar _et_\n_al._ (2014).\n\n\n**Correlation among forms of potassium**\n\n\nCorrelation between forms of potassium with soil\nproperties in surface and sub-surface soils, tabulated\nin Tables 2-3, respectively.\n\n\nIn surface soils available K was positively\nand significantly correlated with water soluble K\n(r = 0.416*), exchangeable K (r = 0.987**) and\nnon-exchangeable K (r = 0.791**). Similar results\nwere obtained by Swamanna _et al._ (2015) under rice\ngrowing soils of Kurnool district of A.P.

Non-exchangeable K was highly and significantly correlated with available K (r = 0.791**),\nwater soluble K (r = 744**) and exchangeable K (r =\n0.708**). Similar observations were made by Dhakad\n_et al_ . (2017), Lakaria _et al_ . (2012), Prasad _et al._\n_(_ 2010), Swamanna _et al._ (2015). Non-exchangeable\nK positively and significantly correlated with lattice K\n(r = 705**) and total K (r = 0.741**). Lattice K was\nhighly and significantly correlated with water soluble\nK (r = 0.665**) non-exchangeable K (r = 0.705**)\nand total K (r = 0.999**). Total K was highly and\nsignificantly correlated with available K (r = 0.421*),\nwater soluble K (r = 0.682**), non-exchangeable K (r\n= 0.741**) and lattice K (r = 0.999**). Similar results\nwere obtained by Dhakad _et al_ . (2017) indicating\nthat these relationships confirmed that availability of\nexchangeable, nonexchangeable and total potassium\ncould significantly determine potentially available\npotassium in these soils.\n\n\nAll the forms of K showed a positive trend of\ncorrelation among themselves largely corroborating\nthe well-known concept of existence of a dynamic\nequilibrium among different forms of K present in\nsoil through which K supply to the roots of crop\nplants are directly or indirectly ensured as reported\n\n\n\nLungmuana _et al._ 2014.\n\n\nIn sub-surface soils available K was highly and\nsignificantly correlated with exchangeable K (r =\n0.766**) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.943**).\nSimilar observations were made by Jatav and Dewangan (2012). Whereas available K also showed\nnegative and significant correlation with lattice K (r\n= -0.482*) and total K (r = -0.472*). Water soluble\nK was positively and significantly correlated with\nnon-exchangeable K (r = 0.486*). Exchangeable K\nwas highly and significantly correlated with available\nK (r = 0.766**) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.701*).\nSimilar results reported by Jatav and Dewangan\n(2012) Rajeevana and Kavitha (2017). Non-exchangeable K was highly and significantly correlated\nwith available K (r = 0.943**), water soluble K (r =\n0.486*) and exchangeable K (r = 0.701**). Similar\nobservations were made by Rajeevana and Dewangan\n(2017). Non-exchangeable K was negatively and\nsignificantly correlated with lattice K (r = -0.472*)\nand total K (r = -0.462*). Lattice K was highly and\nsignificantly correlated with total K (r = 0.999**)\nwhile it was negatively and significantly correlated\nwith available K  (r = -0.482*) and non-exchangeable\nK (r = -0.472*). Total K was highly and significantly\ncorrelated with lattice K (r = 0.999**) but it was negatively and significantly correlated with available K\n(r = -0.472*) and non-exchangeable K (r = -0.462*).\n\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n\nBased on these results, it is therefore suggested that\nK removal by the crop must be supplemented to\nsustain the soil fertility either by K application or by\n\n\ncrop straw incorporation to the soil. Soil K fractions\nvaried with depth and cropping sequences. Soil K\nfractions were found in the order lattice K > non-ex\nchangeable K > available K > exchangeable K > water\nsoluble K. Under irrigated conditions all the forms\nof potassium were highest in paddy-paddy cropping\nsystem followed by groundnut-groundnut cropping\nsystem and sunflower-sesame cropping system while\nunder rainfed conditions all the forms of potassium\nwere highest in fallow-bengalgram cropping system\nfollowed by groundnut monocropping system. The\nresults and the methodology adopted in the present\nstudy will be useful in assessing forms of K under\ndifferent cropping systems. These results would not\nonly useful for the study area, but also in other cropping systems across the globe.\n\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n\nDhakad H, Yadav SS, Jamra S, Arya V, Sharma K, Gaur D (2017)\nStatus and distribution of different forms of potassium in soils\nof Gwalior district (MP) _Int J Che Stu_ 5: 161-164.\nElbaalawy AM, Benbi DK, Benipal DS (2016) Potassium forms in\nrelation to clay mineralogy other soil properties in different\nagro-ecological sub-regions of Northern India. _Agric Res J_\n53: 200-206.\n\nHanway JJ, Heidel H (1952) Soil analysis methods, as used in Iowa\nState. _College Soil Testing Laboratory, Iowa, Agriculture_\n57: 1-31.\n\nHebsur NS, Gali SK ( 2011) Potassium dynamics in soils under\ndifferent cropping systems of Karnataka.
