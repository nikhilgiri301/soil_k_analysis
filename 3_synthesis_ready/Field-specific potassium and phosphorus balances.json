We used the\nQUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) model with\n>8000 plot-level observations to estimate the relationship between grain yield\nand nutrient accumulation in above-ground dry matter of irrigated rice with\nharvest index 0.4. Predicted reciprocal internal efficiencies (RIEs) at 60% to\n70% of yield potential corresponded to plant accumulation of 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P,\nand 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain yield. These RIEs enable determination of plant\nrequirements for K and P and net output of K and P in harvested grain and\nremoved crop residues at a target yield. Yield gains for nutrient applied to\nirrigated rice averaged 12% for K and 9% for P for 525 to 531 observations. For\nfields without certain yield gain, fertilizer K and P requirements can be\ndetermined by a partial maintenance approach (i.e., fertilizer input < output in\nnutrient balance), which considers nutrient supply mediated through soil\nprocesses and balances trade-offs between financial loss with full maintenance\nrates and risk of excessive nutrient depletion without nutrient application. When\nyield gains to an added nutrient are certain, partial maintenance plus yield gain\ncan be used to determine fertilizer requirements. The SSNM-based approach and\nalgorithms enable rapid development of field-specific K and P management.\n\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\n\n_Oryza sativa_\n\n\n\n**Keywords** Field-specific nutrient management nutrient balance SSNM rice \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\nwheat \ufffd maize\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nRoland J Buresh\n\n1 International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), DAPO Box 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines;\n\ne-mail:r.buresh@cgiar.org.\nMirasol F Pampolino ChristianWitt \ufffd\nInternational Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), Southeast Asia Program, PO Box 500 GPO,\nPenang 10670, Malaysia\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n_Presented\ufffdat\ufffdIPI-OUAT-IPNI\ufffdInternational\ufffdSymposium._\n_Published\ufffdin\ufffdPlant\ufffdSoil\ufffd2010.335:35-64.\ufffdPrinted\ufffdhere\ufffdwith\ufffdpermission\ufffdfrom\ufffdPlant\ufffdSoil_\n\n\n\n343\n\n\n_**Abbreviations**_ _CRR; crop residue retained: FK; fertilizer K: FM; fraction of full_\n_maintenance: FP; fertilizer P: GY; grain yield: HI; harvest index: IE; internal_\n_efficiency: IGP; Indo-Gangetic Plains: QUEFTS; Quantitative Evaluation of the_\n_Fertility of Tropical Soils: RE; recovery efficiency: RIE; reciprocal internal_\n_efficiency: RTDP; Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity: SSNM; site-_\n_specific nutrient management_\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\n\nRice ( _Oryza sativa_ L.) is the main staple food crop in Asia, which accounts for\nabout 90% of global rice production. Irrigated rice covers half the rice-growing\narea and accounts for about 75% of total rice production (Maclean et al. 2002).\nContinuous rice cultivation with two and occasionally three crops per year is\ncommon in tropical Asia. Rice in rotation with other crops, particularly wheat\n( _Triticum aestivum_ L.), is common in subtropical Asia (Ladha et al. 2009), and\nthe rotation of maize ( _Zea mays_ L.) with irrigated rice is increasing in importance\ninAsia (Ali et al. 2008). Fertilizer use has contributed to increasing production of\nrice-based systems since the Green Revolution, and the effective use of\nsupplemental nutrients remains vital for essential increases in the production of\nrice and associated cereal staples to meet rising demand for food security and\npolitical stability.\nPlots of land for cultivation of rice-based cropping systems in Asia are\ntypically small and spatially variable in management. Large variations in nutrient\nbalances and nutrient requirements can exist across small distances within a\nlandscape due to differences in retention of crop residues, historical fertilizer use,\ninput of organic materials, inherent soil fertility, and crop yield attainable with\nfarmers' management practices. Existing blanket fertilizer recommendations for\nlarge areas or agro-ecological zones fail to account for these variations in crop\nneeds for supplemental nutrients among fields within small distances.\nApproaches and algorithms for tailoring fertilizer requirements to field-specific\nneeds of crops are necessary to further improve productivity and profitability\nfrom fertilizer use.\n\nAlgorithms for determining fertilizer recommendations are often derived\nfrom factorial fertilizer trials conducted across multiple locations. Site-specific\nnutrient management (SSNM) for rice arose in the mid-1990s as an alternative\napproach for dynamic management of nutrients to optimize supply and demand\nof a nutrient within a specific field in a particular cropping season (Dobermann et\nal. 2004). The SSNM approach reasoned that fertilizer requirements should be\nbased on more generic relationships such as internal nutrient efficiency, which is\nthe amount of grain yield produced per unit of nutrient accumulated in aboveground plant dry matter (Witt et al. 1999). The QUEFTS (Quantitative\nEvaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) model developed by Janssen et al.\n\n\n\n(1990) was used to provide a generic empirical relationship between grain yield\nand nutrient accumulation in rice plants (Witt et al. 1999), which was\nsubsequently combined with the estimation of attainable yield, nutrient balances,\nand probable yield gains from added nutrient to determine field-specific fertilizer\nrequirements for rice (Witt and Dobermann 2004).\nThe determination of field-specific fertilizer N requirements in the SSNM\napproach for rice has subsequently been modified to use a target agronomic\nefficiency of fertilizer N use, which is the increase in yield per unit of fertilizer N\napplied, and an estimated field-specific yield gain to applied N (Buresh and Witt\n2007; Witt et al. 2007). The determination of fertilizer K and P requirements in\nthe SSNM approach, on the other hand, has continued to use internal nutrient\nefficiency combined with estimates of attainable yield, nutrient balances, and\nprobable yield gains from added nutrient within specific fields (Witt et al. 2007).\nThe SSNM approach has recently been applied to wheat (Khurana et al. 2008)\nand maize (Witt et al. 2009).\nWitt et al. (2007) advocated use of nutrient balances with full maintenance of\nsoil fertility, in which the applications of fertilizer K and P are sufficient to match\nthe output of the nutrients. Such an approach does not adjust fertilizer K and P\nrates for enhanced availability of nutrients through soil biological, chemical, and\nphysical processes. Moreover, the application of fertilizer at full maintenance can\nresult in financial loss when the crop does not respond to the added nutrient. An\nincrease in farm-gate fertilizer prices relative to the farm-gate price of produce\nfurther increases this financial loss. Failure to apply K or P, on the other hand, can\nresult in nutrient depletion and eventual loss in yield, which could take a number\nof seasons before detection (Abdulrachman et al. 2006). The importance of soil\nbiological, chemical, and physical processes on nutrient availability and the\ndramatic fluctuations in fertilizer prices highlight the need to re-examine full\nmaintenance approaches for determining fertilizer K and P requirements.\nAlgorithms are needed for determining fertilizer K and P rates that effectively\nconsider soil processes and soil characteristics mediating K and P availability and\nbalance the trade-offs between profitability in the short term and sustainable\nproductivity in the longer term.\nTechnological approaches and algorithms for developing fertilizer\nrequirements tailored to field-specific needs of crops in irrigated rice-based\ncropping systems must be based on robust scientific principles applicable across\nthe field-level variability and diversity of crop-growing conditions. At the same\ntime, approaches must be relatively simple with minimal characterization or\ninterviewing of farmers for each field in order to ensure rapid, cost-effective\ndelivery of field-specific guidelines to millions of small-scale farmers.\nTechnological approaches and algorithms should strive to draw upon existing\nresearch information in order to avoid delays in reaching farmers with practical\nsolutions based on scientific principles.\n\n\n\n_Oryza sativa_\n\n\n\n_Triticum aestivum_\n\n\nthe rotation of maize ( _Zea mays_\n\n\n\n344 345\n\n\nNutrient balances and fertilizer requirements determined with SSNM for\nirrigated rice rely on reciprocal internal efficiency (RIE), which is the amount of\nthe nutrient in above-ground plant dry matter per tonne of grain production.\nValues currently used with SSNM for irrigated rice were derived with the\nQUEFTS model by Witt et al. (1999). Given the importance of RIE in\ndetermining fertilizer requirements, there is merit after a decade to re-examine\nwith a larger data set the robustness of RIEs used for irrigated rice.\n\n\nThe objectives of this study are:\n1) To determine, using a large data set for irrigated rice from across Asia, the\nrelationship between rice grain yield and N, P, and K accumulation in total\nabove-ground plant dry matter of mature rice, and through this to confirm\nRIE values for K and P for use in determining fertilizer requirements for\nsemi-dwarf irrigated rice;\n2) To assess at the field level through K and P nutrient balances the factors,\nuncertainties, and emerging trends affecting the determination of fieldspecific fertilizer K and P requirements for rice\u2013rice, rice\u2013wheat, and\nrice\u2013maize cropping systems; and\n3) To examine and compare revised approaches for calculating field-specific K\nand P fertilizer rates that can consider the net effect of soil processes and soil\ncharacteristics mediating K and P availability and balance the trade-offs\nbetween short-term profitability of fertilizer use and longer term\nsustainability of the productivity of high-yielding rice-based systems.\n\n\nWe provide alternatives to factorial field trials and rigid nutrient balances for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P requirements. The framework we present does not\nspecifically consider soil\u2013plant\u2013nutrient interactions and biological processes\nmediating nutrient availability.\n\n\n**Materials and methods**\n\n\nInternal nutrient efficiencies for rice\n\n\nThe QUEFTS model (Janssen et al. 1990) as modified and described by Witt et al.\n(1999) was used with a large data set to develop relationships between grain yield\nand nutrient accumulation in total above-ground plant dry matter of rice at\nmaturity. The data originated from irrigated rice production areas in seven\ncountries across tropical and subtropical environments in Asia (Table 1). Data for\nrice grain yield, harvest index, and plant accumulation of N, P, and K were\ncompiled from various research projects and then grouped into separate data sets\nfor N, P, and K. The data set for each nutrient contained results from all plots with\nmeasurements for both plant accumulation of the nutrient and grain yield\n(Table 1).\n\n\n\n**Table 1** Origin of data used to examine the relationship between rice grain yield\nand accumulation of N, P, and K in total above-ground dry matter at\nmaturity\n\n|Country|Type of experiment|Years|Number of plot-level observations (n)|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Country|Type of experiment|Years|HI = 0.4 to 0.63<br>a|HI = 0.4 to 0.63<br>a|HI = 0.4 to 0.63<br>a|HI = 0.2 to 0.4|HI = 0.2 to 0.4|HI = 0.2 to 0.4|\n|Country|Type of experiment|Years|N|P|K|N|P|K|\n|Bangladesh<br>China<br>India<br>Indonesia<br>Philippines<br>Thailand<br>Vietnam<br>Total|On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-station experiments<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-station experiments<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials|2000-2002<br>2000-2002<br>2001-2002<br>1998-2002<br>2001-2004<br>1997-2004<br>2001-2002<br>1997-2002<br>2001-2003<br>2001-2002<br>1997-2002<br>1991-2007<br>1997-2000<br>2002-2003<br>1997-2003|153<br> 259<br> 38<br> 415<br> 939<br> 2086<br> 110<br> 602<br> 144<br> 36<br> 616<br> 8279<br> 206<br> 150<br> 1474<br>15507|100<br>325<br>38<br>415<br>936<br>2086<br>72<br>602<br>144<br>36<br>616<br>1781<br>206<br>150<br>1441<br> 8948|99<br>325<br>38<br>415<br>939<br> 2086<br>72<br>599<br>144<br>36<br>616<br> 1783<br>206<br>150<br> 1475<br> 8983|29<br>98<br>3<br>10<br>5<br>110<br> 409<br>80<br>10<br> 68<br> 822|16<br>98<br>3<br>10<br>5<br>110<br>163<br>80<br>10<br>62<br>557|17<br>98<br>3<br>10<br>5<br>110<br> 163<br>80<br>10<br>68<br> 564|\n\n\n\na HI\ufffd=\ufffdharvest\ufffdindex\n\n\nIn each of the seven countries, except Thailand, data originated from both\nnutrient omission trials and fertilizer evaluation trials conducted in farmers'\n\nfields. Data from Bangladesh originated from research described by Alam et al.\n(2005). Data from on-farm trials before 2001 in other countries originated from\nthe Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity project (Dobermann et al. 2002).\nOn-farm data from 2001 onward originated from the subsequent Reaching\nToward Optimal Productivity project in which SSNM was further refined into\nguidelines for rice fertilization (Witt et al. 2007). Data from on-station\nexperiments in the Philippines originated from several long-term experiments\nthat included treatments without application of N, P, or K but ample application\nof other nutrients to meet crop needs. All data were for irrigated rice, and water\nrarely limited plant growth. In all cases semi-dwarf, modern high-yielding indica\ncultivars were grown with good agronomic practices. Comparable\nmethodologies for plant sampling, yield determination, and analysis for plant\nnutrients were used for collected data across the countries and experiments (Witt\net al. 1999).\nInternal nutrient efficiency (IE) is defined as the amount of grain yield in kg\nha (adjusted to 0.14 g water g fresh weight) produced per kg of plant N, P, or K \u20131 \u20131\naccumulation in above-ground plant dry matter expressed on an oven dry basis.\nReciprocal internal efficiency (RIE) is the amount of N, P, or K in the aboveground plant dry matter per 1000 kg of grain production. Harvest index is grain\n\n\n\n346 347\n\n\nyield expressed as a proportion of total above-ground plant dry matter (kg grain\nper kg total above-ground dry matter).\nRelationships between grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation as\npredicted by QUEFTS follow a linear-parabolic-plateau model, which depends\non an established maximum yield potential and coefficients of maximum nutrient\naccumulation (a) and maximum nutrient dilution (d). The a and d coefficients\nused in this paper were the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the measured IE (Witt et\nal. 1999). The predicted model is linear up to about 60% to 70% of the yield\npotential, which is seldom exceeded in farmers' fields. Internal nutrient\nefficiencies determined from the linear portion of the model represent the amount\nof nutrient needed to achieve a grain yield for modern high-yielding rice cultivars\nacross a wide range of yields attainable in farmers' fields (Witt et al. 1999).\nThe RIEs obtained for a data set with the QUEFTS model are intended for\nuse in calculating nutrient balances and fertilizer rates for modern high-yielding\nrice cultivars (Witt and Dobermann 2004) grown in farmers' fields with good\nagronomic practices and balanced use of N, P, and K fertilizers. We therefore\nexcluded from analysis with QUEFTS the data from plots either with suspected\nyield loss due to pests and disease or known to have unbalanced application of\nfertilizer.\n\nHarvest index for the entire data set ranged from 0.2 to 0.63. Low harvest\nindices suggest that disease, weeds, or insect pests resulted in some yield loss.\nLike Witt et al. (1999) and Haefele et al. (2003), we excluded data with harvest\nindex <0.4 from the determination of relationships and internal nutrient\nefficiencies with QUEFTS for semi-dwarf irrigated rice. About 5% of the\nobservations in the entire data set had harvest index <0.4 (Table 1).\nMean and median RIE for N, P, and K are consistently lower for rice grown\nwithout addition of the nutrient (nutrient omission plots) than with full\nfertilization due to dilution of the nutrient in plants not fertilized with the nutrient\n(Table 2). We therefore excluded all nutrient omission plot data from the analysis\nwith QUEFTS. Data from NPK fertilized plots with harvest index from 0.4 to\n0.63 as summarized in Table 2 were used to develop relationships and determine\nRIE with QUEFTS.\n\n\nDetermination of K and P balances\n\n\nSimple nutrient balances for K and P in the absence of fertilizer input were\ndetermined for a single rice crop, one rice\u2013wheat cropping cycle, and one\nrice\u2013maize cropping cycle. The balances took into account the fraction of\nretained crop residue and the inputs of nutrient from irrigation water and added\norganic materials.\nK balance for rice = K + K W OM + K CRr \u2013 K \u2013 (GY x RIE ) L r Kr [1]\n\n\n\n**Table 2** Reciprocal internal efficiency (RIE) for N, P, and K at maturity of\nirrigated rice as affected by location and treatment.

In the yield gain approach, the fertilizer K (FK) or\nfertilizer P (FP) (in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd) required to achieve a targeted yield (GY, expressed in \u20131\nt ha\ufffd\ufffd) is a function of the expected yield gain from the added nutrient, the RIE for \u20131\nthe nutrient, and the use efficiency of the applied nutrient:\nFK = (GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE 0K K [7]\nFP = (GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE 0P P [8]\nwhere GY 0K and GY are grain yield in t ha in the respective nutrient omission 0P \u20131\nplot in which the nutrient of interest is not applied, RIE of a nutrient is determined\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nCR CR\n\n\n\n0K K\n\n\n\nCR K K\n\n\n\n0P P\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nCR P P\n\n\n\n0K 0P\n\n\n\n350 351\n\n\nwith QUEFTS (Table 3), and use efficiency is the recovery efficiency of the\n\n\n\u20131\n\napplied nutrient (RE or RE ) expressed in kg kg\ufffd\ufffd. Because RIE is a constant to K P\nonly 60% to 70% of yield potential, the targeted grain yield should not exceed\nabout 70% of the yield potential when RIE is derived from the linear portion of\nthe QUEFTS model. Current yields of irrigated rice in Asia are generally below\n70% of yield potential (Dobermann et al. 2002).\nWitt and Dobermann (2004), using a data set for irrigated rice from across\n\n\n\u20131\n\nAsia, observed RE ranging from 0.35 to 0.66 kg kg and RE ranging from 0.22 K P\nto 0.35 kg kg between the median and the 75% quartile. Using these values \u20131\ntogether with RIE reported in Witt et al. (1999), they estimated as a general rule\nthat 25 kg K or 9 kg P are required to raise the respective nutrient-limited yield by\n1 t ha\ufffd\ufffd. The data set used by Witt and Dobermann (2004) did not include highly \u20131\nweathered soils (i.e., Oxisols and Ultisols) and volcanic soils (i.e., Andisols) with\nhigh capacity to fix P. P-fixing soils would likely have lower RE P and\ncorresponding higher fertilizer P requirements.\nExpected yield gains from the addition of a nutrient (GY \u2013 GY\ufffd) as obtained 0\nwith the nutrient omission plot technique can be used to determine the need of a\ncrop for fertilizer. We used results from 525 K omission plot trials and 531 P\nomission plot trials conducted in farmers' fields in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,\nand Vietnam (Table 1) to estimate the gain in rice yield from K and P fertilization.\nThe yield gain from application of K or P was determined from the difference in\ngrain yield between a plot with full fertilization of N, P, and K at sufficiently high\nrates to avoid limitation of these nutrients and an adjacent plot without\napplication of K or P (i.e., a nutrient omission plot) but with sufficient amounts of\nother nutrients to prevent their limitations on yield. The full-fertilized and\nnutrient omission plots in a given field were managed identically except for the\nomission of the nutrient of interest in plots without K or P. The difference in grain\nyield between the full-fertilized plot and the nutrient omission plot represents the\nexpected yield gain from addition of the nutrient to overcome the deficit between\nthe crop demand for the nutrient and indigenous supply of the nutrient from\nsources other than fertilizer.\n\nFertilizer K and P requirements to achieve a targeted yield can also be\nestimated with QUEFTS principles through nutrient input-output balances. Witt\nand Dobermann (2004) used the following equations based on nutrient balance to\nestimate fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) requirements (in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd) for a crop \u20131\nwith full maintenance of soil K and P.\n\nFK = (GY x RIE ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE ) \u2013 K K 0K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K L [9]\nFP = (GY x RIE ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE ) \u2013 P P 0P P CR \u2013 P OM [10]\nwhere K CR and P CR are K and P inputs with retained residues, and other inputs and\nlosses are as defined for equations 1 to 4.

We examined two options using nutrient\nbalances to calculate fertilizer K and P rates based on partial maintenance with\ngradual drawdown or depletion of soil K and P rather than full maintenance of\nsoil K and P. In one option with partial maintenance, fertilizer K and P\nrequirements are calculated as a fraction of full maintenance (FM) as shown in\nequations 11 and 12.\nFK with fractional K depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K ) xFM[11] L\nFP with fractional P depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM ) xFM [12]\nThe other option with partial maintenance allows drawdown of K or P from\n\n\n\u20131\n\nsoil reserves up to a threshold limit (K or P in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd), which is treated as an S S\ninput in the nutrient balance.\nFK with limited K depletion = GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM \u2013 K + S [13]\nFP with limited P depletion = GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM \u2013P S [14]\nThe FM, K, and P terms can be used to estimate the net effect of soil biological, S S\nchemical, and physical processes and soil characteristics on supply of soil K and\nP. When FM = 1 or when K or P = 0, the calculated fertilizer rates for a nutrient S S\n\nensure full maintenance with no drawdown of the nutrient from soil reserves.\n\nWe also combined the partial maintenance and yield gain approaches for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P when crop response to the nutrient is certain.\nFK with fractional K depletion = ((GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K ) x L\nFM) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE ) 0K K K [15]\nFP with fractional P depletion = ((GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM ) x FM) +\n((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE ) 0P P P [16]\nFK with limited K depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM \u2013 K + K ) + S L\n((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE ) 0K K K [17]\nFP with limited P depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM \u2013 P ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x S 0P\nRIE /RE ) P P [18]\nFertilizer K (FK) and P (FP) rates are set to zero whenever the value calculated in\nequations 11 through 18 is negative.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nK CR W OM S\n\n\n\nP CR OM S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nK CR W OM L\n\n\n\n0K K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM\n\n\n\n0P P P\n\n\n\nK CR W OM S L\n\n\n\n0K K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM S 0P\n\n\n\nP P\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nK 0K K CR W OM L\n\n\n\nP 0P P CR OM\n\n\n\nCR CR\n\n\n\n352 353\n\n\nQUEFTS using data from NPK fertilizer plots with harvest index = 0.4 to 0.63\n(Table 2) are shown in Fig. 1abc. The yield potential (10 t ha\ufffd\ufffd) and the limits for \u20131\ndata exclusion (upper and lower 2.5 percentiles) used to determine the functions\nrelating grain yield to the maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) of a\nnutrient are identical to those used by Witt et al. (1999) (Table 3). The IE at\nmaximum accumulation (a) of a nutrient (Table 3) represents the slope of the\nlower boundary line in Fig. 1, whereas the IE at maximum dilution (d) of a\nnutrient (Table 3) represents the slope of the upper boundary line in Fig. 1.\nObservations from nutrient omission plots are shown for no added N in Fig.\n1d, no added P in Fig. 1e, and no added K in Fig. 1f. In each case the presented\nboundary lines and QUEFTS model were derived using data from NPK fertilized\nplots (Table 3). In the absence of a nutrient, many observations concentrated near\n\n\n\nthe upper boundary line for IE, which generally reflects severe nutrient\n\u20131 deficiency. High IE for a nutrient in plots where the nutrient is omitted (Fig. 1def)\ncorresponds to markedly lower RIE for nutrient omission plots than for NPK\nfertilized plots (Table 2). For P and K about 5% of the total plot-level\nobservations were from nutrient omission plots. In these cases, the inclusion of\nnutrient omission plots in the data set had no pronounced effect on the calculated\nRIE. For N, for which 14% of the total plot-level observations were from N\nomission plots, the inclusion of N omission plots in the data set reduced the\ncalculated RIE by 3% (Table 2).\nThe IEs for N, P, and K were relatively low at low harvest indices (Fig. 2). At\nharvest index = 0.2 to 0.4, many observations for the relationship of grain yield\nand plant N, P, or K were concentrated near the lower boundary line determined\nwith QUEFTS using data from NPK fertilizer plots with harvest index = 0.4 to\n0.63. Such low IE in the absence of biotic or abiotic stress would reflect excess or\n\nluxuriant plant uptake of a nutrient. In this study with semi-dwarf, modern highyielding rice cultivars, the low harvest indices probably arose from loss in grain\nyield relative to dry matter production due to non-nutrient constraints such as\ndisease, insect pests, or water deficit. As harvest index increased, the\nobservations increasingly concentrated nearer to the QUEFTS-derived\nrelationship for grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\u20131\n\nas The RIEs for N, P, and K increased with decreasing harvest index (Table 5).\n\nThe effect of harvest index on RIE was most pronounced for K and least\npronounced for P, reflecting the relatively high proportion of plant K and low\nportion of plant P that accumulates in crop residue rather than grain. The reliable\ndetermination of nutrient balances that include nutrient inputs from crop residues\nis consequently relatively more reliant on a robust RIE value for K than for P (see\nequations 5 and 6).\nThe RIE estimated as the mean or median of the data set for NPK fertilizer\n\nplots (Table 2) was larger than the RIE derived from the linear portion of the\nQUEFTS model (Table 3). QUEFTS predicted the balanced nutrient\naccumulation of 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P and 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain across a\nrange of grain yields up to about 70% of the yield potential. The corresponding\nvalues obtained from means for the entire data set were 16.4 kg N, 3.2 kg P, and\n17.8 kg K per tonne of grain (Table 2). The RIEs for nutrients are lower with\nQUEFTS because values derived with QUEFTS are from the slope for only the\nlinear portion of the predicted relationship. This is confirmed by the increase in\nRIE predicted by QUEFTS as target yield increases above 60% to 70% of the\nyield potential (Table 6).\nAn objective of this study was to establish a confirmed robust RIE for N, P,\nand K for use in calculating nutrient balances and fertilizer rates for semi-dwarf,\nhigh-yielding irrigated rice cultivars grown in farmers' fields with good\nagronomic practices and balanced use of nutrient inputs. We therefore sought to\n\n\n\n**Fig. 1** Relationship between rice grain yield and accumulation of N, P, and K in\ntotal above-ground dry matter of rice at maturity, using data from NPK\nfertilizer plots (abc) and nutrient omission plots only (def) with harvest\nindex = 0.4 to 0.63 as described in Table 2.

The exclusion of data from omission plots slightly\nincreased RIE obtained from the linear portion of the QUEFTS prediction. With\nthe exclusion of omission plot data, the RIE for nutrients increased from 14.1 to\n14.6 kg N per tonne of grain, 2.6 to 2.7 kg P per tonne of grain, and 15.6 to 15.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\n\nn\ufffd=\ufffdnumber\ufffdof\ufffdobservations\n\nSD\ufffd=\ufffdstandard\ufffddeviation\n\n\n\n356 357\n\n\nkg K per tonne of grain (data not shown). This suggests that the exclusion of\nomission plot data in the QUEFTS analysis is merited because results from\nomission plots tend to concentrate at near the upper boundary line for maximum\ndilution (Fig. 1def).\nThe IEs for maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) and the RIEs\nobtained with QUEFTS in this study were comparable to values reported by Witt\net al. (1999) using a smaller data set (Table 3).At harvest index of 0.4, which is\ncommon for semi-dwarf, high-yielding rice, the RIE of 14.7 reported by Witt et\nal. (1999) remained essentially unchanged at 14.6 kg plant N per tonne of grain,\nand the RIE of 2.6 reported by Witt et al. (1999) remained essentially unchanged\nat 2.7 kg plant P per tonne of grain. The RIE for K increased slightly from 14.5 to\n15.9 kg plant K per tonne of grain (Table 3). The close match between this study\nand Witt et al. (1999) confirms the robustness of the RIEs from Witt et al. (1999)\nthat have been used for a decade to determine fertilizer K and P requirements\nwithin SSNM for rice (Witt et al. 2007).\nNutrient harvest indices are used to determine nutrient balances when\n\nfractions of the crop residues are retained in the field (see equations 5 and 6). The\nmedian nutrient harvest indices obtained from NPK fertilizer plots were 0.63 for\nN, 0.69 for P, and 0.15 for K (Table 4). These values for rice are consistent with\nreports that grain contains about 60% of the N, 15% to 20% of the K, and about\ntwo-thirds of the P accumulated in above-ground biomass (Dobermann and\nFairhurst 2000).\n\n\nNutrient balances in rice-based cropping systems\n\n\n_Continuous rice cropping_\n\n\n\nfor rice to be harvested near ground level with little retention of standing biomass\nin the field.\n\nThe K balances in Fig. 3 with 15% retention of crop residue represent the\nfrequent situation in South Asia where rice is harvested near ground level, and\ncrop residue after threshing is not returned to the field but rather used for\nalternative purposes such as fodder, fuel, or bedding for animals. Under such\nconditions, the crop removal of K increases with increasing grain yield and\nexceeds 100 kg K ha above 7 t ha\ufffd\ufffd. The K balances in Fig. 3 with 40% retention \u20131 \u20131\nof crop residue represent the frequent situation in Southeast Asia, where some\nstanding biomass is retained in the field at harvest, but crop residue after\nthreshing is not returned to the field. Combine harvesting with complete retention\nof crop residue within fields is practiced in some parts of Asia, and it will likely\nincrease in importance, especially where the supply of labor is limited.\n\n\n**Fig. 3** Potassium balances for one rice crop across a range of grain yields as\naffected by amount of crop residue retained (a), addition of 20 kg K ha \u20131\nwith irrigation water (b), and addition of an additional 20 kg K ha from \u20131\norganic materials (c)\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nContinuous rice cultivation with two or three rice crops per year is common\nacross the tropics of Asia. Rice yields in farmers' fields in the tropics can often\nreach 7 to 8 t ha with good agronomic practices in dry seasons with high solar \u20131\nradiation and ample irrigation water. Rice yields in wet seasons typically achieve\nonly 4 to 6 t ha \u20131 with good agronomic practices because of reduced solar\nradiation and reduced yield potential due to cloudiness. The potential depletion of\nsoil K reserves due to removal of crop residues is a concern in intensive rice\ncropping (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000).\nThe net export of K during rice cultivation with complete retention of crop\nresidue is relatively small even at high grain yields, but removal of crop residues\nresults in substantial export of K (Fig. 3a). Rice in Asia is commonly harvested\nmanually, and the harvested biomass is then transported to a central location for\nthreshing. Within Southeast Asia, some standing biomass (i.e., stubble) is\ntypically retained in the field at harvest, but in South Asia it is relatively common\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nThe K balances in Fig. 3 with 100% retention of crop residue represent fields\nwith combine harvesting without subsequent removal of crop residue. They also\nrepresent fields with manual harvesting and complete return of crop residue to the\nfield after threshing. The burning of rice residues, though increasingly banned for\nenvironmental reasons, is still practiced in some locations. Burning of rice\nresidue spread across a field normally does not result in appreciable loss of K\n(Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000); hence, burning of rice residue is neglected as a\nfactor in the determination of K balances in this study.\nThe K balances assume negligible leaching loss in Fig. 3 (K in equation 1). L\nRice soils in Asia are typically tilled at or near saturated soil water content during\nland preparation by a process called puddling, which destroys soil structure and\n\n\n\n358 359\n\n\nreduces percolation rate and leaching loss of ions, including K (Sharma and De\nDatta 1986). My Hoa et al. (2006) reported only 1 to 3 kg K ha loss by leaching \u20131\nduring a growing season on puddled soil in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. The\ninput of K from rainwater by comparison was 6 to 10 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd. Witt and \u20131\nDobermann (2004) estimated 11 kg K ha loss by leaching and 5 kg K ha input \u20131 \u20131\nfrom rainwater in an approximation of K balances for a typical irrigated rice crop\nin Asia. Percolation rate and leaching loss are higher on coarse-textured soil with\nlow cation exchange capacity (Bijay-Singh et al. 2004), but such soils are much\nless common for rice\u2013rice cropping systems. We therefore assume that leaching\nloss of K approximately matched K input from rainwater and could be treated as\nnegligible.\nPhosphorus balances, unlike K balances, in continuous rice cultivation are\nnot strongly affected by management of rice residue (Fig. 4a). Only about onethird of the total P in a mature rice plant typically remains in the crop residue after\nharvest (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000). The retention of crop residue has only a\nsmall effect on net crop removal of P.All crop residue from rice with 7 t ha grain \u20131\nyield contains only about 5 kg P ha\ufffd\ufffd. \u20131\n\n\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nfrom 1.2 to 3.9 mg L\ufffd\ufffd.

The input of K with irrigation water depends on both the K\nconcentration in added water and the quantity of water added during the entire\ncropping cycle in rice production from the onset of land preparation to harvest.\nThe concentration of K in irrigation water, as shown in Table 7, varies within and\namong rice-growing areas.

About 1300 to 1500 mm is a general\nvalue for irrigated rice in Asia (Bouman and Tuong 2001; Bouman et al. 2006).\nRainfall can differ markedly between growing seasons in Asian rice production\nareas with two or three rice crops per year. During monsoonal wet seasons, much\nof the required water can be provided through rainfall. Some irrigated rice areas\ndo not even receive irrigation in the wet season. In the dry season, on the other\nhand, much of the water must be supplied through irrigation.\nWe assume an addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water during one cropping\ncycle. The addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water with 1.8 mg K L, the median \u20131\nK concentration in Table 7, would add 18 kg K ha\ufffd\ufffd. This input of K would \u20131\nincrease with increased use of irrigation water, and it would decrease as rainfall\ncontributed a greater portion of the total required water.\nThe variability in K concentration of irrigation water leads to uncertainty in\nthe input of K for a specific rice field. Results for the two locations in the\nPhilippines in Table 7 illustrate substantial variation in K concentration among\nlocations within a country. The K concentration in irrigation water ranged from\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n360 361\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n0.3 to 1.5 mg L for 13 samples from Bohol and from 2.0 to 6.1 mg L for 22\nsamples from Iloilo (data not shown). The K concentration for 50% of the\nsamples was 1.2 to 1.4 mg L in Bohol and 3.3 to 4.2 mg L in Iloilo. Assuming \u20131 \u20131\nan addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water, K input for 50% of the rice fields\nwould be 12 to 14 kg K ha in the sample area in Bohol and 33 to 42 kg K ha in \u20131 \u20131\nthe sample area in Iloilo. The K inputs for the remaining 50% of rice fields would\nfall outside these ranges. The deficit in K balances, and consequently the amount\nof fertilizer K needed to maintain a non-negative K balance, would differ by\nabout 20 to 30 kg K ha between Bohol and Iloilo at comparable rice yields and \u20131\nfractions of retained rice residue.\n\nResults in Table 7 also illustrate substantial variability in K concentration of\nirrigation water within a rice-growing area. In the case of the Cauvery Delta in\nIndia, the K concentration in irrigation water for 24 samples ranged from 1.0 to\n9.5 mg L (data not shown), and 50% of the samples fell within 1.3 to 3.0 mg L\ufffd\ufffd. \u20131 \u20131\nAssuming an addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water, K input for rice fields\nwould range from 10 to 95 kg ha \u20131 in the sample area with 50% of the fields\nreceiving 13 to 30 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd. This variability within a rice-growing area highlights \u20131\nthe importance of information on K inputs from irrigation water when\ndetermining field-specific fertilizer K rates based on K balances.\nThe K balances in Fig. 3b assume input of 20 kg K ha from irrigation water, \u20131\nwhich, based on results in Table 7, appears likely for irrigated rice in seasons with\nlimited rainfall. Complete retention of crop residue with such input of K from\nirrigation water results in near neutral K balances even at high rice yields. This\nsuggests that K deficiency is unlikely in continuous cultivation of irrigated rice\nwith continual retention of all rice residue, use of irrigation water containing 2\nmg K L\ufffd\ufffd, and negligible K loss by leaching. \u20131\nIrrigation water normally contains negligible P. The P concentration in\nirrigation water samples reported in Table 7 was consistently <0.1 mg L (data \u20131\nnot shown). Irrigation water is consequently not considered a source of\nsignificant P in rice\u2013rice cropping systems.\nIntegrated use of organic materials with manufactured chemical fertilizers is\nrecommended in some rice-growing areas (Mamaril et al. 2009). Organic\nmaterials such as composted animal manure and green manures contain K (Witt\net al. 2007; Mamaril et al. 2009), which contribute to K balances and the supply\nof plant-available K to rice crops. The K balances in Fig. 3c assume input of 20 kg\nK ha \u20131 from organic material, corresponding to 2 t ha \u20131 with 10 g K kg\ufffd\ufffd, in \u20131\naddition to 20 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water. The K deficits and hence likely\nneed for fertilizer K are greatest at high rice yields, especially when little or no\ncrop residue is retained.\nOrganic materials at common levels of availability and application are\nunlikely to eliminate deficits in K balances at relatively high rice yields when\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\ncrop residue is only partially retained. But, at lower rice yields such as <5 t ha\ufffd\ufffd,\nwhich are common for wet seasons, the application of organic materials with\npartial retention of crop residues can result in near neutral K balances (Fig. 3c).\nWhen all crop residue is retained, the application of organic materials can result\nin positive K balances across all rice yields (Fig. 3c).\nThe P from added organic materials can have a marked effect on P balances.\nThe input of 10 kg P ha from organic material, corresponding to 2 t ha with 5 g \u20131 \u20131\nP kg\ufffd\ufffd, can eliminate deficits in P balances at rice yields of <5 t ha \u20131 \u20131 (Fig. 4b).\nOrganic P in added organic materials must be converted to phosphate during\ndecomposition of the organic material to become plant available. As a result of\nthis delayed release of plant-available P from organic materials, a relatively\nsmaller fraction of added P from organic material than from manufactured\nchemical fertilizer would likely be taken up by rice in the season when P is\napplied.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n_Rice\u2013wheat system_\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nThe rice\u2013wheat cropping system is common in the subtropics of South Asia and\nChina. It is the main cereal system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South\nAsia, where it is practiced on 13.5 million ha across Bangladesh, India, Nepal,\nand Pakistan. In the northwestern part of the IGP, the rice\u2013wheat system is highly\nintensive with liberal and often excessive use of irrigation water. There are\nincreasing concerns regarding the sustainability of the system in the northwestern\nIGP due to low use-efficiency of inputs, including fertilizers, depletion of\nirrigation water, and degradation of soil resources (Ladha et al. 2009).\nIn Northwest India, within the northwestern part of the IGP, the groundwater\nused for irrigation of rice\u2013wheat is relatively high in K. Reported K\nconcentrations for 242 samples from tube wells in the central plain region of the\nstate of Punjab in Northwest India ranged from 0.87 to 38.2 mg L with a mean of \u20131\n5.1 mg L \u20131 (Pasricha et al. 2001). This corresponded to an estimated input of\nabout 80 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water for a rice\u2013wheat system. Canal water\nfrom gravity-fed irrigation is relatively lower in K content than water from tube\nwells. Because some farmers use water from both sources during a rice\u2013wheat\ncropping cycle (Erenstein 2009), the input of K with irrigation water depends on\nsource as well as the amount of added water.\n\nSoils for rice\u2013wheat cropping in the northwestern IGP are light textured with\nrapid loss of water by percolation. An abundance of electric and diesel tube wells\nhas enabled considerable extraction of groundwater for rice\u2013wheat production\n(Erenstein 2009). A survey of farmers at sites in Haryana, India and Punjab,\nPakistan revealed use of about 1600 to 1900 mm irrigation water during one rice\nproduction cycle (Erenstein 2009). Much less irrigation water, approximating\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n362 363\n\n\n200 to 300 mm, is used for wheat production (Khurana et al. 2008; Erenstein\n2009). Use for one rice\u2013wheat cropping cycle of an estimated 2000 mm irrigation\nwater originating from a tube-well with 5.1 mg K L would result in input of 102 \u20131\nkg K ha from tube well irrigation. This matches with an estimated 100 kg K ha \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\u20131\n\nyr from irrigation water reported in a long-term rice\u2013wheat experiment at\nLudhiana, Punjab, by Bijay-Singh et al. (2004) in a review of literature. A\nfraction of the added K would likely be lost from the crop rooting zone through\nleaching. An annual input of 75 kg K ha from irrigation water is therefore used \u20131\nin Fig. 5 as a plausible net K input for a typical rice\u2013wheat cropping system in\nNorthwest India.\n\nSoil K in addition to K from irrigation water can be lost by leaching.\nLeaching loss of soil K can be an important output in K balances on soils with\nrelatively high release of K from nonexchangeable pools and minerals, leading to\nhigh concentrations of K in soil solution lost by percolation (Haefele 2001).\nBijay-Singh et al. (2004), in a review of literature, estimated an annual K\nleaching loss of 19 to 31 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, depending on inputs of K, from a rice\u2013wheat \u20131\nsystem on light-textured soil in Punjab. The estimated annual K input from\nrainwater was 5 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd. Annual leaching loss of 20 kg K ha is therefore used in \u20131 \u20131\nFig. 5 to approximate total leaching loss of soil K minus the small input of K from\nrainwater.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nplausible high net input of K with irrigation water. The low net K input of 25 kg\nha in Fig. 5 represents the use of water-saving technology leading to substantial \u20131\nsavings in total water use, enabling the use of primarily canal water rather than\ntube-well water for irrigation.\nWheat residue is often removed from the field for use as fodder in Northwest\n\nIndia, whereas rice residue is less valuable for fodder and is often partially or\ncompletely retained in the field (Mandal et al. 2004). The K balances in Fig. 5a\nwith 15% retention of both rice and wheat residue represent removal of all aboveground crop biomass except for small standing biomass near ground level. Under\nsuch conditions, K balances are negative across all rice grain yields even with\nhigh input of K from irrigation water.\nThe K balances in Fig. 5b with 15% retention of wheat residue and 100%\nretention of rice residue represent a relatively common situation with removal of\nwheat residue but complete retention of rice residue such as after combine\nharvesting. Under such conditions, the K balance is near neutral across all rice\ngrain yields with net input of 125 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water. Annual K\nbalances are somewhat negative (\u201350 to \u201360 kg K ha\ufffd\ufffd) with a plausible common \u20131\nnet input of 75 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water. Soils in this region have an\ninherent capacity to release K (Bijay-Singh et al. 2004). The retention of some\ncrop residue, use of relatively large amounts of irrigation water from tube wells,\nand net release of K from soil reserves could contribute to the commonly\nobserved absence of crop response to applied K (Khurana et al. 2008). The\nburning of rice residue would likely not have much effect on the K balances\nbecause residue spread across a field normally does not result in appreciable loss\nof K (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000).\nThe use of water-saving technologies that markedly reduce K inputs from\nirrigation (e.g., input = 25 kg K ha in Fig. 5b) would result in more negative K \u20131\nbalances, suggesting that water-saving technologies could increase the likelihood\nof K deficiency even when rice residue is retained. Water-saving technologies\ncould be combined with retention of wheat residue (Fig. 5c) or use of fertilizer K\nto compensate for reduced input of K from irrigation water. The value of wheat\nresidue for fodder and uses other than a supply of K would need to be assessed\nrelative to the cost of fertilizer K to determine the potential attractiveness of\nwheat residue as a source of K. Our analysis suggests that variation in irrigation\nand residue management among fields can strongly affect K balances, which\ncould have a considerable effect on the estimation of field-specific fertilizer K\nrates in the rice\u2013wheat system.\nThe P balances in the rice\u2013wheat system are consistently negative regardless\nof the quantity of retained crop residue (Fig. 6). The retention of crop residue\nhas less effect on P than K balances because a much smaller fraction of the plant\nP than K remains in crop residue after harvest. The net removal of P in one\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n**Fig. 5**\n\n\n\nPotassium balances for one rice\u2013wheat cropping cycle in Northwest India\nacross a range of rice grain yields as affected by net input of K with\nirrigation water and amount of crop residue retained. Wheat grain yield is\n5 t ha in all cases \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nAs reported by Pasricha et al. (2001), K concentrations in tube-well water\ncan be markedly higher than 5 mg L\ufffd\ufffd. Assuming an application of 1800 mm of \u20131\nwater with 10 mg K L and leaching loss of about 30% of the added K, this would \u20131\nresult in a net input of about 125 kg K ha\ufffd\ufffd, which is included in Fig. 5 as a \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n364 365\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\ncropping cycle with 5 t ha wheat grain yield and 7 t ha rice grain yield is about\n30 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd. This matches closely with results of on-station research at Ludhiana, \u20131\nPunjab, that led to recommended application of 26 kg P ha \u20131 to wheat that\nresponds to P and no application of P to rice that typically does not respond to P\n(Gupta et al. 2007).\n\n\n\n**Fig. 7** Potassium and phosphorus balances for one rice\u2013maize cropping cycle\nacross a range of rice grain yields as affected by maize yield.

Rice is a well-adapted crop in lowlands in the wet season,\nbut maize can replace rice in the drier or cooler season, especially when\nmarketing opportunities are attractive for maize or irrigation water is limited for\nrice production (Ali et al. 2008).\nThe nutrient balances for one rice\u2013maize cycle in Fig. 7 represent common\nmanagement for a rice\u2013maize system with removal of nearly all above-ground\nbiomass (residue retention = 15%) and retention of some standing rice biomass\nafter harvest (residue retention = 40%). Maize residue is typically not retained\nbecause it is difficult to incorporate during tillage for rice production and the\nincorporated residue with its high C-to-N ratio can lead to immobilization of N\nduring decomposition. The K input from irrigation water is assumed to be only 25\nkg ha because the rice\u2013maize system, unlike rice\u2013wheat in Northwest India, is \u20131\nnot common in areas with high application to rice of tube-well water high in K.\nLeaching loss of K is assumed to be negligible.\n\n\n\nNutrient balances for the rice\u2013maize system are strongly affected by the\nyield of maize (Fig. 7). Hybrid maize in a rice\u2013maize system can achieve a yield\nup to 12 t ha \u20131 with good management practices and a sufficient supply of\nnutrients in farmers' fields (IPNI, unpublished data), which is markedly higher\nthan the achievable yield for either rice or wheat in the same season. At 12 t ha \u20131\nmaize grain, there is a net export of about 200 kg K ha and 40 kg P ha for one \u20131 \u20131\nrice\u2013maize cropping cycle with common residue management practices and\nproduction of 5 t ha rice grain (Fig. 7). The rice\u2013maize system with high maize \u20131\nyield is more extractive of nutrients than rice\u2013rice and rice\u2013wheat systems.\nThe retention of maize residues can markedly reduce the net export from a\nrice\u2013maize cropping system of K but not P (Fig. 8). In the rice\u2013maize cropping\nsystem, rice is typically grown in the wet season when rice yield is often lower\nthan in the dry season. The nutrient balances in Fig. 8 consequently assume a rice\nyield of only 5 t ha \u20131 in the wet season. Retention of maize residues markedly\nreduces but does not eliminate the deficit in K balances when rice residue is not\n\nretained (Fig. 8a). Retention of all maize and rice residues is required to achieve\nnear-neutral K balances (Fig. 8b).\nRetention of rice residues is feasible through either combine harvesting or\nmanual harvesting with retention of standing biomass. Retention of maize\nresidue is problematic because it increases the energy required for tillage before\nrice. Incorporation of maize residue due to its high C-to-N ratio can also have\nshort-term negative effects on N availability to rice due to N immobilization\n(Buresh et al. 2008).

Rice grain yield was 5 t ha in all cases, and K input \u20131\nfrom irrigation water during the cropping cycle was 25 kg ha \u20131\n\n\n\nDetermination of fertilizer K and P rates\n\n\n_Yield gain approach_\n\n\nResults from over 500 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted with irrigated\nrice in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam (Table 1) are presented in Fig.\n9 to provide an example of yield gains attainable for rice from K and P\nfertilization in Asia. Grain yields without K or without P increased in direct\nproportion to yields with full fertilization throughout the range in yields from 3 to\n9 t ha\ufffd\ufffd. Yield gains expressed as a fraction of the yield with full fertilization \u20131\naveraged 12% (slope = 0.88) for K and 9% (slope = 0.91) for P.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n**Fig. 9**\n\n\n\nRelationship between rice grain yields in a plot with full fertilization of\nample N, P, and K and an adjacent plot without application of K or P but\nsufficient amounts of other nutrients to prevent their limitations. Data are\nfrom trials conducted in farmers' fields in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,\nand Vietnam\n\n\n\nrather than tillage to incorporate maize residue, such as through direct dry\nseeding, might provide an alternative to facilitate retention of maize residues in\nthe rice\u2013maize system. In the absence of technologies to facilitate retention of\nmaize residue, higher K deficits and hence higher fertilizer K requirements are\nlikely for the rice\u2013maize system with high-yielding hybrid maize than for the\nrice\u2013rice or rice\u2013wheat system.\nThe P balances are affected more by maize yield than by management of\nmaize and rice residues. The P deficits and hence likely need for fertilizer P\nincrease in direct proportion to the yield of maize (Fig. 8cd).\n\n\n\nIn the yield gain approach for determining fertilizer K and P requirements,\nfertilizer K and P are applied only when a crop response to the nutrient is certain.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, the yield gain for irrigated rice from added K or P is often\nrelatively small to moderate, averaging near 10%. We therefore present yield gains\nof 5%, 10% and 20% in an illustration of fertilizer K and P rates and balances\nacross the feasible range of irrigated rice yields from 3 to 9 t ha (Fig. 10). \u20131\nFertilizer K and P rates were determined using equations 7 and 8 in which\nyield gain (GY \u2013 GY ) at a targeted yield with full fertilization (GY) was 0\ndetermined as the respective fraction (5%, 10%, or 20%) of GY. We used RIEs for\nK (15.9) and P (2.7) as determined by QUEFTS (Table 3) and recovery efficiencies\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n368 369\n\n\n**Fig. 10** Fertilizer K and P rates for rice determined with a yield gain approach\nbased on anticipated yield gain from K or P fertilization, expressed as a\npercentage of the attainable yield with full balanced fertilization. In each\ncase 40% of rice residue was retained in the field, and K input from\nirrigation water during the cropping cycle was 20 kg ha \u20131\n\n\n\nK P\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n0K K\n\n\n\n0P P\n\n\n\nof K (RE = 0.64) and P (RE = 0.3) that correspond to about the 70% quartile for K P\nvalues obtained by Witt and Dobermann (2004) from a large data set for irrigated\nrice in Asia. Fertilizer requirements corresponded to 25 kg K ha and 9 kg P ha to \u20131 \u20131\nraise the respective nutrient-limited yield by 1 t ha . In the estimation of K and P \u20131\nbalances in Fig. 10, we assumed 40% retention of rice residue (CRR = 0.4 in\nequations 5 and 6) and 20 kg K ha \u20131 net input from irrigation water, which\napproximates a likely median value for dry-season rice among sites shown in Table\n7. Leaching loss of K is assumed to be negligible.\nFertilizer K and P requirements determined by the yield gain approach\n(equations 7 and 8) increased with increasing target yield (Fig. 10ac), but the K\nand P rates did not increase sufficiently fast to prevent increasing depletion of soil\n\n\n\nfertility with increasing yield within the ranges of yield gain common for\nirrigated rice (Fig. 10bd). The same trends of increasing fertilizer rates and\ndecreasing nutrient balances with increasing yield occur when lower recovery\nefficiencies (RE K = 0.35 and RE = 0.22) corresponding to median values P\nreported by Witt and Dobermann (2004) were used to determine fertilizer\nrequirements (data not shown).\nA distinctly undesirable feature of fertilizer K and P rates determined by the\nyield gain approach is higher K and P depletion at high than low target yields.\nThis could accelerate the onset of nutrient limitations and subsequent declines in\nproductivity in existing high-yielding areas. For both K and P, the slope for\nestimated nutrient balances with increasing yield became less negative as yield\ngain increased from 5% to 20%. Yield gains >20%, which are not common for\nirrigated rice (Fig. 9), would be required to obtain slope = 0 (Fig. 10), at which\npoint nutrient depletion would be constant across yields.\nAlthough Fig. 10 presents results for rice, the same trends would apply to\nwheat and maize. Cereal-growing areas with high-yielding crops and relatively\nsmall current yield gain from K and P fertilization \u2014 and hence low fertilizer K\nand P recommendations based on a yield gain approach \u2014 would be particularly\nprone to nutrient mining and risk of declining productivity. For K, because of the\nlarge portion of total plant K in crop residues, the risk would be greater in highyielding fields with removal than with retention of crop residues. Locations with\nexisting large yield gains from K and P fertilization would be relatively less at\nrisk of further K and P mining from fertilizer K and P recommendations based\nsolely on a yield gain approach.\nThe determination of fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) (in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd) required \u20131\nto achieve a targeted yield (GY, expressed in t ha\ufffd\ufffd) by the yield gain approach can \u20131\nbe simplified by replacing RIE/RE in equations 7 and 8 with a target agronomic\nefficiency (AE) for the nutrient:\nFK = (GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE 0K K [19]\nFP = (GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE 0P P [20]\nwhere agronomic efficiency of the applied nutrient (AE or AE ) is expressed as K P\nkg increase in grain yield per kgapplied nutrient. The determination with SSNM\nof fertilizer N requirements uses a comparable yield gain approach with\nagronomic efficiency (Witt et al. 2007). The target fertilizer requirements of 25\nkg K and 9 kg P to raise the respective nutrient-limited yield by 1 t ha \u20131\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\ncorrespond to AE = 40 kg kg and AE = 110 kg kg\ufffd\ufffd. This AE is derived from a K P P\ndata set without P-fixing soils, and it would likely be lower for soils with high\ncapacity to fix P.\n\n\n\n_Nutrient maintenance based on nutrient balance approach_\n\n\nThe nutrient balance approach based on full or partial maintenance of nutrient\n\n\n\nK P\n\n\n\nK P\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nK P P\n\n\n\n370 371\n\n\ninput-output balances provides an alternative to the yield gain approach for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P requirements. With full maintenance (FM = 1 in\nequations 11 and 12), the fertilizer K or P rates match removal of K or P, ensuring\nno nutrient depletion (depletion = 0 in Fig. 11). Full maintenance rates of a\nnutrient fail to consider enhanced nutrient availability from soil biological,\nchemical, and physical processes. They can also result in short-term financial loss\nfor farmers when the yield gain resulting from application of the nutrient is\nnegligible or small. But, failure to apply the nutrient leads to nutrient depletion,\nwhich might eventually lead to yield loss. Application of fertilizer K and P at less\nthan full (i.e., partial) maintenance rates could then provide an opportunity to\nconsider the supply of nutrient from soil reserves, including contributions from\nbiological processes, and better handle the tradeoffs between longer-term\n\n\n**Fig. 11** Fertilizer K and P rates for rice determined with a nutrient balance\napproach allowing three contrasting amounts for K and P depletion. In\neach case 40% of rice residue was retained in the field, and K input from\nirrigation water during the cropping cycle was 20 kg ha \u20131\n\n\n\nsustained productivity and short-term financial benefit.\nOne option for determining fertilizer rates at partial maintenance is to allow a\ndrawdown or depletion of soil nutrient reserves equivalent to a fraction of the\nnutrient required for full maintenance of the nutrient input-output balance. This\noption, which we refer to as fractional depletion, is illustrated in Fig. 11 for\nfertilizer K and P rates determined at 50% of full maintenance (depletion = 50%;\nFM = 0.5 in equations 11 and 12). Fertilizer rates increased with increasing target\nyield (Fig. 11ac), but the K and P rates did not increase sufficiently fast to prevent\nincreasing depletion of soil K and P with increasing yield (Fig. 11bd). Nutrient\ndepletion and risk of declining productivity are higher at high than low target\nyields with this option of partial maintenance.\nAnother option for determining fertilizer rates at partial maintenance is to\nallow depletion of a nutrient up to but not beyond a threshold limit (K and P in S S\nequations 13 and 14). In this option, which we refer to as limited depletion, the\nthreshold limit represents the estimated drawdown of soil nutrient reserves that\ncould be sustained without leading to more nutrient limitations on crop yield. The\nallowable drawdown of soil nutrient reserves (FM in fractional depletion option\nand K and P in limited depletion option) could depend upon soil processes like S S\nsoil biological activity as affected by water regime (Turner and Haygarth 2001)\nand tillage (Lorenz et al. 2009), equilibrium among nutrient pools (Singh at el.\n2002; Saleque et al. 2009), and soil characteristics like mineralogy (Bijay-Singh\net al. 2004). Fig. 11 illustrates conditions in which the limits for drawdown of soil\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\nnutrient reserves were 30 kg K ha (K ) and 8 kg P ha S (P ). Rice residue S\nretention was 40%, net K input from irrigation water was 20 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, and leaching \u20131\nloss of K was negligible.\nWith the limited depletion option, fertilizer rates (Fig. 11ac) are calculated\nsuch that nutrient balances (Fig. 11bd) are never more negative than the limit for\ndrawdown of soil nutrient reserves (K S and P ). No fertilizer K or P is S\nrecommended at low yields (Fig. 11bd). Fertilizer K or P is recommended only\nabove the yield at which the net output of the nutrient in the nutrient balance\nexceeds K or P (equations 13 and 14). The relatively comparable level of S S\nnutrient depletion across yields and the absence of increasing nutrient depletion\nat high yields make the limited depletion option for partial maintenance\n(equations 13 and 14) more attractive than the fractional depletion option\n(equations 11 and 12) for determining fertilizer K and P across environments with\nwidely varying yields.\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n_Partial maintenance plus yield gain approach_\n\n\nUse of the partial maintenance approach to determine fertilizer requirements\nrisks applying insufficient nutrient to meet crop needs when yield gain to the\n\n\n372 373\n\n\nadded nutrient is large, but use of the yield gain approach by itself can result in\nnutrient depletion at high yields (Fig. 10bd). A combination of the two\napproaches was therefore examined for determining fertilizer requirements when\nyield gain from added nutrient is certain.\nIn Fig. 12 the fertilizer K and P rates and balances for a partial maintenance\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\napproach with limited depletion (K = 30 kg K ha and P = 8 kg P ha\ufffd\ufffd) are S S\ncompared alone (equations 13 and 14) and in combination with a yield gain\napproach (equations 17 and 18). Yield gain was either set at 20% of attainable\n\n\n\u20131\n\nyield (GY \u2013 GY = 0.2GY) or at a constant 1 t ha (GY \u2013 GY = 1). In Fig. 13 the 0 0\n\n\n**Fig. 12** Fertilizer K and P rates for rice determined with a partial maintenance\nplus yield gain approach in which maximum K and P depletion does not\nexceed a threshold limit from the soil nutrient reserves.

As in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, rice residue retention was 40%, net K input from \u20131\nirrigation water was 20 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, and leaching loss of K was negligible. \u20131\nFertilizer rates were lowest when determined with only a partial maintenance\napproach (Fig. 12ac and 13ac). Combining partial maintenance with a yield gain\napproach resulted in higher calculated fertilizer rates and more positive K and P\nbalances (Fig. 12bd and 13bd). Fertilizer rates with a partial maintenance plus\nyield gain approach increased faster with increasing yield when yield gain was\nexpressed as a fraction of attainable yield (i.e., 20%) rather than as a fixed amount\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n374 375\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n(i.e., 1 t ha\ufffd\ufffd). The K and P balances as a result were more positive at higher yields\nwhen yield gain was expressed as a fraction of attainable yield (i.e., 20%).\nBased on results from nutrient omission plot studies (Fig. 9), the yield gain of\nrice from K and P fertilization is directly related to the attainable yield with full\nfertilization. Yield gain is consequently better represented across a wide range of\nyields as a fraction of the attainable yield (i.e., 20% in Fig. 12 and 13) rather than\na fixed amount (i.e., 1 t ha\ufffd\ufffd). Based on data in Fig. 9, for example, at 5 t ha \u20131 \u20131\nattainable yield with full fertilization, the mean yield gain was 0.6 t ha \u20131 for K\napplication and 0.5 t ha \u20131 for P application; at 8 t ha \u20131 attainable yield with full\nfertilization, the mean yield gain was 1.0 t ha for K application and 0.7 t ha for \u20131 \u20131\nP application.\nThe results suggest that at low rice yields when the yield gain from applied K\nor P is relatively small such as 0.5 t ha\ufffd\ufffd, which often corresponds to yields of \u20131\n<5 t ha \u20131 (Fig. 9), fertilizer requirements can be determined with only a partial\nmaintenance approach (Fig. 11). When yield gain is more pronounced, a partial\nmaintenance plus yield gain approach can be considered for determining\nfertilizer requirements (Fig. 12 and 13). Expressing yield gain as a fraction of\ntargeted yield helps ensure a good fit with measured yield gains (Fig. 9), and it\nhelps ensure that the input of nutrient at higher yields is relatively higher and\nsufficient to overcome nutrient deficiencies.\n\nThe determination of fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) by a partial\nmaintenance plus yield gain approach can be simplified by replacing RIE/RE in\nequations 15 to 18 with a target agronomic efficiency (AE) of the nutrient.\nEquations 15 and 16 for the fractional depletion option become:\nFK = ((GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K ) x FM) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) [21] L 0K K\nFP = ((GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM ) x FM) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) 0P P [22]\nEquations 17 and 18 for the limited depletion option become:\nFK = (GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM \u2013 K + K ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) [23] S L 0K K\nFP = (GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM \u2013 P ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) S 0P P [24]\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nof soil processes and soil characteristics mediating K and P supply when yield\ngain from the applied nutrient is uncertain. The use of nutrient balances across a\nfull range of plausible yields enables fertilizer K and P requirements to be\nadjusted for field-specific yield and management, such as amounts of retained\ncrop residue and applied organic materials, which affect inputs and outputs of K\nand P.\n\nThe SSNM-based approach for determining fertilizer requirements is well\nsuited for small, heterogeneous landholdings typical of rice-based cropping\nsystems in Asia where fertilizer requirements can vary greatly among nearby\nfields and the yield gain from applied K or P is often uncertain. Nutrient balances\ncan provide a pragmatic estimate of nutrient inputs and outputs for a field plot,\nwhich can then be used for determining fertilizer K and P requirements for the\nspecific field. Numerous practices including tillage, management of crop\nresidues and organic materials, and water management can influence soil\nbiological activity and nutrient availability. Their net effect on K and P supply can\nbe considered through K and P in partial nutrient balances (equations 13, 14, 23, S S\nand 24). Research is needed to quantify the net effect of soil processes and soil\ncharacteristics on the sustainable drawdown of soil K and P reserves (K and P ) S S\nused in the determination of fertilizer K and P requirements.\nWhereas nutrient balances are essential for determining SSNM-based\nfertilizer K and P requirements, nutrient balances are not used for determining\nSSNM-based fertilizer N requirements. With SSNM, fertilizer N requirements\nare based on the yield gain from applied N (Witt et al. 2007) because rice and\nother cereal crops in irrigated environments virtually always respond to fertilizer\nN. The SSNM-based approach enables yield gain from applied fertilizer N, and\nhence total fertilizer N requirement, to be adjusted for management practices. It\nalso provides decision tools such as the leaf color chart for dynamically adjusting\nthe application of N during the growing season to match crop needs for\nsupplemental N (Alam et al. 2005), which can be influenced by the effects of\nmanagement on availability of soil N.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nK CR W OM L 0K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM 0P P\n\n\n\nK CR W OM S L 0K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM S 0P P\n\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nThe SSNM-based approach and algorithms we present for determining fertilizer\nK and P requirements provide an alternative to soil-test approaches (Slaton et al.\n2009) that use algorithms derived from fertilizer response trials conducted across\nmultiple locations. The SSNM-based approach through the use of nutrient\nbalances enables the determination of fertilizer K and P requirements when the\nyield gain from the applied nutrient is negligible or uncertain (Witt and\nDobermann 2004; Witt et al. 2007), which periodically occurs for irrigated rice\nespecially at lower yields (Fig. 9). In this paper we revise the SSNM-based\napproach to accommodate partial nutrient balances, which consider the net effect\n\n\n\nInternal nutrient efficiencies for rice\n\n\nField-specific requirements of a cereal crop for fertilizer K and P can be\ncalculated using RIE to estimate nutrient accumulation by a crop (Witt and\nDobermann 2004). The RIE values obtained for rice in our study using QUEFTS\nmatched well with RIE values reported by others (Witt et al. 1999; Haefele et al.\n2003) for rice with harvest index 0.4, grown with balanced fertilization and\ngood agronomic management. This consistency in RIE across diverse irrigated\nrice-growing environments and cultivars provides confidence that one RIE per\nnutrient can be used for semi-dwarf irrigated rice in determining fertilizer P and\n\n\n\n376 377\n\n\nK requirements when fertilization is balanced to match crop needs.\nDeviations in RIE from the estimation with QUEFTS arise from unbalanced\nplant nutrition leading to either nutrient accumulation associated with luxuriant\nuptake of the nutrient or nutrient dilution associated with nutrient deficiency.\nDeviations in RIE can also arise from biotic or abiotic stresses that adversely\naffect grain production leading to low harvest index. The desired RIE value for\nuse in determining fertilizer P and K requirements reflects an optimal\naccumulation of the nutrients in a mature crop without biotic and abiotic stress.\nThe RIE increases slightly as targeted yield increases above 60% to 70%\nyield potential, which is common in farmers' fields, to 80% of yield potential,\nwhich represents a likely upper limit to profitable rice production (Table 6). But\nthis change in RIE is relatively small ( 7%) compared to other inherent\nuncertainties associated with the determination of fertilizer rates such as\n\nestimation of the attainable yield, yield gain, and some components of the\nnutrient balance such as K addition from irrigation water. The use of RIE at 60%\nto 70% of yield potential therefore appears appropriate for determing fertilizer\nrequirements for irrigated rice.\nSemi-dwarf, high-yielding irrigated rice without biotic or abiotic stresses has\nharvest index 0.4, which was the lower limit of harvest index used by Witt et al.\n(1999), Haefele et al. (2003), and our study. We propose that 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P,\nand 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain (Table 3) and nutrient harvest indices of HI = K\n0.15 and HI = 0.7 (Table 4) obtained from a large data set in our study and P\ncomparable to values reported by others (Witt et al. 1999, Haefele et al. 2003) can\nserve as standards for use in determining nutrient balances and associated P and\nK fertilizer rates with semi-dwarf, high-yielding irrigated rice grown with good\nagronomic practices and sufficient water. Alternative RIE values would be\nrequired for rice cultivars with harvest index <0.4 (Table 5).\nSome rice in rainfed areas can have harvest index <0.4 and corresponding\nincreased accumulation of plant nutrient in above-ground dry matter per tonne\ngrain yield. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2008), for example, in a fertilizer trial with\nrainfed rice in West Bengal in eastern India, reported mean harvest index = 0.32\nand mean accumulation of 33 kg K and 4.3 kg P per tonne of grain. In a multilocation trial in Thailand with 624 observations for traditional tall rice cultivars,\nNaklang et al. (2006) reported median harvest index = 0.28 and median plant\naccumulation of 48 kg K and 4.7 kg P per tonne of grain. In both studies the rice\nyields were relatively low (<4 t ha\ufffd\ufffd). The higher RIE reported for traditional-type \u20131\nrice by Naklang et al. (2006) than found for semi-dwarf modern rice such as in\nWitt et al. (1999) and our study resulted from differences in harvest index rather\nthan differences in tissue concentration of nutrients between the two types of rice.\nThe RIE estimated from the mean or median of a data set (Table 2) tends to\nbe higher than the RIE estimated from the linear portion of the QUEFTS model\n\n\n\n(Table 3), which reflects a more balanced uptake of nutrient by the crop. We\ntherefore recommend use of the QUEFTS model with a relatively large data set\nfrom across rice-growing areas to estimate RIE for rice cultivars with harvest\nindex <0.4. The estimated RIE for K and P can then be used in calculating\nnutrient balances and fertilizer rates for rice cultivars \u2014 for a given range in\nharvest index \u2014 grown with balanced use of nutrient inputs and good agronomic\npractices. Data from crop-growing situations with either luxuriant uptake of\nnutrients, such as arising from excessive fertilization, or nutrient deficiency are\ntherefore preferably omitted from the data set used with QUEFTS.\n\n\nNutrient balances in rice-based cropping systems\n\n\nPotassium balances in rice-based systems are strongly affected by the attained\ncrop yield and fraction of crop residue retained, which can vary from field to\nfield. An immediate opportunity for improving the profitability and effectiveness\nof fertilizer K use is consequently to enable field-specific adjustments in fertilizer\nK rates based on probable yield and fraction of crop residue retained in a specific\nfield. Fertilizer K rates for a field could then be further adjusted based on the use\nof externally produced organic materials. Whereas organic materials are often\npromoted for their N benefit, the K inputs from organic materials can be\noverlooked. From the perspective of K balances and maintenance of soil K\nfertility, the application of organic materials to rice is more warranted when crop\nresidues are removed rather than retained. Full retention of rice residue with the\n\napplication of organic materials can potentially result in positive K balances (Fig.\n3c).\nIrrigation water can be an unknown but important input of K in rice\nproduction because of the large quantity of water applied to rice. Uncertainties\nassociated with K concentration in irrigation water and quantity of added\nirrigation water, which can vary from field to field, present a challenge for\nimproving K management and adjusting fertilizer K rates for field-specific\nconditions. The K concentration in irrigation water depends on the source of the\nwater. It is often higher in water from tube wells than from canals in gravity-fed\nirrigation systems (Pasricha et al. 2001), but it can vary among gravity-fed\nirrigation systems as illustrated by the contrast between Bohol and Iloilo in the\nPhilippines (Table 7).\nThe adjustment of fertilizer K requirements to field-specific yields and\nresidue retention can be relatively straightforward because farmers know their\nfield-specific yields and residue management practices. The K input through\nirrigation water, on the other hand, will not be known to farmers. An adjustment\nin fertilizer K requirements for inputs from irrigation water would likely need to\nbe made across a region rather than for a specific field. One option could be to\nestimate, across an entire gravity-fed irrigation system or across all tube wells in\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n378 379\n\n\na region, a probable net K input based on approximate K concentration of the\nwater and typical amount of irrigation water used in a cropping season. This\nestimated probable K input could then be used to adjust nutrient balance-based K\nfertilizer rates across fields for the irrigation system or region. Although such an\nadjustment in fertilizer K rates would undoubtedly contain much uncertainty, it\nwould be superior to the current situation in which net K input from irrigation\nwater is either ignored or assumed to be constant across a country.\nPhosphorus balances in rice and rice-based systems are strongly affected by\nattained crop yield. Residue retention has relatively little effect on P balances and\nhence fertilizer P requirements determined through nutrient balances because of\nthe relatively low P content of residue compared with grain. An immediate\nopportunity for improving the profitability and effectiveness of fertilizer P use is\nconsequently to enable field-specific adjustments in fertilizer P rates based on\nprobable yields.\nFertilizer P rates at the field level could then be further adjusted based on the\nuse of organic materials, which, when relatively rich in P, can contribute to P\nbalances (Fig. 4). Uncertainty exists regarding P supply from organic materials\nbecause organic materials can vary greatly not only in P concentration but also in\nthe rate of release of plant-available P. The supply of P from organic materials at\nleast in the short term is probably less than from manufactured chemical\nfertilizer, in which case one unit of P from organic materials would substitute for\nless than a comparable unit of P from manufactured chemical fertilizer. The\neffectiveness in replacing P from manufactured chemical fertilizer might\nincrease, however, through longer-term application of organic materials.\nAppropriate adjustment in fertilizer P rates for P supplied by added organic\nmaterials is consequently a challenge.\nHigh input of K through irrigation water together with supply of K from soil\nhas likely contributed to the long-term production of rice\u2013wheat in Northwest\nIndia (Fig. 5) with little or no response to fertilizer K (Khurana et al. 2008). The\nintroduction of practices that markedly reduce the use of tube-well water, such as\nresource-conserving technologies (Ladha et al. 2009), could lead to more\nnegative K balances and increased need for fertilizer K (Fig. 5). The monitoring\nof changes in K balances and fertilizer K needs arising from the adoption of\nwater-saving technologies in areas with high use of tube-well water rich in K is\nmerited.\n\nPotassium deficiencies in the rice\u2013wheat system are more likely in areas with\nlittle K input from irrigation water and limited retention of crop residues.\nAlthough K is high in irrigation water from tube wells in the northwestern IGP\n(Pasricha et al. 2001), irrigation water can be lower in K in other rice\u2013wheat areas\nof the IGP. Analysis of 21 samples of irrigation water from tube wells in\nrice\u2013wheat areas of Uttaranchal, India, for example, revealed relatively low K\nconcentration ranging from 0.8 to 2.8 mg L\ufffd\ufffd, with a median of 1.3 mg L \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n(unpublished data, IRRI Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity project,\n1997\u20132000). At these K concentrations, the K input from irrigation water for a\nrice\u2013wheat cropping cycle would approximate 25 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, leading to markedly \u20131\nnegative K balances regardless of residue retention (Fig. 5).\nThe rice\u2013maize cropping system, because of the high yields of hybrid maize,\ncan be a large net exporter of K and P (Fig. 7). The conversion of rice\u2013rice or\nrice\u2013wheat to rice\u2013maize cropping could lead to a rapid depletion of soil K and P\nif K and P fertilizer are not appropriately adjusted to account for the higher crop\nproduction and plant accumulation of nutrients. Guidelines for determining fieldspecific K and P requirements that optimally balance the trade-offs between\nshort-term profitability and longer-term sustainable productivity can therefore be\nespecially important for the emerging high-yielding rice\u2013maize system. Based on\nK balances, fertilizer K needs could be particularly high when maize residue is\nnot retained in the field either because of off-field value such as for fodder or\n\nbecause it is a nuisance during subsequent tillage and establishment practices for\nrice (Fig. 8b).\n\n\nDetermination of fertilizer K and P rates\n\n\nThe established RIE for K and P for a crop (i.e., 2.7 kg P and 15.9 kg K per tonne\nof grain for rice, Table 3) can be used to determine fertilizer P and K requirements\nthat are based on a targeted attainable yield, nutrient balances, and anticipated\nyield gain from the added nutrient. When yield gain from an added nutrient is\nsmall or negligible, the application of nutrient would not be recommended with\nsolely a yield gain approach (equations 7 and 8), but the failure to apply any\nnutrient could result in rapid nutrient depletion, especially at high yields (Fig. 10\nbd). A nutrient maintenance approach based on nutrient balances, on the other\nhand, would recommend application of nutrient even when yield gain is not\ncertain.\n\nUse of a full maintenance approach (equations 9 and 10) as advocated by\nWitt and Dobermann (2004) and Witt et al. (2007) for rice can result in relatively\nlarge applications of the nutrient, which would be unprofitable in the absence of a\nyield gain from the added nutrient. A partial maintenance approach, rather than a\nfull maintenance approach, for determining fertilizer requirements can include an\nestimate of nutrient supply as affected by soil processes and soil characteristics\nand provide an option to balance the trade-offs between longer-term sustained\nproductivity and short-term profitability.\nThe merit of a partial maintenance approach for determining fertilizer K\nrequirements can be illustrated with results from a long-term fertilizer\nexperiment with two rice crops per year in West Java, Indonesia (Abdulrachman\net al. 2006). The yield loss from not applying fertilizer K during the initial five\nyears (10 crops) was not statistically significant or certain to farmers in any\n\n\n\n380 381\n\n\nseason. Use of a yield gain approach in such a situation would result in no use of\nfertilizer K. Yet, the cumulative yield loss without fertilizer K for the 10 crops\nwas 3 t ha or 0.3 t ha crop\ufffd\ufffd. Use of a full maintenance approach would result in \u20131 \u20131 \u20131\nmean application of about 30 kg K ha for each crop, which could be financially \u20131\nunattractive with probable farm-gate prices for fertilizer and produced rice. Use\nof a lower fertilizer K rate based on an estimated sustainable extraction of K from\n\nsoil reserves (i.e., partial maintenance using K in equation 13) and considering S\nthe farm-gate price of harvested rice relative to the farm-gate fertilizer price\ncould help ensure a balance between short-term profitability and longer-term\nsustained productivity without a yield loss due to K deficiency.\nWe consequently recommend use of a partial maintenance approach for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P requirements when yield gain from an added\nnutrient is small or negligible. Based on the results of analyses in our study, we\nrecommend a partial maintenance approach in which fertilizer rates are\ncalculated to ensure that the depletion of the nutrient does not exceed a threshold\nlimit (K and P ) regardless of yield (equations 13 and 14). This avoids the risk of S S\nincreasing nutrient depletion with increasing yield.\nWhen a detectable yield gain from an added nutrient is certain, an approach\nother than solely maintenance or yield gain appears merited. Witt and\nDobermann (2004) and Witt et al. (2007) combined full maintenance of soil\nfertility and yield gain approaches to determine fertilizer K and P requirements.\nThey did not sum the fertilizer rates determined from full maintenance and yield\ngain approaches. Rather, they separately calculated fertilizer K or P rates with the\ntwo approaches and then selected the larger of the two calculated values as the\nfertilizer requirement. In this fashion the nutrient recommendation was never less\nthan full maintenance and was potentially higher than full maintenance when\nyield gain from the added nutrient was appreciable.\nThe full maintenance plus yield gain approach of Witt and Dobermann\n(2004) and Witt et al. (2007) can result in a relatively large application of nutrient,\nwhich can potentially be unprofitable when farm-gate fertilizer prices are high\nrelative to the farm-gate price of produced grain and crop response to the nutrient\nis modest. Based on the analyses in our study, we consequently recommend a\npartial maintenance plus yield gain approach to determine fertilizer requirements\nwhen the crop responds to the added nutrient. The calculated fertilizer\nrequirement is the sum of the amount determined by partial maintenance and\nyield gain (equations 15 to 18 and equations 21 to 24). Calculated fertilizer\nrequirements can result in positive nutrient balances, but the fertilizer rates can\nalso result in slightly negative nutrient balances (Fig 12 bd and 13 bd) because\nmaintenance is only partial. Our analysis highlighted the merit of expressing\nyield gain as a fraction of targeted yield rather than an absolute amount, because\nmeasured yield gains from fertilizer K and P across a wide range of yields\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\napproximate a fraction of the yield with full fertilization (Fig. 9).\nThe procedures and algorithms presented for determining fertilizer K and P\nrequirements for rice can also be used for wheat and maize with appropriate RIEs\ndetermined by QUEFTS for the crops. The threshold limit for nutrient extraction\nfrom soil reserves (K and P ) could differ between rice and wheat or maize S S\n\nbecause the release of soil nutrients can differ between saturated anaerobic soils\n\nin rice cultivation and aerobic soils in wheat and maize cultivation. Soil\n\nsubmergence in rice cultivation, for example, tends to increase P availability\n(Turner and Gilliam 1976), which might conceivably affect the limit of\nsustainable nutrient extraction from soil reserves as well as the yield gain of a\ncrop from fertilizer P. For rice\u2013wheat and rice\u2013maize systems, this can influence\nthe optimal distribution of fertilizer P between rice and the non-rice crop in the\nrotation (Gill and Meelu 1983).\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nFertilizer K and P requirements for a specific field can be determined with an\nSSNM-based approach using attainable target yield, nutrient balances, and\nprobable yield gains from added nutrient. One standardized RIE value per\nnutrient for a crop facilitates the determination of nutrient balances in the\nalgorithms. The partial maintenance and partial maintenance plus yield gain\napproaches that we have presented can be used in computer-based decision tools\nsuch as Nutrient Manager for Rice (IRRI 2010), which is designed to quickly\nprovide extension workers, crop advisors, and farmers with fertilizer best\nmanagement practices for specific rice fields. Each decision tool consists of\nquestions readily answered within 15 minutes without the need for soil analysis.\nThe responses to the questions provide sufficient information to develop fieldspecific fertilizer K and P recommendations using approaches and algorithms we\nhave described in this paper. The generic SSNM-based principles and algorithms\nwe presented for K and P are well suited for the rapid development and extension\nof field-specific fertilizer recommendations for rice, and they can be readily\nadapted for use with wheat and maize.\n\n\n**Acknowledgme** nt The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),\n\nthe International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), the International Plant\nNutrition Institute (IPNI), and the International Potash Institute (IPI) supported\nthe research from which most data in this paper were obtained and through which\nthe principles of SSNM that make this paper possible were developed.\nWe thank Ms. Nadialin Borje for the compilation of the data set and the\nQUEFTS analysis.

Several experimental evidences\nshowed that potassium balances in rice-based cropping systems are essentially\nnegative due to deficit application rates of the nutrient compared to its uptake.This\nhas lead to considerable K mining from soils that is undesirable for long term\nsustainability of rice-based systems. Potassium dynamics in soils are governed by\nthe mineralogy, while the K\u2013supplying capacity of the soils depends on the nature\nof the K-bearing minerals and the extent of weathering. Variability in type and\nstate of weathering of the K-bearing minerals as well as difference in management\nhistory leads to spatial difference in K fertility of soils. The current practice of\napplying potassium at a blanket dose without taking into account such variability\nis thus limiting crop yield and causing K mining as was evident from long-term\nexperiments. The concept of site-specific potassium management in rice-based\ncropping systems on the other hand provides an approach that takes into account\nthe K supplying capacity of soils and K requirement of crops while formulating\npotassium recommendations. Experimental evidences showed that such an\napproach can improve yield and economics of production of rice-based cropping\nsystems and can reverse the current negativeyield trends.\n\n\n\n**Keywords** potassium imbalance in Indian agriculture \ufffd soil mineralogy and\n\npotassium availability \ufffd site specific potassium management \ufffd rice based\ncropping systems\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nPotassium (K) did not receive much attention in India till the '80s because of the\ngeneral belief that the Indian soils were well supplied with potassium (Pasricha\n\n\nSK Sanyal\nBidhanChandra KrishiViswavidyalaya,Kalyani-741235,Nadia,WestBengal,India\ne-mail: sarojsanyal@yahoo.co.in\nMS Gill\nDirectorateof Extension,PunjabAgriculturalUniversity,Ludhiana-141004,India\nK Majumdar\nInternational Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), India Programme, 354, Sector 21, HUDA,\nGurgaon 122 016, Haryana,India, e-mail:kmajumdar@ipni.net\n\n\n388 389\n\n\nand Bansal 2001). However, the picture of crop responses to potassium in India\nhas been changing with time. Indeed, there is a growing evidence of increasing\ndeficiency of K as a result of imbalanced use of nitrogen (N) or N and phosphorus\n(P). Even under the so-called optimum rates of NPK application in long-term\nexperiments, the K balance under most of the soil-cropping systems was negative\n(Subba-Rao et al. 2001). Such imbalance in potassium application, however, has\nvariable impact on crop production due to the fact that K-supplying capacities of\nsoils vary based on mineralogy and dynamics of a particular soil type. So the\ncurrent practice of applying potassium at a blanket dose without taking into\naccount the soil concerned is either limiting crop yield and causing K mining\n(deficit K application) or wasting resource that are entirely imported (excess\napplication). Attaining Food Security had been a major challenge for the nation\nsince independence. The current stagnation in food grain production necessitates\nspecial initiatives to meet the increasing demands of food grains. Expansion of the\narea sown to rice, and crops grown in sequence to it, has ceased to be a major\nsource of increased output. Most of the targeted increase in production must now\nresult from greater yield per hectare.Appropriate nutrient management in general\nand potassium management in particular, will play a major role in overcoming\nstagnation in food grain production. Future strategies for potassium management\nneed to be more site-specific and dynamic based on a quantitative understanding\nof the congruence between nutrient supply and crop demand. The current paper\naims at analyzing the role of site-specific potassium management in improving\nproductivityof rice-basedcropping sequences.\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdscenario\ufffdin\ufffdIndia**\n\n\nPotassium (K) has long been a neglected nutrient in Indian agriculture.Analysis of\nthe fertilizer consumption scenario over the past decades shows that potash\ncontributed to less that 10% of the total nutrient consumption in the country.\nRemoval of K in proportion to N is very high in cropping systems, particularly\nthose involving cereal and fodder crops (Yadav et al. 1998) (Table 1). Potassium\nrequirements of crops are in general identical to N and 3-5 times higher than P.\nHowever, average K use in India over the last 30 years has been about one-seventh\nof N and about one-third of P.\n\nAn illustrative balance-sheet of NPK in Indian agriculture (Table 2) shows an\nannual depletion of K\ufffdO to the tune of 10.20 Mt and 5.97 Mt on gross and net basis, 2\nrespectively (Tandon 2004). Of the current net negative NPK balance or annual\ndepletion of 9.7 Mt, 19% is N, 12% Pand 69% K. Such alarming contribution of K\ntowards the negativebalanceof NPK is a major concern.\nConsequence of such imbalanced K application is evident in the information\nbased on analysis of more than 11 million soil samples that reflect the changing K\nfertility status of soils in different parts of the country (Hasan 2002). The\ndistribution of districts considered low, medium, and high in K fertility show that\n\n\n\n**Table\ufffd1** Nutrient\ufffduptake\ufffdin\ufffdimportant\ufffdcropping\ufffdsystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Crop sequence|Applied(kg ha- 1)|Col3|Col4|Total<br>yield<br>(t ha- 1)|Total uptake (kg ha- 1)|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Crop sequence|N|P O<br>2<br>5|K O<br>2|K O<br>2|N|P O<br>2<br>5|K O<br>2|\n|Maize-Wheat-Green gram<br>Rice-Wheat-Green gram<br>Maize-wheat<br>Rice-Wheat<br>Maize-Wheat<br>Pigeon pea-Wheat<br>P.

Thus, 21%\nof the districts are low, 51% are medium, and 28% are high, using the nutrient\nindex values suggested by Ramamurthy and Bajaj (1969). Comparing these\nresults with those presented earlier by Ghosh and Hasan (1980), the low and high\ncategories have decreased by 0.6 and 6.4%, respectively, while the medium\ncategory increased by 7 **%.** All this indicates that K fertilizers were scantily\napplied in the last two decades as the low category has virtually remained the\nsame and the high area has fallen.\n\n\n**Rice-based\ufffdcropping\ufffdsystems**\n\n\nRice is the most important crop in India and plays a critical role in food security.\nMore importantly, it is a choice crop of the millions of poor and small farmers not\n\n\n\n390 391\n\n\nonly for income but also for household food security. Intensification and\ndiversification are two main trends of rice-based cropping systems as they have\nevolved in different agro-ecological regions in India where wheat, maize or one of\nmany other secondary crops are grown during the part of the year when rice was\nnot in the field. Diversification and intensification of rice-based systems was\nadvocated to make a breakthrough in productivity and profitability, and several\noptions with different levels of productivity and profitability were outlined by\n(Gill 2006; Gill et al. 2008). The most prevalent cropping systems are rice\u2013rice,\nrice\u2013 rice\u2013rice, rice\u2013rice\u2013pulse, rice\u2013wheat, rice\u2013oilseed crop, and more recently\nrice\u2013maize. The rotation of rice-rice and rice-wheat, for example, are major\nagricultural production systems that account for 16 M ha of food grain producing\narea in India and are the mainstayof food security in the country.\nHowever, the rice sector has witnessed rapid dynamism in production\nprocesses. After a four-fold increase in production during the past four decades,\nthe production curves have started showing downward trend and productivity\ndecelerating since the later half of the 1990s. The productivity decline is\nexperienced not only in the core green revolution state of Punjab but also in several\nother states such as Tamilandu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, etc., including the\nrain-fed areas.There are several reasons for such stagnation, the most conspicuous\nbeing wide-scale nutrient depletion through crop harvest, on one hand and low\nlevelof replenishmentthrough inadequatenutrientsupply, on the other.\nTiwari et al. (2006) in their multi-location trial with rice-wheat system\nshowed that the average system uptake (rice + wheat) of nutrients over 10 sites\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nand 2 years was 761 kg of N + P\ufffdO + K\ufffdO ha year for an average system yield of 2 5 2\n\n\n-1\n\n13 t ha . The mean uptake of N: P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO was in the proportion of 100:29:129. 2 5 2\nSimilar experiments with rice-rice system across 6 sites and 2 years showed\n\n\n-1\n\naverage uptake of 782 kg of N +P\ufffdO + K\ufffdO for an average system yield of 12 t ha 2 5 2\nwith an average uptake ratio of 100:40:133 for N:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO. The mean K uptake 2 5 2\nwas 1.74 times the K input in case of rice-wheat system, while mean uptake was\n62% higher than K input in rice-rice system suggesting net depletion of soil K in all\nthe sites. The K-omission plots (no external K application) in this study showed\nthat native potassium supply in rice-wheat system varied from 205 to 354 kg K\ufffdO 2\nha year depending on location. In treatments based on K supply exclusively -1 -1\nfrom native sources (K-omission plots), the yield levels supported by sites differed\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nconsiderably. Thus, Ranchi with a native supply of 205 kg K\ufffdO ha year produced 2\n65% lesser system yield (rice-wheat) than did Ludhiana which provided 354 kg\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nK\ufffdO ha year in absence of external supply (Tiwari et al., 2006). Similar results 2\nwere obtained in rice-rice cropping system by the authors. This suggests that sitespecific potassium application, based on estimation of soil supply and crop\nrequirement, will be required to support equal levels of yields in rice-based\ncropping systems in different locations.\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Mineralogyand K availability**\n\n\nPotassium availability to plants is regulated in soils by the soluble, exchangeable\nand non-exchangeable fractions of K that are interrelated by a dynamic\nequilibrium. The driving force for this equilibrium is largely a function of clay\ncomposition, while the magnitude of the process is a function of clay content of\nsoil. As growing season is limited in most cases, a high growth rate for high yield\ncan only be maintained with high flux rates of nutrients to the plant roots.\nTherefore, mineralogy plays a pivotal role in potassium supplying capacity of a\nparticular soil (Rao and Rao 1996). The mineral sources of K in soils are the\ndioctahedral micas: muscovite, glauconite, and hydrous mica or illite; the\ntrioctahedral mica, namely biotite and phlogopite and the feldspar, namely\nsanidine, orthoclase and microlone (Sarma 1976). Weathering of micas / feldspars\nleads to the formation of secondary minerals (such as smectiteor vermiculites), _via_\nintermediates like illites, with simultaneous release of K (Sparks and Huang\n1985). Results of numerous studies (Sanyal et al. 2009) suggest that for soils of\nlow intensity of weathering and from trioctahedral mica parent material, K release\nto soil solution is rather high as for the crop need and the replenishment of the\nexhausted K in soil due to crop removal. For soils of dioctahedral mica parent\nmaterial, and a moderate state of weathering or both, K release is less, but it is the\nleast for soils of low mica content or intensive weathering, or both. Indeed, while\nformulating a sound K fertilizer recommendation, it is imperative that the above\ncharacteristicsneed to be taken into account.\n\nPlant uptake of K is related to the weathering of feldspars and micas in soil\nenvironments. Micas are more important than K-feldspars in supplying K to plants\n(Rich 1972). The native K status depends, not only on the parent material of soil,\nbut also on the subsequent stages of weathering of the parent material. So the\nweathering history of a mineral phase, rather than its mere presence, may be an\nimportant factor to be reckoned while relating the plant availability of soil K to the\nsoil mineralogy (Sanyal and Majumdar 2001). An example of such postulate is\nprovided by a sharp contrast between the Entisol and the Alfisol under rice-based\ncropping sequence inWest Bengal (Table 3) where despite having almost the same\namount of illite content, there was a wide variation in total K and nonexchangeable\nK (NEK) contents of these soils (Sanyal et al. 2009). This obviously is linked to\nthe relative stages of weathering of the illitic mineral phase in the given soils\n(Sanyal et al. 2009; Ghosh and Sanyal 2006). Such observations have important\nbearing to the fertilizer K recommendations to support the different cropping\n\nsequences.\nRecently, Chatterjee (2008) found wide variability in soil K fractions in\nselected rice growing soils in the alluvial tract of West Bengal.

The long-term experiments also\nrevealed that response to applied potassium increased steadily over the last 20\nyears as a result of depletion of soil K (Swarup and Srinivasa Rao 1999). Singh et\n\n\n\n394 395\n\n\nal. (2002) in a 8 year rice-wheat cropping system experiment observed that\napplication of K at 33 kg ha to both the crops caused a negative potassium balance -1\nof 103 to 156 kg ha year -1 -1 depending on the rate of N application. Such changes in\nK fertility under intensive cropping, however, can also be quite abrupt,\nparticularly when vegetables are included in the rice-based system. Sen et al.\n(2008), while assessing changes in nutrient availability through GIS-based\nfertility mapping, found that K fertility in an intensively cultivated village in the\nalluvial zone ofWest Bengal decreased perceptibly within two years. For available\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nK\ufffdO, the range changed from 87-448 kg ha in 2006 to 56-375 kg ha in 2008 2\nand the mean from 166 kg ha in 2006 to 88 kg ha in 2008. Potassium fertility of -1 -1\nthe village was generally low to medium in 2006 but the frequency distribution\nshifted more towards the low fertility category with a substantial increase in\nsample number in the lowest category (Figure 1). The authors found that lower\napplication of potassium during this period due to unavailability and high uptake\nof K by the vegetable crops contributed to this swift decline in K fertility of the\nsoils.\n\nConsequence of such depletion scenario across the country has led to negative\npotassium balance in most cropping systems, including rice-based systems. Ladha\net al. (2003) analyzed yield trends in rice-wheat systems in the IGP, non-IGPareas\nof India and China and noted that rice and wheat yields stagnated at 72 and 85% of\nlong-term experiments where recommended rates of NPK were applied.

Site specific nutrient management (SSNM) provides an approach\nof nutrient management that takes into account 1) nutrient requirement for unit\nyield, 2) nutrient contribution from soils, and 3) nutrient contributions required\nfrom fertilizers to formulate fertilizer recommendation. Nutrient use on the\n\nprinciples of SSNM could provide an avenue to reverse the declining productivity\ntrend and nutrientminingfrom soils.\nUndoubtedly, rice based cereal cropping systems are very exhaustive and\nrequire high quantum of macro, secondary and micronutrients. They are practiced\nin a myriad of soil conditions in IGP and non-IGP areas. Variability in nutrient\nreserves, nutrient supplying capacity of the soils under these vastly different soil\nand climatic conditions and management strategies require that potassium is\napplied in a site-specific manner to improve productivity and maintain soil\nfertility.\nIt is well established that crop yields, profit, plant nutrient uptake and nutrient\nuse efficiencies can be significantly increased by applying fertilizers on a field\nspecific and crop season specific manner (Bijay-Singh et al. 2003). Fertilizer\nK rates predicted by the QUEFTS model (Janssen et al. 1990) to achieve high\nyield and maintain soil fertility are usually higher than the rates currently\napplied by farmers. Potassium rates in SSNM plots ranged from 50 to 66 kg ha -1\ncrop while the average farmer fertilizer K rate was 30 kg ha (Bijay-Singh et al. -1 -1\n2003).\nThe findings from a survey conducted by the Project Directorate for Cropping\nSystems Research (ICAR), India on the use pattern of nutrients to rice-wheat\nsystem in various sub-regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plains are presented inTable 7.\nThe economic, social and climatic factors as well as soil and institutional factors\nwere largely responsible for spatial variation in major nutrients application. The\nmost conspicuous point to note was the use of potassium in a much imbalanced\nmanner in both the crops that seems to be the prime factor causing yield stagnation\nof rice-wheatsystem in IGP.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\nauthors further reported that fertilizer K rates used were not sufficient to sustain a\nneutral K input-output balance in 90% of the long-term experiments, while all the\nexperiments with significant yield decline had large negative K balances. It is clear\nthat such negative K balances in soils will adversely affect the sustainability of\nrice-based systems and a rational approach of K management, keeping in mind the\nvariable soil supplying power and nutrient requirements of crops/cropping\nsystems, will be necessary to reverse the trend.\n\n\n**Site-specificpotassium management**\n\n\n\n2\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 397\n\n\n**Table\ufffd7** Major\ufffdnutrients\ufffduse\ufffdin\ufffdvarious\ufffdsub\ufffdregions\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdIndo-Gangetic\ufffdPlains\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n|Sub region of IGP|Area<br>(X 103<br>ha)|Nutrient use (kg ha- 1)|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Sub region of IGP|Area<br>(X 10<br>ha)<br>3|N|N|P|P|K|K|\n|Sub region of IGP|Area<br>(X 10<br>ha)<br>3|Rice|Wheat|Rice|Wheat|Rice|Wheat|\n|Trans-Gangetic Plains<br>Upper-Gangetic Plains<br>Mid-Gangetic Plains<br>Lower-Gangetic Plains|3809<br>3160<br>3133<br>119|166.1<br>115.0<br>116.1<br>82.6|154.2<br>109.8<br>100.0<br>87.1|51.3<br> 40.7<br> 29.1<br> 16.3|49.6<br>37.6<br>32.7<br>21.4|0.8<br>5.2<br>4.3<br> 36.4|12.3<br>11.4<br>20.5<br>44.0|\n\n\nAdapted\ufffdfrom\ufffdSharma\ufffd(2003)\ufffdafter\ufffdmodification\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\nRecent work on site-specific potassium management (SSKM) by Chatterjee\nand Sanyal (2007) across three locations and twelve sites in the alluvial soils of\nWest Bengal showed significant yield increase in the SSKM plot over the general\nrecommendation.

The SSNM requires intensive soil sampling and analyses in\norder to construct crop- and soil-specific nutrient recommendation. This provides\na major challenge considering the fragmented land holdings in the country as well\nas the existing soil testing infrastructure. Geo-statistical analysis and GIS-based\nmapping effectively counters that challenge by providing an option to create soil\nfertility maps of large areas through interpolation of soil analysis data from a small\nnumber of samples (Sen et al. 2008). Such dynamic maps provide an opportunity\nto assess variability in distribution of native nutrients across a large area and thus\naid in strategizing appropriate management of nutrients leading to better yield and\nenvironmental protection. Indeed, in India, where each farm family operates one\nor several small field plots, farmers' fertilizer decision making process is\ncommonly limited by inadequate understanding of soil nutrient status or spatial\nnutrient variability of their plots, with such understanding on spatial variability of\nsoil nutrients in fragmented land-holdings being expected to give a strong impact\non the sustainable development of agriculture in the country.As mentioned earlier,\nSanyal and Chatterjee (2007) revealed that contrast of non-exchangeable\npotassium and available potassium status between soils can be effectively utilized\nto modify the soil test-based fertilizer recommendation practices for potassium.\nSen and Majumdar (2006) and Sen et al. (2008) documented wide spatial\nvariability in available nutrient contents of soils even in small areas of intensively\ncultivated region of West Bengal. Such studies clearly highlighted the necessity to\ncomprehensively understand the spatial variability of soil nutrients under the\nprevalent small-scale operation systems in India for developing the guidelines for\nsoil nutrient management and fertilization for optimum production (Sen et al.\n2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Fig. 2**\n\n\n\nInterrelation between grain yield and uptake of potassium in rice (IET\n1444)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Mukhopadhyay et al. 2008\n\n\n\nPotassium based nutrient management tested at cultivators' field under theAll\nIndia Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Cropping System (2006-07) had\nhighlighted the response of potassium and sulphur in rice-wheat system. The\naverage nutrient management options under the existing farmers' crop\nmanagement practice (FCM) gave 4.32 to 6.95 t ha paddy yield, which improved -1\nby 3 to 25% with recommended management practice at different locations.\nInclusion of K, S and Zn, along with farmers' management, produced extra yield of\n0.75 to 1.78 t ha -1 depending on locations. The corresponding response to\npotassium over N P clearly demonstrated the major role of potassium towards\nenhancement in yield (Table 10). Wheat productivity increased from 0.13 to 0.68 t\nha -1 over farmers' fertilizer management practice (FFP), along with the\ncorresponding response to potassium application being 0.13 to 0.68 t ha over NP, -1\nthereby stressing the fact that yield and response to potassium are variable and K\nmust be applied in a site-specific manner to improve productivity of rice based\nsystems.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Spatial variabilityand GIS mapping:Akey to future**\n\n\nThus, the question that arises now is where one goes from such concepts like\ntargeted yield, soil test recommendation, and SSNM for efficient and balanced use\n\n\n\n400 401\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nLarger proportion of mining in respect of potassium as mentioned in previous\nsections partly result from the average crop removal of 1.5 times more K than that\nof N and lower K application than N or P, with the misconception that the soils of\nthe country are relatively rich in potash. Apart from this, relatively low cost per\nunit of nitrogen, its widespread availability, and quick and evident response of the\nplant has further accentuated such an imbalance. While it will be necessary to\nrationalize the use of N fertilizers, ominous signs are that if strategies and policies\nare not developed to boost K supplies, and this essential nutrient continues to\nremain neglected as in the past, future sustainability of rice-based systems is likely\nto be constrained mostly by K. Sustainability of the regions supporting high\nintensity cropping and fertilizer responsive strains are foreseen to be the earliest\nvictims of such imbalance. Besides, our current understanding and interest on soil\nquality requires that enough focus is given towards the mining aspects of nutrients\nin general and potash in particular.As much as it may seem economically prudent\nto apply less potassium from external sources as it is an imported commodity, and\nrely more on the inherent potash supplying capacity of the soils, in the long-run it\nmight turn out to be a very short-sighted approach as we lose the quality of a very\nvital resource of our country, our SOILS. Rather a balanced approach that takes\ninto account soil properties, its potassium supplying capacity and potassium\nrequirement of crops in the realm of site-specific nutrient management can reverse\nthe declining production trend, improve the soil quality and thus will leave our\nenvironmentcleanfor the posterity.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAnnual Report (2006-07) All India Coordinated Research Project on Cropping\nSystem Research.

In this\nstudy, Ershilipu village of Xinzhou city in Shanxi Province, which encompassed\n245 ha and consisted of 443 farmer's plots, was selected as experimental sites to\ndevelop the approach to meet the needs of site-specific nutrient management for\nthe small scale operation under family responsibility system in China. Two\nhundred and eighty plow layer (0-20 cm) soil samples were collected on a 100\n\u00d7100 m grid prior to the plots being sown for maize. Soil pH, organic matter (OM),\navailable P, K, Zn, and other nutrients were measured. The results showed that\nOM, P, Zn and Fe were the main limiting factors in the soil. Spatial variability of\ntested soil properties in the experimental village was observed. Great variation\nwas observed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B, and small spatial variation in soil K\nresulting from the little fertilizer input. The spatial variability of soil OM and Ca\nrelied mainly on regional factors. The variability of soil nutrient was greatly\nrelated to fertilization history, fertilizer application level, and soil texture. Sitespecific nutrient management (SSNM) based on regionalized balanced\nfertilization helped to produce higher yield and income due to rational nutrient\nsupply to crop.\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\nSSNM GIS \ufffd \ufffd Soil nutrients Spatialvariability \ufffd\n\n\n\n**Abbreviations** DGPS: differential global positioning system; OM: organic\n\nmatter;SSNM: site specificnutrientmanagement\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\n\nSoil nutrient management with information technology is an important part of\ninformation agriculture (Atherton et al. 1999; Borgre and Mallarino 1997; Bouma\n\n\nPing He Jiyun Jin\nBeijingOffice of the InternationalPlant Nutrition Institute,Beijing100081 China\ne-mail:phe@ipni.net\nHongtingWang\nInstitute of Soil and Fertilizer, ShanxiAcademy ofAgricultural Sciences, Taiyuan\n030031 China\n\n\n406 407\n\n\net al. 1999). Compared with developed countries, China is far behind in terms of\ninformation technology use in soil nutrient management (Jin and Jiang 2000). The\nsmall scale farmer's farmland and variability in their fertilization practices caused\nthe great variability in soil nutrient status. A fertilizer application survey\ninvestigation in Shanxi province indicated that the percentage of time that N\napplication rate exceeded 250 kg N ha was 20 percent for wheat and 25 percent \u20131\nfor maize, and the percentage of time that N application rate less than 150 kg N ha \u20131\naccounted for 56 percent for wheat and 53 percent for maize (Yang et al. 2008).\nContinuous cropping without balanced and efficient use of fertilizers has\ncontributed to not only losses in yield and profit, but also to environmental\nproblems such as groundwater nitrate-N contamination and eutrophication of\nrivers. Therefore, how to manage soil nutrient for the small scale operation with\ninformationtechnologyis of great challengein managingsoil nutrient.\nIn China, due to the small-scale farm size and the cost of soil testing, it is\nimpossible to give fertilizer recommend fertilizer based on each farmer. Usually,\nthe same amount of fertilizer is recommended for a 15- to 20 ha field irrespective\nof the soil nutrient variability within the field. Thus, some areas of a field will\nreceive too much fertilizer, whereas other areas will receive too little. A better\nunderstanding of the spatial variability of soil nutrients is required as a basis of soil\nnutrient management and rational fertilizer application (Hammond 1994; Franzen\net al. 1996). Site-specific nutrient management in developed countries is based on\na large scale of farm size with a high level of mechanization. With the rapid\nprogresses of rural development and thereafter movement of farmers working in\nthe city, and the policy on stimulation of the farm land transition to the larger size,\nfertilizer precision management based on soil nutrient variability would inevitably\nmake great progress.\nIn this study, a systematic analysis of soil nutrient variability in a maize\nproduction area associated with the application of corresponding management\napproach was carried out. The objectives were 1) to investigate spatial variation of\nsoil nutrient status and its distribution; 2) to develop nutrient management strategy\nbased on nutrient variation; and 3) to evaluate the effect of nutrient management\non yieldand profits.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nSoil sampling and analysis\n\n\nAtotal of 280 soil samples from 0-20 cm depth were collected on a 100\u00d7100 m grid\nin the study areas of guided by using differential global positioning system\n(DGPS) technology with a trimble 132 GPS receiver. All soil samples were airdried and ground through 2 mm sieve prior to analysis. The soil nutrients were\ndetermined with procedures applied by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural\nSciences (CAAS) and International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) Cooperative\nSoil and Plant Analysis Laboratory and the National Laboratory of Soil Testing\nand Fertilizer Recommendation of CAAS as described by Portch and Hunter\n(2002).Available P, K, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn of the soil samples were extracted using\n0.25 M/LNaHCO\ufffd, 0.01 M/LEDTAand 0.01 M/LNH\ufffdF.The concentration of Pin 3 4\nthe extraction was measured by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method.\nConcentration of K, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were determined using an atomic\nabsorption spectrophotometer. The organic matter (OM) of the soil samples was\nextracted with an extracting solution containing 0.2 M/L NaOH, 0.01 M/L EDTA\nand 2 percent methyl alcohol, and the concentration of OM in the extract was\ndetermined by colormetry method. Soil pH was measured in a 2.5:1 soil-water\nsuspension using a glass pH electrode. Soil nitrate-N was extracted with a 2 M/L\nKCl solution, and the concentration of nitrate-N in the extract was analyzed using\nan ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 220 and 275 nm (Chen et al. 1995; Wang et al.\n2004).\n\n\nData analysis\n\n\nDescriptivestatisticsand geo-statisticswere used to analyzethe data.ANOVAwas\ncalculated using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The structure of spatial variation was\nanalyzed through semivariograms using GS+ for Windows 3.1. Spatial\ndistribution was analyzed through kriging interpolation using ArcGIS 8.0\nsoftware.\n\nA semivariogram from the set of sample data is calculated using the\nfollowing equation(Chil s and Delfiner 1999):\n\n\n`\uff0d` 2\n_\u03b3(h)_ =[1/2 _N(h)_ ] [ ( _Z x+h_ _i_ ) Z( )] _x_ _i_ `(\ufffd)1`\n\n\n\n**Materialsand methods**\n\n\nLocationof trials\n\n\nThe trials were located at Ershilipu village, Boming town, Xinzhou city, Shanxi\nprovine.

The sill expresses the distance (range) beyond which i\nsamples are not correlated.\nKriging of geo-statistics is an optimum interpolation technique for marking\nunbiased estimates of regionalized variables at unsampled locations in which the\nstructural properties of the semivariogram and the values of a soil variable _Z_ at an\nunsampledpoint X is estimatedby the formula (Chil s and Delfiner 1999): 0\n\n\n\n**Table 1** Soil OM, available nutrient and pH in the maize production area under\nstudy\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n_Z_\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n_n_\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n# \ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n# ( X 0 ) \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd i Z ( X i )\n\n_i_ \ufffd1\n\n\n\n\n# Z ( X 0 ) \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd i Z ( X i\n\n_i_ \ufffd1\n\n\n\n`\uff08\ufffd\uff09` 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere X denotes the set of spatial coordinates (X\ufffd, X\ufffd), 1 2 _n_ is the number of\nneighboring samples and `\u03bbi` are the weights associated with the sampling points\nXi.

Table 1 showed that most of the soils were low in soil\nOM, and deficient P, Zn and Fe, with the percentage of soil samples below the\ncritical value being 100, 86, 94 and 77, respectively. About 23percent of the soils\nwere relatively low in K, whereas soil S, Mn and Cu contents were above medium\nevaluation levels, with average values of 44.6 mg l, 6.1 mg l and 1.4 mg l, -1 -1 -1\nrespectively. Soil Ca, Mg and B contents were much higher than the critical values.\nGreat variation existed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B content with C.V. of 47.5percent,\n46.0percent,38.5percent,37.6percentand 42.0percent,respectively(Table 1).\n\n\nSpatialvariationof soil nutrients\n\n\nSemi-variograms analysis revealed a distinct different degree of spatial variability\nof soil nutrients.

About 20percent and\n23percent of the spatial variability for OM and Ca were due to random factors\nassociated with human activities (such as fertilization, crop varieties, management\nlevels, etc), which demonstrated that spatial variability for soil OM and Ca was\nmainly relied on regional factors (e.g. topography, climate and soil matrix).

The contour map of soil properties may directly reflect the spatial\ndistribution characteristic of diversified soil nutrient element; also help to\nunderstand the nutrient status to provide the foundation to rational fertilization.\nThe integrated map was conducted with overlaying the nutrient contour map and\nfarmer's plot map to understand soil nutrient status of each farmer's plot. If soil\nnutrient contents in most areas of a farmer's plot were within one evaluation class,\n\n\n**Fig.\ufffd2** Semivariograms\ufffdfor\ufffdsoil\ufffdpH,\ufffdOM,\ufffdP,\ufffdK\ufffdand\ufffdZn\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdstudy\ufffdarea\n\n\n\nsoil nutrient contents for all area of that farmer's plot were considered to fall within\none evaluation class. This made it possible to improve the fertilizer\nrecommendation system from one recommendation from 15-20 ha field to a sitespecificnutrientmanagementfor a specificfarmer's plot.\nThe distribution area with high P and K contents which was over the critical\nlevel was located in the middle of the eastern part of the village, and that with\nmedium P and K nutrient level was distributed in the western part of the village.\nThe distribution area with lowest P and K contents was located at the south and\n\nnorth bottom of the village. Soil Zn distribution map was similar to soil P (Fig. 3).\nIt was indicated that great spatial variation existed in soil nutrients, and spatial\ndistributionsimilaritywas observed in the soil P, K and Zn.\n\n\nYield and profit evaluationof SSNM\n\n\nThe site specific fertilizer recommendation (SSNM) significantly increased corn\nyield and farmer's income compared to farmer's conventional practice. The\naverage yield of spring maize increased by 12.4percent and average farmer's\nincome increased by 798 Yuan/ha (117US$/ha) from SSNM fertilizer\nrecommendation compared to farmer's conventional practice in the experimental\nsite. These results showed that site-specific soil nutrient management based on\nfarmer's field unit can help to produce higher yield and income due to rational\nnutrientsupply to crop.\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nPrevious and the current study indicated that great variation existed in soil nutrient\ndue to the small scale farm size production, different cropping system and\ndifferent fertilization custom (Yang et al; 2000; Huang et al., 2003, 2006). The\nresult obtained in the current study indicated that great variation for soil OM, P,\nand Zn existed in the study area, and the survey of crop production history and\nfertilizer application indicated that a close relationship existed between the spatial\nvariability of the soil nutrients and the crop production history and fertilizer\napplication rates. For example, the higher contents of soil P, K and Zn at mid\neastern of the village were resulted from the corresponding vegetable production\nwith heavy inorganic and organic nutrient input. The medium nutrient levels for P\nand K were located at the western part, where was the maize production area with\ncertain nutrient input less than those from vegetable production area. The reasons\nfor lower contents of Pand K located at south and north bottom parts were the soils\nwith sandy loamtextureand relativelylow nutrientinputs from farmers.\nThe site-specific nutrient management practices have been carried out based\non the variation of soil nutrients. For the areas with great nutrient spatial variation,\nthe fertilizer recommendation would regionalize the study area with variable\n\n\n\n412 413\n\n\n**Fig. 3** Distributionof soil P, K and Zn in the experimentalsite\n\n\n\nfertilizer application rate; while for the areas with small nutrient spatial variation,\nan uniformed fertilization rate would be recommended.Yang et al. (2000) reported\nthat the application of grid sampling and variable rate application technology in a\n54-ha cotton field increased fertilizer efficiency, with a net profit of 5313 RMB\nYuan ha -1 (RMB Yuan 8.26 = US$ 1) higher than that obtained with local\nfertilization practice. Huang et al. (2003) reported that the incorporation of\nregionalized balanced fertilization technology into wheat and corn farming\npractices significantly increased income by 590-1350 RMB Yuan ha . The results -1\nobtained in this study demonstrated that maize yield increased by 12.4percent and\nprofit increased by RMBYuan 798 ha with the regionalized balanced fertilization -1\ncompared with that by farmer's practice. It was indicated that site specific nutrient\nmanagement practice based on nutrient spatial variation with regionalized\nbalancedfertilizationis a promising nutrientmanagementpracticein China.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\nThe great variability in farmer's fertilization practices resulted in the great spatial\nvariation in soil nutrient status in the study area. The soil OM, P, Zn and Fe was\ndeficient in high percentage of nutrient values below the critical values. Large\nvariation in nutrient contents was observed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B. On the\ncontrary, soil K had a smaller spatial variability due to little nutrient input as\nfertilizer. The variability of soil OM and Ca attributed mainly to random factors\nand regional factors (e.g. topography, climate and soil matrix), and that for pH and\nother nutrients related to more closely to random factors related to human\nactivities such as fertilization, cropping system, etc. The contour map of soil\nproperties may directly reflect the spatial distribution characteristic of diversified\nsoil nutrient, and help to understand the nutrient status to provide the foundation to\nrational fertilization; Site-specific nutrient management integrated with\nregionalized balanced fertilization based on farmer's field plot can help to produce\nhigher yieldand incomedue to rationalnutrientsupply to crop.\n\n\n**Acknowledgement** This\ufffdresearch\ufffdwas\ufffdsupported\ufffdby\ufffdthe\ufffdNational\ufffdBasic\ufffdResearch\n\nProgram\ufffdof\ufffdChina\ufffd(973\ufffdProgram)\ufffd(2007CB109306),\ufffdInternational\ufffdPlant\nNutrition\ufffdInstitute\ufffdand\ufffdShanxi Academy\ufffdof Agricultural\ufffdSciences.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAtherton BC, Morgan MT, Shearere SA, Stombawgh TS, Ward AD (1999) Sitespecific farming: A perspective on information needs, benefits, and\nlimitations.J SoilWater Conserv 54:455\u2013461\n\nBorges R, Mallarino AP (1997) Field-scale variability of phosphorus and\npotassium uptake by no-tillcorn and soybean.

Production and productivity of major crops in the state are lower\nthan national average probably due to imbalance and lower fertilizer consumption\nrate (62 kg ha ).

In long-term fertilizer studies with rice-rice and rice-pulse cropping\nsystems, the sustainability of crop yield was threatened in absence of K\napplication. In many production systems in the state, the non-exchangeable K\nmeets the K requirement and sustains the level of production. Higher correlation\nbetween HNO\ufffd-K and K balance and yield suggests the inclusion of this method in 3\nsoil testing programmes in the state. Optimal and super-optimal doses of K could\nnot sustain the yield and K depletion. Hence, a need to reschedule the K dose for\ncrops. An holistic management of K could be possible by applying adequate\namount of K on the basis of soil test, recycling of crop residues and addition of\nrural and non-toxic urban compost in different cropping systems under varying\nagro-ecological regions.

It is the 10 largest and 11 populous state accounting th th\nabout 5% of the geographical area and 4% of the population of the country.

The production and\nproductivity of major crops in the state are below the Indian average. In addition to\nsoil acidity, low fertilizer consumption (57 kg ha ) and imbalanced use of fertilizer -1\nare the reasons for low productivity. Although the state has experienced upward\ntrend in fertilizer use from 7.6 kg ha (1980) to 62 kg ha (2008 \u2013 09), the ratio of N -1 -1\nto K fertilizer is still wide, although narrowed down from 5.9 during 1980 to 4.43\nduring 2008\u201309.\nDuring 1960 to 1990, India experienced a dramatic change in food grain\nproduction with introduction of high yielding varieties and improved management\nstrategies. Later on, the yield level remains stagnant or declined even with increase\nin level of input. Evidence of declining partial or total factor productivity is\nalready available. Depletion of soil K was one of the reason of yield decline in long \ufffd\nterm fertilizerexperiment(Ladha et al. 2003).\nThe experience with rice \u2013 rice cropping system which started during 1972 \u2013\n73 in lateritic (Aric haplaquepts) soil of Bhubaneswar showed lack of response to\nK till 1983 and thereafter the response increased from 2.90 q ha to 8.95 q ha . In -1 -1\nmost of the cropping systems practiced in India, K balance is negative, however\nthe negative balance is not reflected in available K (Water soluble + Exchangeable\nK) status over years of cropping.Ahuge negative balance of 242.8 thousand tones\nper year in Orissa (Mishra and Mitra 2001) and proposed deficit of 8.1 million\ntones per year by 2020 (Katyal 2001) in Indian agriculture is a matter of concern.\nWe have attempted to discuss K dynamics and management practices for major\ncropping systems of Orissa under diverse agro-ecologicalsituations.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n|05)|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Crops|Productivity (q ha )<br>-1|Productivity (q ha )<br>-1|\n|Crops|Orissa|All India|\n|Rice<br>Wheat<br>Maize<br>Arhar<br>Groundnut<br>Sugarcane<br>Potato|14.5<br>13.3<br>13.2<br>6.8<br>15.1<br>686.0<br>94.9|19.8<br>26.0<br>19.0<br>6.6<br>10.2<br>647.5<br>179.2|\n\n\n**Soils of Orissa**\n\n\n\n0 / 0 /\n\n\n\nThe state of Orissa is situated between 17 47 and 22\ufffd33 N latitude and between\n81\ufffd21' and 87\ufffd30 E longitude. Based on physiography and relief, the state is 0 / 0 /\nbroadly classified into 4 broad physical divisions, namely Northern plateau,\nCentral tableland, Eastern Ghats and Coastal plains. The soils of Orissa come\nunder 4 orders namely Inceptisols (7.49 m ha),Alfisols (5.62 m ha), Entisols (1.53\nm ha) andVertisols (0.93 m ha). Inceptisols occupy 48% of total geographical area\n(TGA), represent older alluvial and mixed red and yellow soils. These soils have\nweak profile development and are at the beginning stage of soil formation.Alfisols\n(36% of TGA) represent red, laterite and lateritic and brown forest soils. These\nsoils are base rich mineral soil and characterized by light coloured surface horizon\nover a clay enriched argillic subsurface horizon. They are rich in Fe,Al oxides and\n\n\n\nmore strongly weathered that Inceptisols. Entisols (10% TGA) represent alluvial,\ncoastal saline and colluvial soil. These soils are recently formed soil with little\ndevelopment of pedogenic horizons and are seen in flood plains in delta areas.\nVertisols (6% TGA) are black or regur and occurs in specific locations of the state.\nThese soils are black or dark coloured, uniform with gilgai micro relief. The clay\ncontent is more than 30% and clay minerals are mostly smectitic.These soils swell\non wetting and shrink on drying with cracks of more than 1 cm wide and have\nangular blocky structure. About 70-75% of soils of Orissa are acidic and support\nimportant production systems including cereals, pulses, oilseeds, horticultural\ncrops, plantation crops and forestry. The production and productivity of crops in\nOrissa are low (Table 1) as compared to all India average due to both deficiency\nand toxicity of plant nutrients, low consumption of fertilizer and imbalanced use\nof fertilizer(Table 2).\n\n\n**Table 1** Productivity of different crops in Orissa as compared to all India (2004\n\nSource: Agricultural\ufffdStatistics\ufffdof\ufffdOrissa\ufffd2008\n\n\n**Table\ufffd2** Fertilizer\ufffdconsumption\ufffdrate\ufffdand\ufffdratio\ufffdof\ufffdN\ufffdand\ufffdK\ufffdin\ufffdOrissa\n\n|Year|N+P O + K O (kg ha -1)<br>2 5 2|N: K O ratio<br>2|\n|---|---|---|\n|1980<br>1990<br>2000<br>2005-06<br>2006-07<br>2007-08|7.6<br>21.0<br>31.0<br>46.0<br>52.0<br>57.0|5.9<br>5.1<br>6.7<br>5.8<br>4.9<br>4.4|\n\n\n\nSource: Agricultural\ufffdStatistics\ufffdof\ufffdOrissa\ufffd2008\n\n\n**Mineralogy\ufffdof\ufffdsoils**\n\n\nImportant K bearing minerals in soils of Orissa are muscovite, biotite and feldspar.\nRelease of K to crops depends on the nature of dominating K bearing mineral. On\n\n\n\n0 / 0 /\n\n\n\n418 419\n\n\nthe basis of K release power, the minerals are arranged in the order of: biotite >\nmuscovite > orthoclase > microcline. The inherent status of K in soils of Orissa is\n\nmainly governed by the soil mineralogy. The microcline is the most common Kfeldspar in the soils of Orissa (Sahu et al. 1995). InAlfisols, orthoclase constituted\n9.8 to 41.1% while muscovite mica from nil to 6.1% (Table 3). The presence of\nhigh content of light minerals (orthoclase feldspar) in fine sand fractions may be\nattributed to moderate weathering in the environment. High temperature with\nalternate wet and dry season in humid sub-tropical climate of Orissa are also\nconducive for development of illite in the clay fractions due to alternation and\npartial hydrolysis of feldspar and mica (Sahu et al. 1983). The occurrence of\nKaolinite in these soils is also expected due to leaching of bases. In the Inceptisols,\n\n\n**Table\ufffd3** Mineral\ufffdcomposition\ufffdof\ufffddifferent\ufffdsoil\ufffdorders\ufffdof\ufffdOrissa\n\n|Location|Classification|Orthoclase<br>(%)|Mica<br>Muscovite<br>(%)|Clay<br>mineralogy<br>in order of<br>abundance|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Alfisols|Alfisols|Alfisols|Alfisols|Alfisols|\n|Phulbani<br>Bhubaneswar<br>Khurda<br>Semiliguda<br>Suakati<br>Muktapur|Oxic Paleustalfs<br>Rhodic Paleustalfs<br>Ferric Plinthustalfs<br>Oxic Paleustalfs<br>Ultic Paleustalfs<br>Lithic Plinthustalfs|24.6<br>41.1<br>37.6<br>9.8<br>31.0<br>15.4|6.1<br>-<br>-<br>1.9<br>-<br>-|I,K<br>I,K<br>I,K<br>K,I<br>K,I<br>I,K|\n|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|\n|Bhubaneswar<br>Shymakhunta<br>Ranital<br>Motto<br>Keshpur|Eutrochrepts<br>Aeric Ustochrepts<br>Typic Haplaquepts<br>Vertic Haplaquepts<br>Typic Haplaquepts|16.0<br>30.5<br>7.0<br>41.5<br>42.5|1.0<br>-<br>2.5<br>-<br>4.8|I,M,K<br>K,I,M<br>M,I,K<br>K,I,M<br>M,C,I,K|\n|Entisols|Entisols|Entisols|Entisols|Entisols|\n|Jasuapur<br>Kendrapara<br>Chilika<br>Astaranga|Typic Ustifluvents<br>Typic Usterthents<br>Prammaquents<br>Typic Haplaquents|27.1<br>33.0<br>22.5<br>38.6|14.8<br>1.1<br>3.1<br>4.3|I,M,K<br>I,M,K<br>K,I,M<br>M,I,K|\n|Vertisols|Vertisols|Vertisols|Vertisols|Vertisols|\n|Bhawanipatwana<br>(Arkabali)<br>Luisinga|Ustalfic Pellusterts<br>Typic Pellusterts|26.9<br>12.4|11.0<br>2.7|I,M<br>M,I|\n\n\n\nI\ufffd=\ufffdIllite,\ufffdK=\ufffdKaolinite,\ufffdM=\ufffdMontmorillonite,C=Chlorite\nSource\ufffd:\ufffdSahu\ufffdet\ufffdal.\ufffd1995\n\n\n\northoclase content varies 7 to 42.4 %. Except Shyamakhunta and Motto (saline\nsoil), mica content varies between 1.0 to 4.8 %. These soils in general are, neutral\nto slightly alkaline and have high base saturation capacity with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+\ndominating in the exchange complex. These conditions are favorable for the\nformation of smectites in the clay fractions (Sahu et al. 1983). Alternation of Kfeldspar might have led to the formation of illite in clays. The Entisols are found in\nDelta area of Orissa due to deposition of silt and clay by the action of flood and\ncontained higher amount of orthoclase (27.1 to 38.6%) and mica (1.7 to 17.4 %).\nHigh mica content in the sand fraction indicates lack of weathering and the soils\nare rich in K. High base saturation with mild acidic to neutral soil reaction must\nhave favoured formationof smectitesbesides illites(Sahu et al. 1990)\nThe orthoclase and mica inVertisols of Orissa varies between 12.4 and 26.9 %\n\nand between 2.7 and 11.0 %, respectively. Their transformation/alteration\naccounts for the occurrence of illite. Abundance of Ca and Mg 2+ 2+ in an alkaline\nenvironment favours the formation of montmorilonite in the clay fraction. Nayak\net al. (2001) analysed the fine sand fraction (0.1 to 0.25 mm) of Alfisols and\nInceptisols of university farm (OUAT) at Bhubaneswar and reported that quartz\ndominated (55.0 - 80.5 % ) the fine sand fraction along with K bearing minerals\nlike orthoclase feldspar (9.5 -31.0 %), biotite and muscovite mica (0.5 -2%). The\nAlfisols contained more K bearing minerals than the Inceptisols (Table 4). In fine\nsand fraction (0.1 -0.25 mm) of soils of Kanchinala micro watershed under coastal\nplains of Mahanadi delta of Orissa. Mishra (2008) observed a considerable\namount of K bearing minerals like orthoclase, muscovite and biotite in upland,\nmedium land and low land soils (Table 5). Higher amount of orthoclase was\npresent in low land (20.6%) followed by medium land (19.2%) and upland\n\n\n\n**Table 4** Mineralogy of fine sand fraction in the soils of Central Research Station,\n\n|OUAT, Bhubaneswar|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Mineral Species (%)|Orders|Orders|\n|Mineral Species (%)|Inceptisols|Alfisols|\n|Quartz<br>Orthoclase Feldspar<br>Andelusite<br>Garnet<br>Muscovite<br>Biotite<br>Zircon<br>Chlorite<br>Rutile<br>Opaque<br>Unidentified mineral|80.5<br>9.5<br>0.5<br>0.5<br>-<br>2.0<br>-<br>2.0<br>0.5<br>3.5<br>1.0|55.0<br>31.0<br>1.0<br>1.0<br>1.0<br>1.0<br>0.5<br>2.0<br>-<br>4.5<br>2.0|\n\n\n\nSource:\ufffdNayak\ufffdet\ufffdal.\ufffd2001\n\n\n\n2+ 2+\n\n\n\n2+ 2+\n\n\n\n420 421\n\n\n**Table\ufffd5** Mineralogy\ufffdof\ufffdfine\ufffdsand\ufffdfraction\ufffdof\ufffdKanchinala\ufffdmicro\ufffdwatershed\ufffdunder\ncoastal\ufffdplains\ufffdof\ufffdMahanadi\ufffddelta,\ufffdOrissa\n\n|Mineral Species (%)|Upland|Medium Land|Low land|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Quartz<br>Orthoclase<br>Plagioclase<br>Calcite<br>Muscovite<br>Biotite<br>Garnet<br>Hornblende<br>Opaque|64.2<br>16.5<br>4.8<br>0.3<br>3.5<br>2.8<br>2.2<br>1.5<br>3.0|61.4<br>19.2<br>5.2<br>1.6<br>3.0<br>2.2<br>1.8<br>1.2<br>3.5|59.3<br>20.6<br>5.0<br>2.0<br>2.8<br>2.3<br>2.0<br>1.2<br>4.0|\n\n\n\nSource:\ufffdMishra\ufffd2008\n\n\n(16.5%). On the other hand the content of muscovite and biotite was in the order of\nupland > mediumland > lowland.\nWeathering process is generally influenced by cationic environment,\nespecially the base saturation of clays. An alkaline environment favours the\nformation of montmorillonite while acidic environment favours the formation of\n\nkaolinite and Mg rich environment produces vermiculite. Release of organic acids\nthrough decay of plant roots by microbes accelerates the process of weathering. In\nlaterite soils under rice-rice cropping system (Pattanayak 1992) the allophane\ncontent was increased from 0.04 (initial value) to 0.048 in control, and 066 in\n150% NPK treatment. Lower content of allophane (0.012) was observed in fallow\ntreatment. Intensive cultivation of rice-rice cropping system for 18 years with\n100% NPK increased the illite content. The content of interstratified smectite was\n\nhigher in 100% NPK + FYM and illite with interstratified smectite in 150 % NPK\ntreatment(Table 6).\n\n\n**Table 6** Occurrence of clay minerals as affected by long term manure and\nfertilizer applications in rice-rice cropping system (expressed as dspacing in Mg saturationand glycolatedclay)\n\n|Treatments|14-17 A0|10.1-14 A0|10.1 A0|7.1 A0|4.26 A0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Control<br>100% NPK<br>100% NPK+FYM<br>150% NPK<br>Initial|27.5<br>29.5<br>35.0<br>36.2<br>35.5|27.0<br>30.3<br>33.6<br>14.7<br>28.7|19.1<br>16.2<br>11.5<br>18.9<br>13.8|27.4<br>24.0<br>19.2<br>29.7<br>23.4|0.8<br>-<br>0.7<br>0.6<br>0.6|\n\n\n\nSource:\ufffdPattnayak\ufffd1992\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdstatus**\n\n\nSoils of Orissa are considered as medium to high in available potassium. Coastal\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\nsaline soils are high in exchangeable-K (56.6 to 624 mg kg ) and water soluble-K\n(117 to 624 mg kg ). Alluvial soils have wide rage of K status. The extreme low -1\nvalues of exchangeable-K and percent K saturation in alluvial and red soils\nindicated the higher K removal from non-exchangeable sites under high cropping\nintensity. The total K\ufffdO content ranges from 0.30 to 1.20 % in laterite soils, 1.62 to 2\n6.03 % in mixed red and black soils, 0.68 to 2.41% in alluvial soils, and 1.77 to\n3.01% in coastal saline soils. Non-exchangeable K constitutes 21 to 64% of total\nK, highest being in alluvial soils where as the exchangeable K constitutes between\n12.5 to 35.7 % of total K. In rice-groundnut growing soils of Alhagarh in Cuttack\ndistrict (Pal et al. 2001) total K ranged from 950 to 2400 mg kg . Ammonium -1\nacetate extractable K constitutes 3 to 12%, non-exchangeable K 14 to 45% and\nlattice-K 48-80% of the total K. Total K content in surface soils of an watershed in\n\nKhajuripada block of Kandhamal district with rice-pulse cropping system varied\nbetween 1100 to 2600 mg kg (Das et al. 1997). Total K content increased with -1\ndecrease in elevation of the watershed. In all the three profiles (foot hill, mid\nupland and medium valley), water soluble K decreased whereas nonexchangeable, lattice K and total K increased with depth, probably due to increase\nin clay content. Lattice K constitutes 53 to 73 %, non-exchangeable and\nexchangeableK from 24.8 to 41.8 and 2.8 to 3.7 % of totalK, respectively.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Interrelationship\ufffdof\ufffdforms\ufffdof\ufffdK**\n\n\nExchangeable, non-exchangeable, lattice and total K of 21 alluvial soil samples\ncollected from rice-groundnut cropping system (Pal et al. 2001) and rice-pulse\ncropping system (Sahu 1994) in Badamba block of Cuttack district were\npositively correlated with each otherThe dynamic equilibrium was existed among\ndifferent pools and depletion of K from one pool is replenished from the other\npools of soil K.\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdtransformation**\n\n\nThe rate at which K is released from non-exchangeable sources is an index of the\nability of soil to supply K to crops. The rate and magnitude of release depend on\nthe level of K in soil solution and amount and type of clay minerals present in soil\n(Martin and Spark 1985).The contribution of release of non-exchangeable K to Kavailability has been reported by several workers (Sparks 2000, Parker et al. 1989\nb). The rate of release of non-exchangeable K is influenced by the degree of\nexposure of edges of clay minerals to the soil solution. In some soils the release of\nnon-exchangeable K may be slow and restrict crop yield, where as in some cases it\nmay be rapid to meet the K requirement of crops. The release kinetics of eight soil\nseries in Indo-Gangetic plain of India (Sekhon et al.1992) showed that Kaolinite\ndominated alluvial soils and smectitic acidic alluvial soils in lower Gangetic plain\n\n\n\n422 423\n\n\nshowed lower rate of K release from the non-exchangeable fraction than that of\nilliticalluvialsoils.\n\nIn rice-rice cropping system in Inceptisols and soyabean-wheat-cowpea in\nVertisols (Typic Haplusterts), the total K uptake by crops exceeded the amount of\nK applied. The plots which did not receive K fertilizer (control, N and NP\ntreatment) in soybean-wheat-cowpea system contributed K to the extent of 3129\nto 9932 kg ha from non-exchangeable source as against 1183 to 1891 kg ha in -1 -1\nrice-rice system. The results of LTFE trials clearly showed that mining of K\noccurred with N, NPand even with NPK application(Rupa et al. 2003)\nResults from two long term fertilizer experiments conducted at Bhubaneswar\nwith rice-rice cropping system and at Keonjhar with rice-oilseed/pulse cropping\nsystem representing two different agro-climatic regions of Orissa showed that in\nrice-rice cropping system there was sharp increase in available K in the first 10\nyears of cropping followed by a rapid fall between 1980-1983 and almost\nplateauing afterwards in all treatments except NPK+FYM treatment (Fig. 1).

The decrease in latter treatment might be due to relatively\nmuch higher cumulative uptake of K by crops associated with higher biomass\nyield.

He categorized rice soils with less than 1.5% K saturation as\nlow K, with 1.5\u20132.5% K saturation as medium K and with more than 2.5% K\nsaturation as high K soils. The K saturation of broad soil groups of Orissa were in\nthe order of: black soils (5.54%) > coastal saline soils (4.32%) > laterite soils\n(2.7%) > alluvial soils (2.35%).Although K saturation of Orissa soils come under\nhigh category, still good response to K application was recorded in alluvial and\nlaterite soils where as there was no response in coastal saline soils. However,\noptimum dose of K for crops in coastal saline soils is recommended to suppress Na\nuptake.\n\n\n**Contribution\ufffdof\ufffdsubsurface\ufffdK\ufffdto\ufffdplant\ufffduptake**\n\n\n\ncounter act to replace structural potassium (Kirk et al. 1993). This was observed in\nrice- rice system at Bhubaneswar due to decrease in total K in all the three layers\nover 15 years of cropping.\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdrelease\ufffdcharacteristics**\n\n\n\nst\n\n\n\n-1 th\n\n\n\nth\n\n\n\nSubsurface K contributes significantly to plant nutrition. The difference in\nmineralogy and K reserve in subsurface horizon influences the subsurface K\navailability. Results of 15 years of rice-rice cropping at Bhubaneswar revealed that\nalthough NH\ufffdOAC \u2013K of the surface layer was higher than the initial value, the sub 4\nsurface layers showed a lower status as compared to initial value. On the other\nhand, there was substantial decrease in 1N HNO\ufffd-K in all the layers indicating the 3\ncontribution of non exchangeable K towards K nutrition of crops. Similar findings\nwere also observed with respect to NH\ufffdOAc\u2013K and HNO \u2013K at Keonjhar after 10 4 3\nyears of cropping.\nThese results indicated that at Bhubaneswar NH\ufffdOAc\u2013K in different layers 4\nshowed very poor correlation with K balance. On the contrary significant\ncorrelation existed between HNO \u2013K of each layer and K balance (r=0.85**, 3\n0.72** and 0.74** for 0-0.15, 0.15-0.30 and 0.30-0.45m layer), respectively.\nAround 68% of the variation of HNO \u2013K of 0-0.15 m layer were accounted for K 3\nbalance. A measure of total K in all the three layers also shows a substantial\nvariation from the initial value. A drop in total K at the end of 1987-88 was many\ntimes higher than the decrease in NH\ufffdOAc\u2013K and HNO \u2013K indicating that 4 3\nweatherable K bearing minerals in surface and sub surface layers make a major\ncontribution to plant uptake K. Singh et al. (2002 b) reported that application of\norganic manures along with urea \u2013N increased the cumulative non \u2013 exchangeable\nK release and could maintain large amount of K in soil solution on exchange sites\nby reestablishing the equilibrium among different forms of K. In rice-rice\ncropping system at Bhubaneswar, NPK + FYM treatment encourage release of\nmore non \u2013 exchangeable K under acidic environment to meet crop requirement\nof K.Wihandjaka et al. (1999) observed that mobilization of non-exchangeable K\nin flooded rice is due to root induced acidification and removal of K from soil\n\n\n+\n\nsolution by roots. Under flooded rice ecosystem, release of hydronium ion (H\ufffdO ) 3\nfrom roots and decomposition of organic manures and plant residue, actively\n\n\n\nStep K provides estimation of K availability from the non\u2013exchangeable sources\nand constant rate K (CR-K) is a measure of difficulty available K of mineral lattice\nsource. The K release characteristics of 21 surface soil samples of laterite soils\nwith rice based cropping system revealed that step K was maximum in the 1 st\nextraction and varied from 150 to 700 mg kg and gradually decreased to zero in 6 -1 th\nand 7 extraction (Pal et al. 2001). Higher values of step K is associated with th\ngreater release of K from non\u2013exchangeable K under stress condition. The CR- K,\ntotal step K and total exchangeable K in soils varies between 12-56, 140-1332 and\n500-1592 mg kg . The correlation coefficient of K release parameter with -1\ndifferent forms of K showed that exchangeable, non\u2013exchangeable, lattice and\ntotal K were positively correlated with each other suggesting the existence of\ndynamic equilibrium among the different pools of K in soil. Highly significant and\npositive correlation between step K with HNO K indicates that HNO K could 3 3\nserve as a good index of plant available non\u2013exchangeable K in soil. In alluvial\nsoils with rice based cropping system, the step K was maximum in the 1 st\nextraction and varied between 104 and 1510 mg kg -1 and gradually decreased with\nincrease in number of extraction (Sahu 1994). Constant rate K (CR K) values\nvaried from 8 to 44 mg kg, which indicate adequate supply of lattice K to plants. -1\nThe total extractable K varied from 442 to 1792 mg kg soil. In a long term -1\nfertilizer experiment (LTFE) with rice-rice cropping system sequential stepwise\nextraction with boiling HNO 3 yielded two categories of K viz. CR K, released\nfrom mineral lattice at a fairly constant rate and step K released from edge and\nwedge zone of micaceous minerals, the amount of which was negligible after 3 rd\nextraction (Senapati 1993). There was little difference of CR K in different\ntreatments(Table 7).\nThere was a quite large difference in step-K. The NPK treatments recorded\nmuch higher step K values compared to NP treatments in all the three layers of\nsoil indicating their potentiality to release K for crop uptake. As compared to the\ninitial level, Step K declined by 55% in NP treatment in 0-15 cm layer. When both\nsurface and subsurface layers are taken into account, the decrease in Step K was\n45% in NP treatment, 4% in 150% NPK and 19% in 100% NPK treatment. The\ndecreasein 100% NPK +FYM was slightlymore (27%) due to higher crop uptake.\n\n\n**Crop\ufffdresponse\ufffdto\ufffdapplied\ufffdpotassium**\n\n\nBalanced use of fertilization enhances crop yield, crop quality, farm profit and\nmaintain soil health and crop productivity of the land.The grain yield of kharif rice\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n3 3\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nst\n\n\n\n4 3\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nHNO 3\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nrd\n\n\n\n4 3\n\n\n\n+\n\n3\n\n\n\n426 427\n\n\n**Table\ufffd7** Cumulative\ufffdeffect\ufffdof\ufffdtreatments\ufffdon\ufffdStep\ufffd-K\ufffdand\ufffdCR-K\ufffdafter\ufffd22\ufffdyears\ufffdof\nrice-rice\ufffdcropping\ufffdat\ufffdBhubaneswar\n\n\n\nIn acidic Inceptisols of Bhubaneswar, complete exclusion of K resulted in 74\n% loss in yield and highest chaff production of hybrid rice (Table 8).

However, at super-optimal level (150% NPK) the K\ndepletion was decreased to 41.0 and 26.0 kg ha in rice \u2013 green gram and rice- -1\ngroundnut cropping system, respectively(Fig. 5, 6).\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Management of potassium**\n\n\n\nSoil type, mineralogy, K fixation, amount and leaching loss of K should be\nconsidered while fixing the dose of K for different crops. Potassium fixation\nstudies have revealed that soils become more hungry for K fixation with the\ncontinuation of negative balance. Illite soils fixed 23-29% of applied K, kaolinite\nand smectite soils 17-23% and 26-32%, respectively (Srinivas-Rao et al. 2000).\nMaintenance of shallow surface submergence in rice-rice cropping system in soils\ncontaining 2:1 clay minerals may increase K fixation and reduce solution K, thus\nincreasingthe rice dependenceon non-exchangeablereserve for K uptake.\nLeaching losses of K is a major concern under frequent intense rainfall\nconditions in well drained soils of humid tropics. Leaching tends to be a problem\nin soils with low CEC. The leaching losses of K in loam and sandy loam profiles\nunder submerged moisture regime were 22 and 16% of applied K, respectively\n(Singh et al. 2004). Therefore, either K application level should be increased by\n25-50% or the rice residues, which contain huge quantity of K (88-92% of total\nuptake), be recycled in the soil. Even burning of rice straw in field is a better option\nthan its removal (Prasad 2007). Split application of K in the ratio of 1:1 at peak\ntillering and PI stage is recommended to rice to reduce the chaff percent and\nincreasetest weight.\n\n\n-1\n\nGenerally application of N, P\ufffdO and K O @ 20:40:40 kg ha is recommended 2 5 2\n\n\n-1\n\nfor groundnut in most of the soils of Orissa.Application of 40 kg K\ufffdO ha with NP 2\nto summer groundnut grown on the lateritic soils of Bhubaneswar significantly\nincreased yield from 10.60 q ha -1 to 15.88 q ha . Benefits of use of potassic -1\nfertilizers on pulses were also observed in the K deficient Balisahi series. Green\n\n\n-1\n\ngram yield was significantly increases due to application of 30 kg K\ufffdO ha . The 2\nrecommended application (100% NPK) to rice \u2013 pulse and rice \u2013 oilseeds\ncropping system recorded highest yield and benefit:cost ratio. There was\nsignificant response to super optimal dose (150%) of NPK in alluvial and laterite\nsoils having medium to high organic carbon status. Basal application of K @ 40 kg\nha at sowing is recommended for pulse crops in Orissa. Split application of K in -1\nthe ratio of 1:1:1 at planting, 30 and 60 days after planting is recommended for\nvegetable crops like cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, tomato and spices like chilli.\nBasal application of 30 kg K ha for mustard and 60 kg K ha for sunflower is -1 -1\nrecommended for higher yield and oil content. Integrated application of K with N,\n\n\n\nPand FYM improve the nutrient use efficiency and yield and hence recommended\nfor higher profit.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\nThe mining of K will limit crop yield and it may not be possible to maintain the\npresent production. Results of long term fertilizer trials with rice-rice and ricepulse cropping systems indicated that gradually the magnitude of response to\napplied K increased as K becomes limiting factor.Application of FYM, recycling\nof crop residues and green manuring can help to improve K balance in different\ncropping systems. Significant correlation of HNO\ufffd-K with K balance and yield 3\nsuggest its inclusion in soil testing laboratories. K balance in different cropping\nsystems, based on precise data on K removal, K inputs from irrigation water or rain\nwater, straw recycling besides fertilizers and manures needs to be worked out.\nStraw management can strongly influence K budget and can help in efficient\nmanagement of K for a sustainable cropping systems in different regions. A\nsustainable fertilizer management strategy must ensure the farm productivity,\noptimumeconomicreturn without deteriorationof agriculturalenvironment.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nDas PK, Sahu GC, Das N (1997)Vertical distribution and release characteristics of\npotassium in some lateriticsoils of Orissa.

Rye grass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) based rotations on a loamy\nsand derived from granitic bedrock were studied over 30 years with two Kfertilisation regimes, nil (K0) and 65 kg K ha yr . Mineralogical and chemical -1 -1\nmethods were combined to identify and quantify soil K resources including the\npartitioning of K between minerals. Two or three cuts were taken annually and\nherbage yield and composition together with exchangeable soil K were analysed.\nHerbage yield declined with time and significantly reduced when the K\nconcentrations approached 1%. The grass K concentration also declined over time\nand stabilized at around 0.5-0.7% (dw) in K0 in all cuts. Input-output mass\nbalances showed an accumulated net K off-take (deficit) of 1100 kg ha, i.e. 35 kg -1\nha yr . With an exchangeable K pool of 100 kg ha (in the rooting zone 0-40 cm) -1 -1 -1\nthis indicated a substantial release of K from mineral sources, most probably\nbiotite and hydrobiotite. Assuming a similar net off-take was continued then this\nparticular mineralogical K source would be depleted within two centuries. The\nstudy illustrates the strength of combining long-term field experimental data with\nstate of the art quantitative mineralogical methods in order to assess site-specific\nresources which can form a basis to evaluate the sustainability of different\nmanagementpractices.\n\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\n\n_Lolium perenne_\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1 -1\n\n\n\n**Keywords** Depletion \ufffd perennial ryegrass \ufffd potassium release \ufffd soil minerals\n\nweathering\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\nI \u00d6born AC Edwards SHillier \ufffd \ufffd\n\nMacaulayInstitute,Craigiebuckler,AberdeenAB158QH,UK\nI \u00d6born\n\nDep.

While much emphasis has been given to quantifying\nnitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances at geographical scales ranging from\nfield to nation, similar calculations are not generally reported for potassium (K).\nOne notable exception is Foy et al. (2002). A lack of any obvious environmental\nconcerns associated with a K surplus is probably the main factor responsible for\nthis omission. This general situation is changing due to factors such as the\nincreased price of agricultural inputs including K fertilisers. Evidence for a\ndecline in soil K status has been provided through the regular monitoring of\nagricultural soils in England and Wales (Goulding and Loveland 1986; Skinner\nandTodd 1998) where both regional and temporal trends in soil extractable K were\ndescribed for the previous 25 years. There was some indication for a wider decline\nin K status, particularly evident for grassland, with 20% of all fields sampled in the\nNorthern region having a low K status (index 0). Declining rates of K fertiliser\ncoupled with manure applications determined on the basis of their N content has\nresulted in a wide ranging annual K balance within cropping systems of NW\nEurope (e.g. Askegaard and Eriksen 2002; Alfaro et al. 2003; Berry et al. 2003;\nKayser and Isselstein 2005; \u00d6born et al. 2005a, b). Also in other geographical\nregions negative K balances in agricultural production systems have been reported\nurging for intensified research efforts on K management and dynamics in different\nsoil types, climatic regions and cropping systems (e.g. Bedrossian and Singh\n2004; Bell et al 2009). Greatly increased crop yields and nutrient off-take in\nharvested products have exacerbated this situation. Losses of K can also be\nassociated with home produced forage crops and recycling of manure/urine (e.g.\n\u00d6born et al. 2005b; Gustafson et al. 2007), and/or where excessive leaching occurs\nfrom coarse textured soils (e.g. Wulff et al. 1998; Askegaard and Eriksen 2008).\nWithin systems managed organically negative K field balances have also been\nreported (e.g. Watson et al. 2002; Askegaard et al. 2003; Bengtsson et al. 2003),\nand there is a growing concern about net off-take of K and how to sustain the soil\nfertility, harvest level and crop quality (e.g. Fortune et al. 2005). Export of\nnutrients accompanies the sale of all agricultural produce and inherent sitespecific soil properties such as mineralogy and texture coupled with climatic\nfactors and farming system determine the likely long-term significance of any\npotential K deficiency (e.g. Heming 2004;Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007; Simonsson\net al. 2007; Barr\u00e9 et al. 2008; 2009).\nThe significant contribution that soil minerals can make to plant available K\nmeans that this aspect should also be considered in addition to fertiliser and\nmanure inputs. While lack of total soil K (Tot-K) reserves (organic soils being an\nexception) is not often an issue, it is possible that short-term deficits of plant\n\n\n\navailable K, for example, during the later part of the pasture growing season may\noccur (e.g. Brady and Weil 1996). During these times the rates of exchange\nbetween various soil K sources need to be considered. Various soil K pools have\nbeen defined as, soil solution K, exchangeable K, fixed or non-exchangeable K\nbound in the inter-layer positions, e.g. of weathered micas, vermiculites etc., and\nfinally structural K particularly associated with micas and K-feldspars (e.g.\nSparks and Huang 1985; Sparks 1987; Huang 1989; Robert 1992). The dynamic\nsituation that exists between the K pools determines the plant available K and is\namong other things influenced by plant properties such as root density and rooting\ndepth (e.g. Haak 1981; Kuhlmann 1990; Witter and Johansson 2001), climatic\nconditions (soil temperature and moisture) (e.g. Holmqvist et al. 2003), soil\nattributes (organic acids, pH, particle size distribution etc) as well as type of K\nbearing minerals (e.g.Wilson 1992; 2004; Hinsinger and Jaillard 1993; Barr\u00e9 et al.\n2007; 2008) and management practices (e.g. Singh and Goulding 1997;\nSimonsson et al. 2007).\nThis paper describes the long-term soil-plant K dynamics for a grass ( _Lolium_\n\n_perenne_ L.) based rotation growing on a loamy sand soil derived from granitic\n\nbedrock. Treatments without or with annual fertiliser K additions are compared\nover a 30 year period and the system sustainability including the plant\nperformance and K delivering capacity of the soil parent material are considered.\nIt was hypothesised that K-bearing soil minerals could supply sufficient K to\nmaintaingrass herbage production in low input systems.\n\n\nThe specificobjectiveswere to:\ni) Assess the annual and within year performance of herbage biomass\nproduction and K concentrationof ryegrass herbage;\nii) Establish annual and long-term K input-output mass balances in order to\nidentifymajorsources and sinks and assess temporaltrends;\niii) Study trends in plantavailable(aceticacidextractable)K, and\niv) Quantify individual chemical and mineralogical soil K pools in order to\ndeterminetheir potentialcontributionsto long-termplant availableK.\n\n\n**Materialsand Methods**\n\n\nSite and soil description\n\n\n\nThe experimental site was located on Macaulay Institute grounds at\nCraigiebuckler (57 8'N, 2 9'W), Aberdeen, NE Scotland. The mean annual o o\naverage temperature and rainfall were 7.9 o C and 791 mm, respectively (1961-80;\nDyce airport 57 12'N, 2 12'W) (Broad and Hough 1993). Precipitation was o o\nmeasured on the experimental site 1968-95 and the monthly averages were used\nwhen evaluating the uptake rates. The average growing season (6 C) in the area o\n\n\n\no o\n\n\n\no C\n\n\n\no o\n\n\n\no\n\n\n\n438 439\n\n\nwas 215 days (s.d. 14 days) lasting from 8 April to 10 November (Broad and\nHough 1993).\nThe soil was classified as Dystric Cambisol (FAO) or Typic Fragiorthod (Soil\nTaxonomy) (Adamo et al. 1998). According to Scottish terminology it is a freely\ndraining iron humus podsol developed in glacial till derived from granitic bedrock\nand it belongs to the Countesswells Association and Dess Series (Glentworth and\nMuir 1963). Soil and profile characteristics of the experimental site are given in\nTable 1.\n\n\nExperimentaldesign\n\n\n\nThe field experiment was established in 1968 and had a randomised block design\nwith two K treatments, K65 which received 65 kg K ha yr (as KCl) and K0 which -1 -1\nreceived no K, and five replicates.Three experimental phases could be defined; an\ninitial 12 year period of grass (Grass I, two cuts per year) followed by 6 years with\ncereals (Cereal), and a final 11 years of grass (Grass II, three cuts per year). The\ntiming of the cuts, i.e. the growth stage of the grass, was set to mimic the hay/silage\ncuts by farmers. During the two grass periods the K65 plots received fertiliser\nannually during the spring. All plots also received a basal N (50 kg N ha yr ) -1 -1\ndressing as nitrochalk at the start of the growing season and after each cut, i.e. in\ntotal 100 kg N ha yr for Grass I and 150 kg N ha yr for Grass II. During the six- -1 -1 -1 -1\nyear cereal period a similar annual basal N, P and K dressing was applied to all\nplots (75-85 kg N, 19-21 kg P and 63-74 kg K). The cropping sequence therefore\nconsisted of perennial ryegrass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) established in 1969 (Grass I)\nand 1987/88 (Grass II) with the cereal phase consisting of four years of spring\nbarley ( _Hordeum vulgare,_ L.), one year of oats ( _Avena sativa_ L.), and one year of\nwinter wheat ( _Triticum aestivum,_ L.).\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1 -1 -1\n\n\n\n_Lolium perenne_\n\n\n\n_Hordeum vulgare,_ L.), one year of oats ( _Avena sativa_\n_Triticum aestivum,_ L.).\n\n\n\nSamplingand sample treatment\n\n\nResponsibility for sample collection and analysis changed over the 30 year\nexperimental period, however, protocols were all well documented and analytical\ndataconsistentlyrecorded.\n\n\n_Plantsampling and preparation_\n\n\n\nTotal herbage biomass yield was recorded at each cut, and a sub-sample taken for\ndry matter determination and chemical analyses. All remaining herbage was\nremoved from the field to simulate a hay/silage situation. Prior to digestion and\nchemical analyses herbage samples were dried at 60 C and milled. For cereals, the o\ngrain weight was recorded and sub-samples taken and prepared for analysis.

For budget calculations the straw weight was estimated\nusing a grain:straw ratio of 1:1 (Hanson 1990). In two years, 1981 (grass) and 1985\n(barley), the plots were cut and cleared but no yield recorded, on these occasions\nthe average K removal from grass 1978-80, and barley 1982 and 84, were used in\nbudget calculationsas estimatesfor 1981 (grass) and 1985 (barley), respectively.\n\n\n_Soil sampling and sample preparation_\n\n\nSurface soil (0-15 cm) was collected annually in the autumn (after the last herbage\ncut) 1968 to 1987 when approximately 10 sub-samples were taken from each plot\nwith a screw auger. InApril 1998 (before the fertilisation), soil samples were taken\nfrom three surface horizons, 0-5 cm (Ap1), 5-15 (Ap2) and 15-25 cm (Ap3), and\none subsurface horizon within the rooting depth (B, 25-40 cm). When possible\n(only in 5 plots because it was very stony), the BC-horizon (40-60 cm) was\nsampled.Within each plot 20, 10, 10 and 5 sub-samples were taken from 0-5 cm, 515, 15-25 cm, and 25-40 cm depths respectively.Acore sampler was used for the 025 cm samples and a screw auger for the 25-60 cm depth. The C-horizon (60-80\ncm) was also sampled in three soil pits located immediately adjacent to the\nexperimental plots. In total 0.5-1 kg soil per plot and horizon was taken. The soil\nwas sieved fresh at 2 mm and air-dried at 30 C prior to the analyses. The o\nmineralogical analyses were carried out on pooled composite samples from the\ndifferent horizons.\n\n\n_Soil bulk density_\n\n\nThe bulk density for each soil horizon was determined in the three soil pits\n(0.5*0.5*0.5 m). All soil from each horizon was removed, and the volume of the\nremoved horizon was carefully measured in the soil pit. The soil was air dried,\nsieved and the <2mm fraction weighed and its bulk density calculated for each\nhorizon. The average values from the three profiles (Table 1) were used in the\ncalculationand expression of soil K dataon an aerialbasis.\n\n\nPlant and soil analyses\n\n\n_Plantanalyses_\n\n\nThe crop samples were wet-digested and K was analysed by flame photometry\n(1969-88) or ICP-AES (1989-1998). The straw K concentration measured in 1987\nin the K0 and K65 treatments, respectively, were used as general estimates for the\nstraw K concentration in the two treatments. The weighted annual average K\nconcentrations were calculated for the grass cuts and used in graphs and budget\n\n\n\ncalculations.\n\n\n_Soil analyses_\n\n\n\nAcetic acid extractable-K (Ac-K) was determined annually on soil collected from\nindividual plots between 1969 and 1987, and then in 1990, 1991 and in 1998.Airdried soil (2.5 g) was extracted by 100 ml 2.5% acetic acid (MISR/SAC 1985) and\nK was analysed by flame photometry (1969-88) or ICP-AES (1988-1998). In\naddition, a subset of samples (n=10) were extracted with 1 M ammonium acetate\n(NH\ufffdAc pH 7) (Rowell 1994) and analysed by ICP-AES in order to relate theAc-K 4\nextraction to an internationally frequently used extraction for exchangeable K.\nAcetic acid (2.5%) extracted on average 94% of 1 M NH\ufffdAc andAc-K will in this 4\npaper be used as a proxy for exchangeable K. Aqua-regia K (Aq-K) was extracted\nby 3:1 50% HCl:conc. HNO (by volume) (McGrath and Cunliffe 1985; McGrath 3\n1987) and analysed by ICP-AES. Total-K (Tot-K) was determined by X-ray\nfluorescence (XRF) using a Philips PW 1404 spectrometer and the methods by\nNorrish and Hutton (1969) for sample fusion and corrections for interelement\neffects.\n\nFor determination of the mineralogical composition 3 g soil (<2 mm) was\nground in an agate McCrone mill for 12 min with 9 g of liquid (0.5% polyvinyl\nalcohol and 2 drops of octanol) and spray dried as per Hillier (1999). X-ray powder\ndiffraction (XRPD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5000 instrument from\n\n2-75\u00b02\u03b8 using Cobalt K\u03b1 radiation, in 0.02\u00b0 steps counting for 2 seconds per step.\nThe resulting XRPD patterns were quantified by full-pattern fitting as described in\ndetail by Omotoso et al.

After the break years with cereals no\nsignificant differences in biomass harvest for the first two years of Grass II were\napparent, but from the third year until the end of the period the K65 plots showed a\nsignificantly higher yield (Fig. 1a).

In the K65 treatment, herbage K concentration was\nhighest (1.5%) in cut 1, decreasing to 1.1 and 1.0 % in cut 2 and 3, respectively\n(Table 3). Herbage K concentration was low (0.7 %) in K0 and remained similar\nthroughout the growing season.An estimate of daily K 'uptake rate' was calculated\nfor individual cuts and it declined substantially from the first to the third cut in both\nK65 and K0 (Table 3). The uptake rate of K was always greater for K65 than K0\nand the decline was larger in K65 as compared to K0. The K uptake rate was not\nsignificantly related (with simple linear regression) to the accumulated\nprecipitation during the growth period (roughlyApril-May for cut 1, June-July for\ncut 2 andAugust-September for cut 3) (data not shown).\n\n\n\ngrass phases was 140 and 180 t ha for K0 and K65, respectively, or 7 and 9 t ha yr \n1 if expressed on averageannual bases.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n_Herbage K concentrations_\n\n\nThe annually averaged herbage K concentration decreased significantly in K0 and\nK65 treatments during both Grass I and II periods (Fig. 1b).The K65 herbage had a\n\n\n\n446 447\n\n\nPotassium off-take and K input-outputmass balances\n\n\n_Annual K removal and net off-takeby biomass harvest_\n\n\n\nThe total amount of K removed annually in the harvested biomass declined with\ntime but was always significantly greater for any given year in the K65 treatment\ncompared to the K0 treatment (Fig. 1c). The annual net K off-take was calculated\nas the fertiliser derived input minus the K removed in harvested biomass (Fig. 1d).\nDuring the first two years of Grass I the deficit was large, being more than 100 kg\nK ha yr (Fig. 1d). Thereafter crop removal exceeded fertiliser application by 55- -1 -1\n70 kg K ha yr during a five year period, followed by four years with a smaller net -1 -1\nK off-take of around 30 kg ha yr . There was generally no significant difference -1 -1\nin net off-take between the K0 and K65 plots during Grass I. Grass II showed a\nsimilar pattern with a net off-take between 90 and 100 kg K ha yr the first year, -1 -1\nthereafter 55-85 kg ha yr for two years, and 40 kg ha yr during the final years -1 -1 -1 -1\n(Fig. 1d). There was no significant difference in net off-take between K0 and K65\nfor six years of Grass II.\n\n\n\n**Table 4** Annual K mass balances, kg K ha yr, for the three periods: (i) 11 years of -1 -1\ngrass (Grass I, 1970-80), (ii) 6 years of cereals (Cereals, 1982-87), and\n(iii) 9 years of grass (Grass II, 1989-97).The years when the rye grass was\nestablishedwere not included(1969, 1988)\n\n\n\n|Treatment|Inputs<br>Deposition|K-fertiliser|Outputs<br>Leaching|Harvest|Inputs-Outputs<br>Deficit/Surplus|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Grass I<br>K0<br>K65<br>Cereals<br>K0<br>K65<br>Grass II<br>K0<br>K65<br>a<br>a|1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4|0.0<br>65.0<br>62.6<br>73.5<br>0.0<br>65.0|0.8<br>2.3<br>0.8<br>2.3<br>0.8<br>2.3|66.6<br>128.4<br>47.8<br>62.9<br>47.7<br>119.9|-66.0<br>-64.3<br>+15.4<br>+ 9.7<br>-47.0<br>-55.7|\n\n\na During the period with cereals a basal NPK dressing was applied, except for\n\n1987 when the 0 and 65 kg K treatmentswere applied\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1 -1 -1\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\n_Input-outputK mass balances_\n\n\n\nThe input-output mass balance calculations for the entire period showed an annual\nK deficit during the two grass periods (Grass I and Grass II) and a surplus during\nthe 6-years of cereals (Table 4). During Grass I, an average of 67 kg K ha yr was -1 -1\nremoved by herbage from the K0 plots whereas 128 kg K ha yr was removed -1 -1\nfrom the K65 plots. This resulted in K removal in the herbage greatly exceeding\nthe amount added as fertiliser and resulted in an annual deficit of about 65 kg K ha \n1, a value that was similar for both treatments. During Grass II the annual K\n\nremoval by herbage averaged 48 and 120 kg K ha for the K0 and K65 treatments, -1\nrespectively, and the K mass balance calculation showed an average deficit of 47\n(K0) and 56 (K65) kg K ha yr . The cereal crops all received K fertiliser, on -1 -1\naverage 63 (K0) and 73 (K65) kg K ha yr, and during that period the annual K -1 -1\nsurplus was 15 (K0) and 10 (K65) kg K ha yr (Table 4). -1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboth treatments, but the K0 plots overall showed a lowerAc-K than the K65 plots.\nA very dry summer could be a possible explanation for the high Ac-K\nconcentrations recorded by the end of the 6 year of Grass I (1976).Ac-K was only th\ndetermined on three occasions during Grass II, with the final sampling taking\nplace in spring, and although based on very few observations the concentrations\nappeared to be at similar (or lower) levels to those measured during the Grass I\nphase.\n\n\n_Soil K turnover rates_\n\n\nThe replenishment of the Ac-K pool in the topsoil (0-15 cm) was estimated for\nGrass I where annual data for net off-take (Fig. 1d) and Ac-K (Fig. 2) were\navailable. Replenishment was estimated based on two different assumptions (Fig.\n3); (1) all K (100%) in herbage was taken up in the top 15 cm, or (2) K was taken up\nproportional to the root distribution (Table 1), i.e. 63% in top 15 cm. With the first\nassumption, after the initial two years, the net K off-take was about double the\namount of the Ac-K for the following 5 year period, i.e. the ratio was around 2\nduring this time, indicating that the Ac-K pool was replenished twice a year (Fig.\n3).The K0 was replenished somewhat quicker than K65, i.e. the ratio was 2.3 (K0)\nand 1.8 (K65). During the final 4 years, the net K off-take was of a similar quantity\nas theAc-K pool, i.e. the ratio was close to 1 (K0 1.1 and K65 0.8), indicating that\nthe Ac-K pool was replenished once per year (Fig. 3).

The long-term dynamics\nof Ac-K in the surface soil (0-15 cm) showed an annual variation but also a clear\ndifference between the years with grass compared to those with cereals, the Ac-K\nconcentration being lower under grass (Fig. 2).

Potassium\nconcentrations were compared within profiles as well as between the K0 and K65\ntreatments.Tot-K concentration was significantly higher in the B and BC horizons\nas compared to theAp horizons (Table 5).Asimilar pattern was apparent forAq-K.\nAc-K was significantly higher in both Ap1 horizons compared to other soil\nhorizons, and it was higher in the K65 treatment as compared to the K0 (Table 5).\nThe Aq-K fraction represented 16-20% of Tot-K in the Ap and Bs horizons\nwhereas it accountedfor 30% in the BC horizon.\n\n\n\n_Soil mineralogicalcomposition and partitioningof totalK in the solid phase_\n\n\nThe quantitative XRPD analyses showed that about 30% of the soil minerals\ncontained K, and these minerals were partitioned one third as K-feldspar and two\nthirds as 2:1 phyllosilicates (Table 7). The dioctahedral micas, muscovite and\nillite, were the main phyllosilicates (12-15%), but there were also considerable\namounts (5-9%) of trioctahedral mica (biotite) and hydrobiotite, a common\nweatheringproduct of biotite.\nThe partitioning of K amongst the identified mineral phases showed that on\naverage 55% of the K was allocated in the form of K-feldspar, 32% in dioctahedral\nphyllosilicates and 12% in trioctahedral biotite and hydrobiotite. The results also\nshow that there was more K held in micas in the Bs- and B/C-horizons as compared\nto the surface layers (Ap1-Ap3), and this was especially evident with respect to the\ntrioctahedralmicamineralsbiotiteand hydrobiotite(Table 8).\n\n\n\nThe quantities of K within the various extractable fractions were calculated\nfor the horizons of the K0 and K65 soil profiles. TheAq-K and Tot-K soil pools in\nthe main rooting zone (0-40 cm) approximated 13 000 and 72 000 kg K ha, -1\nrespectively (Table 6).

It is\nreadily apparent from both herbage yield and K compositional data that especially\nthe K0 treatment K became the growth limiting nutrient element. The coarse soil\ntexture (loamy sand) and granitic parent material also contributed to make this\nstudy relevant for large areas of (medium to lower productive) agricultural land.\nBy combining detailed soil profile sampling including both chemical and\nmineralogical analyses with these accumulated negative K balances (net K offtake) an attempt has been made to quantify the underlying mechanisms controlling\nK cyclingin this soil.\n\n\nPotassium\u2013 the limitingnutrientfor plantgrowth\n\n\n\nthe first few years of the experiment (and then appeared to have stabilized there).\nThis is a minor change in relation to the accumulated net off-take (deficit), leaving\n1100-1150 kg K ha unaccounted for (Table 9), that presumably has originated -1\nfrom fixed and mineral bound K sources and/or was taken up by roots in deeper\nsoil horizons (below 15 cm). Since the Ac-K pool in the rooting zone (0-40 cm)\nwas estimated at about 100 kg ha by the end of the experimental period (Table 6), -1\nthe main part of the K 'unaccounted' for can be assumed to have been released from\nthe non-exchangeable and structural mineral K pool. This means that in total 1100\nkg K ha has been released from these fractions over a 30 year period which -1\ncorresponds to about 35 kg K ha yr . -1 -1\n\n\n\ngrass herbage trials (dominated by timothy, _Phleum pratense_\n\n_Festuca pratensis_\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n_Lolium perenne_\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nWhile somewhat extreme, the zero (K0) and low (K65) fertiliser K treatment and\n\n\n\nHerbage K concentrations reached values as low as 0.5-0.7% in the K0 treatment\n(Fig. 1b), a value below that reported as the 'critical limit' for K in many previous\nfield studies (Whitehead 2000). First indications of a yield difference between\nK65 and K0 treatments occurred at herbage concentrations of ~ 1%. However, the\nspecies composition is an important factor to consider when determining the\ncritical K concentration and may explain some of the differences with published\nfindings. The analysis of herbage taken from individual cuts showed low K\nconcentrations (0.7%) all through the season in K0 whereas in K65 there was a\ndecline in K% with cut 3 reaching 1% (Table 3). The similar low herbage K\nconcentrations in K0 in all three cuts (Table 3) indicated that K probably was the\ngrowth limiting factor all through the season and thus 'testing' the systems limits in\nterms of K releasecapacity.\n\u00d8gaard et al. (2002) studied the effects of K-fertiliser application rates in\ngrass herbage trials (dominated by timothy, _Phleum pratense_ L., and meadow\nfescue, _Festuca pratensis_ L.), and found that on sandy soils low in K there was a\npositive yield response on addition of K fertiliser the second and third year where\ngrass K concentrations were 1.0-1.4%. Exhaustive cropping with perennial\nryegrass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) in a pot experiment, demonstrated that at\nconcentrations of 0.6-0.8% K (Ghorayshi and Lotse 1986) growth essentially\nceased. In long-term fertility trials (40 years) Andersson et al. (2007) found no\nyield reduction and maintained grass/clover herbage K concentration of ~2% in K\nnil plots on silty clay and clay soils. However, on sandy loam and loam soils\nherbage concentrations were generally less than 2% K, and, although it came\ndown to 1% in one case, no effects on yield were recorded. The studied plots were\nfertilised with N but not P or K, and possibly P had become the limiting element\nprior to K in these systems, not 'pushing' the K delivering capacity as hard as in the\nexperimentdescribed herein.\n\n\n\n454 455\n\n\nPlant availablesoil K\n\n\n\nAnnual K off-take and soil K pools\n\n\n\nExchangeable and soil solution K have often been considered readily available for\nplants (e.g., Sparks 1987), while fixed and structural K are less available (e.g., Pal\net al. 1999). The exchangeable K pool, usually extracted by ammonium acetate,\nammonium lactate, ammonium nitrate, acetic acid or similar, as used in soil tests\nfor fertiliser recommendations (e.g., Egn\u00e9r et al. 1960; Thomas 1982; Rowell\n1994; MISR/SAC 1985; MAFF, 1986), were replenished about 10 times during\nthe 30 year experiment (Tables 6 and 9), suggesting a lack of sensitivity in this\nmeasurement to reflect actual plant availability of soil K. This indicated that\nsubstantial amounts of \u201cnon-exchangeable\u201d K had been released during the\nexperimental period and made available for plant uptake. In fact, several\nstudies have shown that release of fixed or structural K can contribute significantly\nto plant supply (e.g., Sinclair 1979a; 1979b; Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007;\nSimonsson et al. 2007) and thus calling for a new approach to 'plant available K'.\nThe demand for sustainable use of natural resources, including K fertiliser raw\nmaterial (mined KCl and K\ufffdSO\ufffd) that has a rather limited distribution globally 2 4\n(regions such as Africa, Asia and Oceania have to rely on import) and rapidly\nincreasing prices of agricultural inputs are also pertinent in this regard (e.g.\nManning 2010).\nIn a K depleted soil the exchangeable K (i.e. Ac-K) concentration by the end\nof the growing season indicates a soil specific property to bind and release K; and\nwhereas in certain soil types the release rate of K is slow and will restrict yields\nmarkedly in other parent materials it will meet all crop needs (McLean andWatson\n1985). After some initial years, Ac-K in Grass I was on average 39 mg kg, -1\nwhereas in Grass II it was 28 mg kg (Fig. 2). The lower Ac-K in the autumn in -1\nGrass II might be due to the fact that three cuts were taken while in Grass I the grass\nwas cut only twice a year. This can be compared with the results of a pot\nexperiment with intensive rye grass cropping to reach K exhaustion on soils from\nthe same soil association (Sinclair 1979a) where the exchangeable K (average for\ntwo course textured granitic soils of the CountesswellsAssociation) was 34 mg kg \n1 when the soil was partly depleted (after 6-8 cuts, low yield level) and 26 mg kg in -1\n\nthe more depleted soil (after 9-12 cuts, growth virtually ceased). The similarity\nbetween the results from the field experiment and the pot trial indicates that the K\nrelease rate has been governed by the parent material of the soil and the plant-soil\nsystem. This includes a combination of soil mineralogy, particle size (or rather\nspecific surface area), rooting depth and density, efficiency in K uptake, etc., all\nfactors determining the soil solution K concentration and thus controlling the\ndiffusion of K e.g. from interlayer positions of micas (e.g. Newman, 1969;\nFanning et al 1989).\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1,\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 4\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the accumulated total K net-deficit was about 1100 kg K ha, i.e. on\naverage 35 kg K ha yr and the question arises as to how this can be related to -1 -1,\ndifferent K sources.TheTot-K soil concentrationswere rather high, 23-28 g K kg, -1\nas compared to 5-40 g K kg recorded in a range of Scottish agricultural soils -1\n(Andrist-Rangel et al. 2010) and 0.4-30 g K kg reported as a typical range in -1\nmineral soils globally (Sparks 1987). Thus the Tot-Kpool in the rooting zone was\nvery large (72 000 kg K ha ) indicating that the soil was very rich in mineral bound -1\nK.The chemically definedAq-K pool (0-40 cm) was 12 000 kg ha, which equated -1\nto 17% of the Tot-K. That can be compared to a study of Scottish grassland soils\nshowing an average extractability of 13% (9-17%, n=3) for similar soils\n(CountesswellsAssociation) (Andrist-Rangel et al. 2010).\nHowever, the type of K bearing minerals influence the potential rate of release\nthrough mineral weathering and thus plant supply. Of the K bearing minerals that\nwere identified in the soil, biotite is the one most prone to release K followed by\nhydrobiotite (e.g. Thompson and Ukrainczyk 2002). The estimated K pool in\nterms of these minerals showed that by the end of the 30 year period the rooting\nzone contained 8 000 kg K ha in the form of biotite and hydrobiotite. Assuming -1\nthat the C horizon is representative of the material the soil was derived from there\nwas originally 13 600 kg ha K in biotite and hydrobiotite (Table 8). Comparing -1\nthat to the present situation, the difference is 5600 kg K, which can be seen in\nrelation to the K off-take of 1100 kg during the last 30 years. A hypothetic\ncalculation of continued intensive grass production, with no or low K fertiliser\napplication and an annual net K off-take of 35 kg, would completely deplete the K\npresent in trioctahedral micas in a bit more than two centuries. Taking the relative\nroot distribution into account showing that most roots were in the top 25 cm the\n(84%, Table 1), where the K pool in biotite and hydrobiotite was 4100 kg K ha -1\n(Table 8), and applying the release (net-off take) rate of 35 kg K ha yr the K- -1 -1\nbiotite and -hydrobiotite pool would last for another 120 or 140 years assuming 84\nand 100% uptake from this soil layer.\nAlthough these are very rough estimates, the findings can be related to\nlaboratory studies of release mechanisms of interlayer K in micas. Newman\n(1969) found that micas release interlayer K by cation exchange and diffusion, a\nprocess that is governed by low solution concentration of K. The dioctahedral\nmicas were found to be less reactive than trioctahedral micas and thus required a\nconsiderable (two orders of magnitude) lower solution concentration of K to\nrelease interlayer K. The study by Newman (1969) also showed that the release\nrate of K was largely independent of the proportion of mica K being exchanged.\nApplying this conceptually to the results of the present study, it seems most likely\nthat the K delivering capacity in the experimental soil is regulated by grass uptake\n\n\n\n1 -1\n\n\n\n456 457\n\n\nof K from the soil solution and hence the release rate of interlayer K in\ntrioctahedral (biotite and hydrobiotite) micas, and that the release rate might\nremain at a similar level until most biotite and hydrobiotite is K depleted and\nthereafter change (decrease) drastically when dioctahedral micas (and K\nfeldspars) becomethe main K source for plants.\n\n\nEstimationof K releasefrom soil resources\n\n\n\nSimonsson et al. (2007) found that when receiving no K (or P, but N) for 40 years, a\nloamy sand soil released 8 \u00b1 10 kg K ha yr, whereas four other soils (sandy loams -1 -1\nto clays) had been releasing 40\u00b18, 45\u00b110, 51\u00b112, and 65\u00b17 kg K ha yr during the -1 -1\nsame period of time. This can be compared with the 35 kg K ha yr on average -1 -1\ntaken out from the loamy sand in this study.Asimplified view has been that the soil\nK release and fixation capacity is mainly related to soil texture, particularly the\nfine textured material. However, that is not fully supported by this study, or other\nrecent field studies (e.g., Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007; Murashkina et al. 2007),\nwhich have shown the importance of the mineralogical composition of coarser\nfractions, in particular the occurrence of biotite and hydrobiotite in the silt\nfraction. The main difference between the loamy sand in this study as compared to\nthe one studied by Simonsson et al. (2007) was the mineralogy and in particular the\npresence of biotite and hydrobiotite, in total accounting for 4-8% of the minerals in\nthe former but only 1-2% in the latter (Andrist-Rangel, 2008). Other differences\nwere numbers of years with grass or grass/clover herbage in relation to cereal\ncrops and the climate.\nIn order to predict the K weathering potential of different soils, soil\nmineralogy and other soil properties, cropping systems, management practices,\nclimate etc have to be taken into account and a modelling approach would be\nneeded. Some first attempts to apply the biogeochemical steady-state model\nPROFILE on some northern European agricultural soils were carried out by\nHolmquist et al (2003) who estimated K weathering rates of between 3 and 82 kg\nha yr . A comparison between K release estimates from net off-take based on -1 -1\nmass balance calculations (Table 9) and modelled weathering rates for the studied\nCountesswells soil showed, however, a large discrepancy between field based\nestimates and model predictions, 35 versus 5 (uncertainty range 2-16) kg K ha yr -1 -1\n(Holmquist et al. 2003). This difference is most likely related to a combination of\nfactors that include the small clay content and specific surface area of the soil,\nparameters that the PROFILE model is very sensitive to (e.g. Hodson et al. 1997).\nThere is also an issue as to how the weathering of micas is represented within the\nmodel in terms of chemical reactions (Warfvinge and Sverdrup 1992; Sverdrup\nand Warfvinge 1993) because diffusion controlled exchange of interlayer K might\nbe expected to be the dominant process in agricultural soils maintained at near\n\n\n\nneutralpH values (e.g. Fanning et al. 1989).\nAs mentioned earlier, there are orders of magnitude differences in critical K\nsolution activity between di- and tri-octahedral micas (Newman, 1969; Fanning et\nal. 1989), i.e. in soils with tri-octahedral micas (such as biotite) they will become\nthe main K source for plant supply in K depleted/low input systems. When\ninterlayer K in biotite has been released and dioctahedral mica (and/or K feldspar)\nbecomes the major K source the release rate will most probably decrease\nconsiderably since much lower solution concentrations of K are required for\ndiffusion. This means that the release of K from soil resources observed in this and\n\nother long-term experiments will not be constant over time or related to the total K\npool but very dependent on the types and amount of K bearing minerals, in\nparticularthe presence of tri-octahedralmicas.\nThe long-term field data obtained from this study in combination with the\nquantitative mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of the soil and data\nfrom the literature (e.g. controlled laboratory experiments) have demonstrated the\npotential and need for further developing an approach linking mechanistic and\nquantitative assessment of plant K uptake and release from mineral sources in\nagricultural systems including predictions of K weathering rates. The increasing\nprices of agricultural inputs such as fertilisers and the increasing awareness of\nlimited availability and uneven distribution of non-renewable resources\n(including soils) are reinforcing a better knowledge, use and management of sitespecific resources for developing and maintaining sustainable production systems\nwhich requires cross-disciplinary research linking up basic and applied sciences\nwithin biogeochemistryand agriculturalsciences.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\nThis study has shown that K became the growth limiting nutrient element all\nthrough the growing season 'pushing' the K release capacity of the soil. The plant\n(perennial rye grass) K concentration was lower (0.6-0.7%) than reported in most\nprevious field studies. The relation between the average annual K net-off take (35\nkg ha ) and the quantified exchangeable K pool (~ 100 kg ha ), often assumed to -1 -1\nrepresent 'plant available' K, illustrated that 'non-exchangeable' K had been\ncontinually released and made available for plant uptake. Hence, the perception of\n'plant available K' needs to be reassessed taking the dynamics of the soil K\nresource(s) into account. The accumulated net K off-take (1 100 kg ha during 30 -1\nyear) was higher than previously reported from coarse texture soils derived from\ngranitic parent material. The relatively high concentration of trioctahedral micas,\ni.e. biotite and hydrobiotite, was most probable the main K source. However,\nassuming a continued low input management system with similar net K off-take\nthese easily weatherable minerals would be depleted of K within two centuries,\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n458 459\n\n\nsomethingthat needs to be considered in land-use and nutrientmanagement.\nThe study illustrates the strength of combining long-term field experimental\ndata with state of the art quantitative mineralogical methods in order to assess sitespecific resources which can form a basis to evaluate the sustainability of different\nmanagement practices. It shows how long-term field experimental data can be\nutilized to obtain quantitative measures on the potential K release in low input\nsystems in different soil environments in order to better interpret K input/output\nfield mass balances, predict the long-term sustainability of different farming\npractices, and suggest possible land-use and management options. Including an\nintegrated modelling approach would be an important component to come further\nin research and implementation within this area. The increasing prices of\nagricultural inputs such as K fertilisers and the increasing awareness of limited\navailability of non-renewable resources are reinforcing a better knowledge and\nuse of site-specific resources for developing and maintaining sustainable\nproductionsystems.\n\n\n**Acknowledgements** JAM Ross, D Nelson and Y Cook for field and laboratory\n\nassistance.The long-term funding from Scottish Government Rural, Environment\nand ResearchAnalysis Department(RERAD) is acknowledged.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAdamo P, McHardy WJ, Edwards AC (1998) SEM observations in the backscattered mode of the soil-root zone of _Brassica napus_ (cv.

Fertilizer nutrients have played a major role in\nimproving crop productivity. During the period 1969-2008, food grain production\nmore than doubled from about 98 mt to a record 230 mt in 2007-08, while fertilizer\nnutrient use increased by nearly 12 times from 1.95 mt to more than 23 mt in 200708 (Rao 2009). Notwithstanding these impressive developments, food grain\n\n\nTSatyanarayana\nInternational Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), South India Programme, Flat No. 401,\nTejaswini Arcade, West Maredpally, Secunderabad \u2013 500 003 (Andhra Pradesh) India,\ne-mail:tsatya@ipni.net,\nRKTewatia\n\nThe Fertiliser Association of India, FAI House, 10 Shaheed Jit Singh Marg, New Delhi \u2013\n110 067 India\n\n\n466 467\n\n\n-1 which may aggravatein the coming years and need attention.\nIn India, state wise approaches to crop nutrient balances have been developed\nway back in 2001 considering the nutrient additions and removal data either from\n1998-99 or 1999-2000. Since then, the information on nutrient balances has not\nbeen updated. Furthermore, for making future estimations, information on current\nnutrient balances is highly essential. Therefore an attempt has been made in this\npaper to generate fresh information on nutrient balances in major agriculturally\nimportant states of India considering the recent statistics of nutrient additions and\nremovals as available from FAI (2008). Nutrient balance calculations in most of\nthe cases do not give real picture as they consider nutrient removal by crops and\naddition through fertilizers neglecting contribution from sources other than\nfertilizers such as organic manures, crop residues and stubbles, irrigation water\netc. However, in this paper, the authors have tried to overcome that limitation by\nconsidering nutrient additions through organic sources wherever possible from\nthe information available in the published literature. While calculating nutrient\nremoval by crops at the present production levels, emphasis has been made to\nconsider removal of nutrients by fruits and vegetables in all the states; tea, coffee,\njute, rubber and other plantation crops in states wherever applicable and the total\nproduction values have been multiplied with the nutrient uptake per tonne of\nproduce and arrived at removal figures. During the discussions on nutrient\nbalances in individual states, efforts have been made to compare the current\nscenarios with that of either 1998-99 or 1999-2000, the reason being the last\nnutrient balance studies were generated from the statistics of those years.\nEfficiencyfactors were involvedfor calculatingnet nutrientbalances.\n\n\n\ndemand is estimated to increase to about 300 mt yr by 2025 for which the country\nwould require 45 mt of nutrients (ICAR 2008). With almost no opportunity to\nincrease the area under cultivation over 142 m ha, much of the desired increase in\nfood grain production has to be attained through yield enhancement in per unit\narea productivity. To sustain production demands, the productivity of major crops\nhas to increase annually by 3.0 to 7.5 percent (NAAS 2006). Much of this has to be\nmet by increasing genetic potential and improved production efficiency of the\nresources and inputs like water and nutrients. In addition, the growing concern\nabout poor soil health and declining factor productivity or nutrient use efficiency\nhas raised concern on the productive capacity of agricultural systems in India.\nMajor factors contributing to the low and declining crop responses to fertilizer\nnutrients are (a) continuous nutrient mining due to imbalanced nutrient use, which\nis leading to depletion of some of the major, secondary, and micro nutrients like P,\nK, S, Zn, Mn, Fe and B, and (b) mismanagement of irrigation systems leading to\nserious soil quality degradation. Furthermore, such low efficiency of resources\nand fertilizer inputs has impacted the production costs with serious environmental\n\nconsequences.\nIntensive agriculture is continuously being practiced in most of the states of\nIndia and therefore, the problems of soil fertility exhaustion and nutrient\nimbalances are bound to occur. The ill effects of exhaustive cropping systems are\nreflected on production of succeeding crops. In order to maintain the optimum\nlevel of production, it is necessary to know the nutrient requirement of crops,\nfertility status of the soil and the amount of nutrient removal from the soil by crops.\nDuring 1999-2000, the crop removal of nutrients is estimated to be about 28 mt\nwhile the fertilizer consumption was only 18 mt with an annual nutrient gap of 10\nmt. Although a part of this nutrient gap is expected to be bridged from nonchemical sources like organic manures and biological processes, still there is a\ndistinct gap in nutrient removal and supply leading to nutrient mining from the\nnative soil posing a serious threat to long term sustainability of crop production\n(Hegde and Sudhakarbabu 2001). Furthermore, the country like India can hope to\nachieve and sustain the desired level of agricultural production in the long run only\nif we can bridge the gap between nutrient removal and addition. Therefore,\nunderstanding the present status of plant nutrient use and removal and the resultant\nnutrient balances in different states of the country with varied agro climatic\nconditions would enable us for undertaking the corrective measures to bridge the\nnutrient gap and help to maintain soil health and ensure the food and nutritional\nsecurity. Information on nutrient balances would also help in developing an\nunderstanding about the annual loss of nutrients from the soil and to devise\nnutrient management strategies for rational use of soil resource in sustainable\nmanner. It also gives insights into the level of fertilizer use efficiency and the\nextent to which externally added nutrients have been absorbed by the crop and\nutilized for yield production. It can also forewarn about nutrient deficiencies,\n\n\n\n**Nutrient balance scenario in majorstates of eastern India**\n\n\nAssam\n\n\n\nAssam has 4 m ha of gross cropped area of which 14.5 percent is irrigated. Major\nportion of the soils of the state are Inceptisols (49.3 percent), followed by Entisols\n(32.3 percent),Alfisols (12.3 percent) and Ultisols (6.1 percent).Amongst several\nsoil related constraints, high soil acidity especially in the uplands and transitional\nmedium lands limits nutrient availability to the crops. The principal crops grown\nare rice, jute, potato, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, sugarcane, fruits, tea etc and the\ncropping intensity of the state is around 145 percent. The share of area under food\ngrains to gross cropped area is 71 percent. A variety of cropping systems are in\npractice in the state. The current fertilizer use in the state is 57.3 kg ha consisting -1\n\n\n-1\n\nof 27.7, 14.6 and 15.0 kg ha N, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO respectively, the N:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO use 2 5 2 2 5 2\nratio being 1.8:0.9:1.0. The consumption of total fertilizer nutrients (N + P\ufffdO + 2 5\nK\ufffdO) during 2007-08 was 214 thousand ton. 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\n\n\n2 5\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n468 469\n\n\nNutrient balance scenario (Table 1) for the state ofAssam shows that the crop\nremoval being higher than that added, all the three NPK nutrients have a negative\nbalance. Nutrient mining is found to be to the tune of 0.113, 0.011 and 0.199 mt of\nN, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO, respectively. If the similar trend of mining of nutrient reserves is 2 5 2\nallowed to continue without replenishment, worsen situations would lead to\ndeterioration of soil health and decline in crop productivity. The soils of Assam\nbeing constrained with soil acidity, high phosphorus fixation, nutrient losses from\nsoil along with socio-economic problems, the state needs special attention on\nadequate application of plant nutrients in order to achieve targeted crop\nproduction. Integrated nutrient management, organic recycling and\n\n\n**Table 1** Nutrient additions, removal by crops and apparent balance in major\nstates of Eastern India\n\n\n\nAgriculture in Bihar is the only backbone to the overall development of state. It has\ntotal geographical area of 9.37 m ha. The net cropped area stands at 5.7 m ha, of\nwhich 61.1 percent is irrigated. About 89 percent of the total cropped area of the\nstate is under food grains and the current cropping intensity is 139.4 percent. The\nprincipal crops grown are rice, wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, and\nsugarcane along with large acreage under fruits.The state is divided into four agroclimatic regions. Three major soil groups are recognized as foothill soils in the\nnarrow strips of northern boundary, sedentary foot hill and forest soils in the\nsouthern boundary and remaining soils are dominantly of alluvial origin in the\nIndo-Gangetic plains. The current fertilizer use in the state is 162.8 kg ha -1\n\n\n-1\n\nconsisting of 125.5, 25.9 and 11.4 kg ha N, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO respectively, the 2 5 2\nN:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO use ratio being 9.9:2.2:1.0. While most of the nitrogen, phosphorus 2 5 2\nand potassium are applied through urea, DAP (46 percent P\ufffdO\ufffd) and MOP (60 2 5\npercent K\ufffdO) respectively, a healthy share of complex fertilizers also contributes 2\nto the totalNPK consumptionin the state.\nThe total NPK removal by selected crops appears to be 1.30 mt as against the\nfertilizer nutrient addition of 1.21 mt. Thus, a net NPK depletion of 0.09 mt was\nrecorded for the whole state (Table 1). The balance sheet indicates that the\nmaximum removal was recorded with K followed by N and P. Potassium balance\nin the state is negative and this is very much expected under the situations when the\npotash removals by crops is much larger than its addition through fertilizers and\nother sources. The nutrient use pattern in Bihar is confined to N and P and the K\nfertilization is by and large neglected in most of the cases.

Major soils of the state are alluvial and saline - sodic with problems of\nsalty waters in some parts. The principal crops grown are rice, wheat, pearl millet,\ncotton, sugarcane, mustard, chickpea, and potato. The share of area under food\ngrains to gross cropped area is 71 percent. A five-fold increase in food grain\nproduction during the last 35 years combined with inadequate and unbalanced\nnutrient supply has led to a large degree of soil nutrient 'mining' of all the essential\nplant nutrients. Farmers in Haryana apply generalized quantities of N, P and Zn\nand as a consequence, deficiencies of K and other nutrients are spreading in space\nand time.

Though the share of Haryana to all India 2 5 2\ngross cropped area is 3.2 percent but its share to all India consumption of NPK is 6\npercent.The share of potash to totalNPK consumptionis only 1.93 percent.\nThe nutrient mining scenario in Haryana reveals that there was a gap of 0.78\nmt between removal and additions of NPK nutrients through mineral fertilizers\nand other organic sources in the year 2007-08 (Table 2). Except for N showing a\npositive balance of 0.031 mt, both Pand K balances were found to be negative.The\nN gap in the state has been improved from -22.5 thousand tonnes in 1999-2000 to\n+30.8 thousand tonnes which was mainly due to increase in fertilizer consumption\nfrom 109.13 kg ha in 1999-2000 to 187.6 kg ha in 2007-08. There is a negative -1 -1\nbalance of about 155 and 652 thousand tonnes of P and K in the state, which\nindicate that the depletion of both Pand K would continue to increase in future, as a\nresult more and more areas will come under the deficiency of these nutrients.\nVinod Kumar et al. (2001) also reported a negative balance of S, Fe, Mn and Cu in\nthe state though the Zn balance was positive due to application of Zn in rice and\nwheat crops.

In Punjab, 95 percent of the gross cropped area is irrigated with\ncropping intensity of 194 percent. Major soils of the state are alluvial in nature.\nThe principal crops grown are rice, wheat, maize, cotton, sugarcane, mustard,\nchickpea, and potato. The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is\n77 percent. The total nutrient consumption in the state increased by 23.5 percent,\nfrom 1.38 mt during 1998-99 to 1.69 mt during 2007-08. The intensity of nutrients\n\n\n-1\n\n(N + P\ufffdO + K\ufffdO) use in Punjab is 210 kg ha consisting of 162.7 kg N, 42.5 kg P\ufffdO 2 5 2 2 5\nand 4.7 kg K\ufffdO with N:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO use ratio of 34.3:9.0:1 which evidently is highly 2 2 5 2\nunbalanced.Apparently, the share of potash in totalNPK use in the Stateis only 2.3\npercent,which is negligible.\nNutrient addition to crops is mainly through mineral fertilizers and the\ncontribution of organic sources is marginal in the state. It is evident from Table 2\nthat the N balance in the state is positive at 565 thousand tonnes. However, with the\ncurrent additions of 344 thousand tonnes of P\ufffdO as against 446 thousand tonnes of 2 5\ncrop removal, the P balance in the state is negative by 102 thousand tonnes. The\nuse of K in Punjab is almost negligible, whereas its removal is 36 and 129 percent\ngreater than that of N and P. The total K removal by the crops at current level of\nproductivity is 1.022 mt against total addition of 0.038 mt with the negative K\nbalance of 0.985 mt. (Brar 2004) reported that total K loss from Punjab soils\nincreased from 159 thousand tonnes in 1960-61 to 678 thousand tonnes by 200203. This wide gap in potash removal and addition has impoverished soil's potash\nreserves and thus the magnitude and extent of its deficiency and crop responses to\nits application are on increase in both time and space. Sulphur deficiency is\npredominantly seen in the state, limiting the yields of oilseeds, pulses and cereals.\nCurrent status of S balance is negative with mining of about 80 thousand tonnes\nannually in the state (Aulakh and Bahl 2001). Amount of Zn added was several\ntimes higher than its removal and as a result substantial amount of Zn was left in\nthe balance owing to its poor utilization. There is a need to implement the 4 R's\nstrategy of nutrient management focusing right quantity of nutrients through right\nsource at right time by right methods of application, which would help in bridging\nthe nutrientgaps in the state.\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 5 2 2 5\n\n\n\n2 2 5 2\n\n\n\n2 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|State|Nutrients (000 t)|Col3|Col4|Mining<br>Index<br>(R/A)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|State|~~Additions~~<br>(A)|~~Removal~~<br>(R)|~~Balance~~|~~Balance~~|\n|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|\n|N<br>P O<br>K O<br>NPK Total<br>2<br>5<br>2|3180.7<br>1023.6<br>863.1<br>5067.4|1488.3<br>591.8<br>1842.1<br>3922.2|1692.4<br>431.8<br>-979.0<br>1145.2|0.5<br>0.6<br>2.1<br>3.2|\n|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|\n|N<br>P O<br>K O<br>NPK Total<br>2<br>5<br>2|1315.5<br>343.9<br>38.4<br>1697.8|750.2<br>446.3<br>1022.8<br>2219.3|565.2<br>-102.4<br>-984.5<br>-521.6|0.6<br>1.3<br>26.7<br>28.5|\n|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|\n|N<br>P O<br>K O<br>NPK Total<br>2<br>5<br>2|520.6<br>65.1<br>16.6<br>602.3|489.8<br>220.3<br>669.1<br>1379.2|30.8<br>-155.2<br>-652.5<br>-776.9|0.9<br>3.4<br>40.4<br>44.7|\n\n\na*\ufffdInputs\ufffdthrough\ufffdfertilizers,\ufffdirrigation\ufffdwater,\ufffdcrop\ufffdresidues\ufffdand\ufffdFYM\ufffdconsidered\nb*\ufffdInputs\ufffdthrough\ufffdfertilizer\ufffdadditions,\ufffdcontribution\ufffdfrom\ufffdother\ufffdsources\ufffdconsidered\ufffdnegligible\nc* Additions\ufffdthrough\ufffdfertilizers,\ufffd1/3rd\ufffdcontribution\ufffdof\ufffdnutrients\ufffdfrom\ufffdcow\ufffddung\ufffdand\ufffdefficiency\ufffdfactors\nof\ufffd0.55,\ufffd0.25\ufffdand\ufffd0.66\ufffdwere\ufffdconsidered\ufffdfor\ufffdNPK\n\n\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n\nUttar Pradesh is one of the agriculturally important states of Northern India with\n\n\n\n474 475\n\n\n17.6 m ha of gross cropped area, of which 72 percent is irrigated with cropping\nintensity of 152 percent.

In addition to the major nutrients, Sulphur deficiencies\nhave been reported in light textured, low organic matter containing soils, which\nare prone to subsequent leaching and among the micronutrients, zinc is the most\ndeficient micronutrient in the entire state. The results indicate that the farmers of\n\nthe region need to adopt the balanced fertilization strategies in order to keep the\nnutrientbalancesat optimumlevels.\n\n\nKarnataka\n\n\n\nsoils in the state, there is a need to address this issue through appropriate potassium\nnutrientmanagementpractices.\n\n\nKerala\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\nKarnataka state is bestowed with a wide range of soil and climatic conditions that\nsupport myriad species of crops and farming systems. The state has been in the\nfore-front in terms of adoption of newer agricultural practices and maintaining\nfertilizer use (116 kg ha ) at par with the national average of 117 kg ha . The total -1 -1\nnutrient consumption increased from 1.27 mt during 1999-00 to 1.51mt during\n2007-08 and registered an increase of 19 percent in the consumption of total\nnutrients over the last eight years. The state with 6.5 percent of the country's gross\ncropped area has 6.7 percent of total fertilizer nutrients consumed in the country,\nwhich has come down from 1999-2000 levels of 7.6 percent. The consumption of\nN and K\ufffdO at 0.79 and 0.33 mt during 2007-08, registered an increase of 16.2 2\npercent and 52.8 percent, respectively, over 1999-2000, and the consumption of\nP\ufffdO at 0.387 mt recorded a slight increase of 1.3 percent during the period. NPK 2 5\nuse ratio changed from 3.2:1.7:1 to 2.4:1.2:1 during the period.\nThe current nutrient addition through fertilizers was worked out from FAI\n(2008), which reveals that about 1.51 mt of nutrients were consumed against total\nremoval of 1.6 mt of nutrient by different major crops grown in the state resulting\nin a negative nutrient balance of 0.092 mt of NPK that is not met through fertilizer\napplications for the crop year 2007-08 (Table 3). However, considering the\nnutrient availability of about 0.55 mt (Hegde and Surendrababu 2001) through\ndifferent organic sources in the state, the negative balance of 0.92 lakh tonnes of\nnutrients could be considered negligible. However, the negative balance of 0.404\nmt of K is a matter of concern in the state and before depleting the K reserves of the\n\n\n\nThe state of Kerala has net cropped area of only 2.1 m ha and the state produces\nmore than 48 percent of coconut, 97 percent of black pepper and 60 percent of\nnatural rubber in the country. In addition, it has a significant share of India's other\nplantation produces such as coffee, tea, betel nut, cocoa and cashew, fruits such as\nbanana and pineapple and spices like cardamom, ginger, turmeric, nutmeg and\nclove. The fertilizer nutrient consumption in the state decreased marginally by 5\npercent from 0.219 mt during 1998-99 to 0.208 mt during 2007-08 and as a result,\nthe agricultural productivity of the state showed a continuous decline in recent\nyears. While, the consumption of N at 0.093 mt, registered an increase of 7.27\npercent during 2007-08 over 1998-99, the consumption of P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO at 42.7 2 5 2\nand 72.3 thousand ton, recorded a decline of 3.4 percent and 17.2 percent,\nrespectively, during the period. Present NPK use ratio of the state is 1.3:0.5 :1. The\nper hectare consumption of total fertilizer nutrients is 70 kg and is far below the\nnationalaverageof 117 kg ha . -1\nFrom the nutrient balance sheet of Kerala (Table 3), it is quite obvious that the\nfertilizer usage in the state is not adequate to meet the demand for crop removal.\nOut of the potential demand of 0.541 mt of fertilizer nutrients, only 0.21 mt is\nadded through fertilizers during 2007-08 and as a result, there is a net negative\nbalance of 0.332 mt, which is to be supplied through additional nutrient inputs in\norder to overcome excess nutrient mining form the soil. The total K removal by\nmajor crops is reported to be 0.279 mt against total addition of 0.072 mt K through\nfertilizers with a negative potassium balance of 0.206 mt and in consequence the K\nreserve of the soils of the state has depleted. In addition to this, the micronutrient\ndeficiencies are also becoming widespread at an alarming rate (John et al. 2001).\nFor attaining a sustainable crop production from the state and cater to the needs of\nthe ever growing population, there is a need to create awareness among farmers\nabout the responsible management of plant nutrients through balanced and\nintegratednutrientmanagementstrategies.\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n2 5\n\n\n\nTamilNadu\n\n\nTamil Nadu has 3.4 percent of India's gross cropped area with about 4.8 percent of\nthe total fertilizer consumption of the country. The total consumption of fertilizer\nnutrients in the state increased from 0.79 mt during 1998-99 to 1.075 mt during\n2007-08 and has registered an increase of 36 percent over 1998-99 levels. During\nthe last 8-9 years, the consumption of P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO is more than doubled at 0.228 2 5 2\n\n\n\n478 479\n\n\nand 0.304 mt, registered an increase of 56.2 percent and 87.6 percent, respectively.\nThe consumption of N at 0.543 mt, however, increased by only 12.4 percent during\nthis period. Per hectare consumption of total nutrients increased from 152 kg to\n178 kg during the period. The NPK use ratio in the state during 2007-08 is\n2.0:0.7:1.\n\nThe crop nutrient balance of the state generated as per the information given\nin FAI (2008) reveals that the nutrient additions of nitrogen (0.543 mt) is slightly\nhigher than the removal (0.495 mt), resulting in a positive balance of about 0.049\nmt (Table 3). With regard to P nutrition, the removal is slightly higher by 2800\ntonnes over the Paddition through fertilizers and the resulted net negative balance\nis quite manageable in the state. However, the balances pertaining to K nutrition\nwas significantly negative.About 0.73 mt of K was removed as against an addition\nof 0.304 mt and resulted in an alarming negative balance of 0.421 mt. With\nintensive cultivation at a higher stake in the state, this alarming situation would\nresult in depletion of native K reserves of soils and therefore demands attention of\nscientists, extension workers and policy makers for taking up appropriate K\nadditionsthrough mineralfertilizersand other availablesources.\n\n\n**Nutrient balance scenario in majorstates of western India**\n\n\nGujarat\n\n\n\n**Table 4** Nutrient additions, removal by crops and apparent balance in major states of\nWestern India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGujarat having 10.69 million hectares of gross cropped area (31.5 percent\nirrigated) with cropping intensity of 113 percent is one of the agriculturally\nimportant states of Western India.

Major soils of the state\nare alluvial, black, mixed red, red and yellow soils and saline/alkali soils.

The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is 60 percent.\nThe consumption of total fertilizer nutrients in the state increased from 0.99 mt\nduring 1998-99 to 1.3 mt during 2007-08, representing a growth of 31.3 percent,\nduring the last ten years.

Therefore, the N\nbalance in the state seems to be negative (0.119 mt) at present level of crop\nproduction. P was positively balanced at 0.085 mt, however, the K balance was\nextremely negative. The total K removal by major crops at current level of\nproductivity is 0.944 mt against total addition of 0.169 mt through fertilizers and\norganic manures showing a negative balance of 0.775 mt. This wide gap in K\nremoval and addition has impoverished soil's K reserves and thus the magnitude\nand extent of its deficiency and crop responses to its application are on increase in\nboth time and space.The total negative balance of NPK in the state is amounting to\n0.808 mt. Apart from considering nutrient contributions from organic manures,\nthere are considerable quantities of crop residues, forest litters, press mud, poultry\nmanure, biofertilisers etc are also available in the state.

The state is endowed with a\nlarge diversity in soils from dune and associated soils to medium black soils. The\nprincipal crops grown are pearl millet, maize, coarse millets, pulses, oilseeds,\ncotton, vegetables _etc_ . The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is\n59 percent. A variety of cropping systems are in practice in the state. The current\nfertilizer use in the state is only 45.5 kg ha consisting of 32.5, 12.0 and 1.0 kg ha -1 -1\nN, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO respectively, the N: P\ufffdO : K\ufffdO use ratio being 57.4:16.9:1.0. The 2 5 2 2 5 2\nshare of potash to total NPK consumption is only 2.3 percent. The total K removal\nby major crops is reported to be 1.015 mt against total addition of 0.021 mt K\nthrough fertilizers showing negative balance of 0.994 mt and in consequence the K\nreserve of the soils of the state is continuously depleting.\nBased on the nutrients absorbed by the crops and nutrients added through\nfertilizers, the balance sheet shows negative trend for all the three NPK nutrients\n(Table 4). There is a requirement of about 0.12, 0.11 and 0.99 mt of additional NPK\nnutrients to bridge the deficit in the state. Gupta (2001) reported that K mining in\nRajasthan is highest followed by N, S, P and Zn. The negative nutrient balance in\nthe state could be bridged through adequate use of fertilizers. There is a need to\ndouble the present levels of nutrient consumption through additional fertilizer use\nand also by supplying nutrientsthrough cattlemanure and other organic sources.\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nFrom the foregoing discussions, it is conspicuous that the nutrient use pattern in\nmajority of the agriculturally important states of India is inadequate and mostly\ndominated by NPfertilization. The negative balance of K is highly predominant in\nalmost all the states, which imply that the use of K fertilizers is neglected in most\n\n\n\n482 483\n\n\ncases. K additions through the prevailing practices of manuring and residue\nrecycling, as well as the meager inputs through K fertilizers are not sufficient to\nmatch the K removal by different crops and therefore, tremendous efforts are\nneeded to promote K consumption through use of K rich fertilizers. The current\ntrends of nutrient balances reveals that the gap between nutrient use and supply in\nfarming areas will continue to grow wide on account of intensive cropping and\ntherefore, there is a need to ensure proper and timely supply of major as well as\nsecondary and micronutrients. Other than additions through fertilizer nutrients,\npractices like recycling of crop residues instead of taking back the residues away\nfrom the field and use of animal manures through appropriate composting\nprocesses should be encouraged than diverting the resources for fuel and other\nsecondary purposes.\nNutrient balance calculations, sometimes, do not give the real picture as they\nconsider nutrient removal by crops and addition through fertilizers neglecting\ncontribution from sources other than fertilizers such as organic manures, crop\nresidues and stubbles, irrigation water etc. Therefore, contribution of nutrients\nfrom the available sources should be taken into account while making calculations\nto the maximum extent possible. Further, if the average use efficiency of fertilizers\n(N 50-60 percent; P 15-25 percent, K 60-70 percent) is taken into account, the\nnutrient additions through fertilizers is much more reduced and therefore, the\nremoval exceeds the consumption and nutrient gap is widened. Nevertheless, the\nsituation is balanced by addition of the nutrients through biofertilisers, FYM,\ncompost, green manuring or addition of crop residues in the field. The\nconsumption data on secondary and micronutrient fertilizers are not available.\nThere is a need to compute nutrient balances with respect to secondary and\nmicronutrients, giving emphasis primarily to the most limiting nutrients like S, Zn\nand B.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAulakh\ufffdMS,\ufffdBahl\ufffdGS\ufffd(2001)\ufffdNutrient\ufffdmining\ufffdin\ufffdagro-climatic\ufffdzones\ufffdof\ufffdPunjab.\nFert\ufffdNews\ufffd46\ufffd(4):\ufffd47-61\nBrar MS (2004) Potassium mining and agricultural sustainability: Punjab\nScenario Fert News 49 (7): 51-55\nFAI (2008) Fertilizerstatistics.FertiliserAssociation of India, New Delhi\nGuptaAK (2001) Nutrient mining in agro-climatic zones of Rajasthan.
