Long-term fertilizer experiments conducted over 30 years in different agroecological regions involving diversified cropping systems and soil types showed\nsignificant responses of crops to K applications, the effects being more\npronounced in Alfisols and acidic Inceptisols (Aeric Haplaquept). After several\nyears of intensive cropping, response to K application occurred even in alluvial\nsoils dominated by K bearing minerals (illite). Application of K enhanced its\navailable status in soils and uptake by the crops. Contribution of the nonexchangeable K towards total potassium removal was above 90% in the absence\nof applied K which decreased to about 80% with the use of K. Studies on K\nrelease kinetics and Q/I parameters showed that cumulative K release was\nhigher in K treated soils as compared to untreated ones thereby causing a\ngreater decline in non exchangeable K reserves. The results suggest that in\nyears ahead K will be the most limiting factor affecting sustainability of intensive\ncropping systems in India. Therefore, due attention must be paid to K nutrition\nin fertilizer scheduling for different crops/cropping systems.\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nIn most of the intensive cropping systems in India, potassium (K) balance is\nnegative since the additions of K seldom match the K removals resulting in\nlarger dependence on soil K supply. Under such conditions there is greater\npressure on non-exchangeable K for meeting the K requirement of crops.\nLong-term intensive cropping, in the absence of K inputs, adversely affected\nthe K supply to crop plants and consequently crop yields (Swarup, 1998;\nSwarup and Ganeshmurthy, 1998). Potassium deficiencies are now more\n\n\n_**168**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_\n\n\nwidespread even on heavy textured soils such as alluvial illitic soils in India.\nSeveral studies have shown substantial contribution of non-exchangeable K\ntowards K nutrition of crops grown on illite dominant alluvial soils (Srinivasa\nRao _et al.,_ 2001; Swarup and Chhillar, 1986). This is particularly so when\ncropping continues with N + P application without K addition. The K release\nrates from soils under long-term cropping, fertilization and manuring helps\nto predict the fate of added K in soil as well as nature of K supply from soil\nto plant K nutrition. This paper critically reviews the work done on soil\npotassium and its impact on the sustainability of crop production under the\nAll India Coordinated Research Project of ICAR on Long-term Fertilizer\nExperiments.\n\n\n**Crop responses and K uptake vis-\u00e0-vis sustainability issues**\n\n\nIt is generally considered that most of the Indian soils are adequate in K\nsupply. Cereals especially those with deep rooting system often fail to respond\n\nto K in seasonal/short term field trials. The immediate conclusion drawn\n\ncould be that no K is required for such cereals at these locations. However,\nthe situation changes when intensive cropping is followed over the years on\n\nthe same site with N + P fertilizer alone because with consecutive exhaustion\n\nthe true response to K becomes obvious. For example, the crops under longterm experiments on a Mollisol soil at Pantnagar (Nand Ram, 1998) and\nVertisol soil at Jabalpur (Tembhare _et al.,_ 1998) responded to K only after few\nyears of cropping because of its good spatial K exploitation whereas trend in\nyield declines occurred from the beginning in Alfisols at Bangalore, Ranchi\nand Palampur and in an Inceptisol (Aeric Haplaquept) at Bhubaneswar ( **Figs.**\n**1 to 4, Table 1** ). Even in K rich alluvial soil (Typic Ustocrept) at Ludhiana,\nmaize and wheat responded to K application from the very beginning (Brar\nand Pasricha, 1998). A comparison of mean response of K (NPK over NP)\nshowed that yield responses to N and P fertilizer declined in all the soils, the\neffects being more pronounced in Alfisols and more so at Bangalore under\nfinger millet-maize cropping system ( **Table 1** ). On the contrary, a declining\ntrend in response to K fertilizer was observed in maize at Ludhiana and rice\nat Pantnagar after about 10 years of continuous cropping. It was found to be\nassociated with the emergence of Zn deficiency. Thus it can be inferred that\nthe real response to K fertilization can be fully realised only when all the\nlimiting plant nutrients (secondary and micronutrients) are present in optimal\namounts in the soil ( **Table 2** ). The K uptake by crops even at 100% optimal\nNPK dose was far in excess of the fertilizer K applied to the crops on almost\n\n\n_Impact of Long-Term Intensive Cropping on Soil Potassium and Sustainability of Crop Production_ _**169**_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_**Fig. 1.**_ _Effect of different fertilizer treatments on grain yield of Maize and Wheat at Palampur_\n\n\n_**170**_ _J.S.

The uptake data of various crops suggest\nthat fertilizer K recommendations for crops should take into consideration\nnon-exchangeable fraction of soil K.\n\n\nThe change in the cumulative release of K after 20 years of cropping from\nan Inceptisol at Hyderabad ( **Fig. 5** ) indicated the relative contribution of soil\nreserve K (non-exchangeable K) in crop K uptake. While there were fewer\nchanges in the available K form during the period of 20 years, change in nonexchangeable K was more conspicuous. This shows the need to include nonexchangeable K in soil testing methodology, as it was more sensitive to crop\nK removal (Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 2000). Similarly, there was considerable\ndecrease in K release from non-exchangeable fraction of soil K with 20 years\nof cropping ( **Fig. 6** ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_**Fig. 5.

Continuous application of nitrogenous fertilizers alone to soils had a\ndeleterious effect on soil productivity especially in soils deficient in P and\nK; the effects being more pronounced on Alfisols (Palampur, Ranchi and\nBangalore). The available K status in these plots declined to less than\ncritical levels ( **Fig. 7** ). 150% NPK or 100% NPK+FYM maintained higher\navailable pools of K.\n\n\n2. At Ludhiana and Palampur total productivity in the maize-wheat system\nincreased over the years, mainly due to increased productivity of Wheat.\nThis reflects that although the K level in the soil has improved over the\nyears with the application of NPK but yet their optimum levels in the soil\nhave not been attained. This behaviour is confirmed by available K status\nin the soil at both these centres. Similarly, in soybean-wheat system at\nRanchi, the wheat yield has shown increasing trend over the years,\n\n\n_**176**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_\n\n\nobviously, due to improved status of K in the soil in NP treatment over\nN as the soil had deficiency of K to start with.\n\n\n3. There is also evidence at many centres that the crops started drawing on\nthe non-exchangeable source of K when the exchangeable K amount fell\nbelow the critical limits. An excellent example of such a change is provided\nby the experiment at Jabalpur and Bhubneswar centres. The results clearly\nshowed that mining of soil K occurred even with NPK treatment. It is\nindicated that under intensive cropping, the K deficiency will gradually\nincrease unless adequate quantity of K is added from external sources\nsuch as fertilizers and manures. Likewise, the results of experiments on\nfinger millet-rabi maize cropping system at Bangalore clearly indicate\nthat certain treatments with N alone or NP depressed the yields to the\nsame level as the unmanured plot whereas with NPK or NPK + FYM\ntreatments, the yields were stable at higher level. The available K status\n\nof the soil indicated that the soil was not able to meet the K demand of\n\nthe crops. Thus severe K deficiency is limiting the responses to NP.\n\n\n_Impact of Long-Term Intensive Cropping on Soil Potassium and Sustainability of Crop Production_ _**177**_\n\n\n4. The declining trend in yield at many centres indicates the need for critical\nexamination and modification of the existing K fertilizer recommendation\nto compensate for gradual loss of native soil K fertility. Results at\nBhubaneswar centre ( **Table 3** ) with superimposed treatments showed that\nenhanced dose of K in excess of 100% NPK is extremely important for\nimproving rice-rice productivity and maintaining available K in the soils.\n\n\n**Table 3: Effect of superimposition of treatments on grain yield of rice at Bhubaneswar**\n\n|Superimposed treatment|Grain yield (t ha-1)|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|_Superimposed treatment_|_1994-95_|_1994-95_|_1995-96_|_1995-96_|_1996-97_|_1996-97_|\n|_Superimposed treatment_|_Kharif_|_Rabi_|_Kharif_|_Rabi_|_Kharif_|_Rabi_|\n|**Treatment 8 of Replication III**<br>ST1-100% NPK + FYM|3.28|3.20|2.50|2.98|3.14|2.96|\n|ST2-100% N + 50% P + 100% K + FYM|3.28|3.14|2.48|3.09|3.14|2.94|\n|ST3-100% N + 50% P + 150% K + FYM|3.39|3.17|2.71|3.20|3.30|3.12|\n\n\n\n**Non-exchangeable K release rates in different soil types under intensive**\n**cropping**\n\n\nSome workers have shown that intensive cropping for a long period would\nreduce the exchangeable K to a minimum level and at this level the release\nof non-exchangeable potassium starts (Sachdeva and Khera, 1980). Krishna\nKumari _et al._ (1984) investigated the potassium release behaviour of an\ninceptisol (Holambi series) at the minimum level of exchangeable potassium\nand found that there was no response to potassium fertilizer applications,\neven when the soil was intensively fertilized with N and P without addition\nof potassium for ten years. Consecutively no K deficiency symptoms were\nexhibited by maize and wheat crops. On the basis of six successive cropping\nwith pearlmillet, Mehta (1976) found that non-exchangeable K contributed\n81% of the total K removed by plants in the alluvial soils of Gujarat. The\nreason proposed for the rapid release of non-exchangeable K under intensive\ncropping is that a concentration gradient is set up from high concentration of\nK in unexpanded towards the K depleted expanded part of the clay (Thomas,\n1967).\n\n\nUse of organic acids to extract non-exchangeable K from soil is believed\nto match the root extraction to soil K during intensive cropping. The\ncumulative K release was higher in Vertisols followed by Inceptisols and\n\n\n_**178**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_\n\n\nAlfisols. Smectitic soil released about 25% whereas illitic soil released about\n\n13% of non-exchangeable K to in malic acid.\n\n\nEven though illite or mica is the primary source of non-exchangeable K in\nInceptisols as well as Vertisols, the relative mobility of K from the illite minerals\nof Inceptisols is less compared to that of Vertisols. This is also observed from\nlower release rate constants of Inceptisols (3.5 h [\u20131] ), compared to Alfisols (3.52\nh [\u20131] ) and Vertisols (4.03 h [\u20131] ). Differences in the composition of illite such as\nbiotite or muscovite could make a very substantial difference in K release\nbetween Vertisols and Inceptisols (Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 2001).\n\n\n**Changes in non-exchangeable K and its contribution to plant K uptake**\n\n\nChange in Non-exchangeable K of soils under intensive cropping has been\nobserved in many cases irrespective of the available K status and dominant\nminerals of soils. Effect of long-term rice-rice cropping, fertilisation and\nmanuring on K release pattern in 0.01 M CaCl 2 and by electro-ultra filtration\n(EUF) fraction (Srinivas Rao _et al.,_ 2000) indicated a substantial reduction in\nK release from soils due to continuous cropping. Application of 100% NPK\n+ 15 t FYM maintained higher K release whereas 100% NP showed the lowest\nK release. Non-exchangeable K released during 30-35 minutes in EUF\nextraction also indicated a similar change. It can be observed from the pattern\nof EUF desorption that K desorbed during the first 30 minutes (which indicates\nexchangeable from of K) did not vary much among treatments whereas the\ndifferences were much clear in EUF 30-35 K (Non-exchangeable K). Nonexchangeable release rate constants of Inceptisol as influenced by 14 years of\nrice-rice cropping, fertilization and manuring ( **Table 4** ) also indicated\nconsiderable decrease in non-exchangeable K release due to cropping\n\n\n**Table 4:** **Non-exchangeable K release rate constants in 0.01 M citric acid (zero order X 10** **[2]** **)**\n**of Incptisols as influenced by 14 years rice-rice cropping, fertilization and**\n\n\n|manuring|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|_Treatment_|_1980_|_1980_|_1994_|_1994_|\n|_Treatment_|_0-73 h_|_0-217 h_|_0-73 h_|_0-217 h_|\n|Control<br>100% N<br>100% NP<br>100% NPK<br>100% NPK+FYM|53<br>40<br>36<br>63<br>75|29<br>26<br>23<br>32<br>37|33<br>33<br>29<br>52<br>53|22<br>20<br>16<br>25<br>28|\n\n_Impact of Long-Term Intensive Cropping on Soil Potassium and Sustainability of Crop Production_ _**179**_\n\n\n(Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 1999). The differences were more clear during initial 73\nhours of extraction as compared to release rates for the entire period of\n\nincubation.\n\n\nTen cycles of maize-wheat cropping at Ludhiana substantially reduced the\nnon-exchangeable K especially under higher level of N and P application\nwhereas application of 100 kg K ha [\u20131] decreased the extent of change in nonexchangeable K ( **Fig. 8** ) at Ludhiana (Brar and Pasricha, 1998). Contribution\nof non-exchangeable K towards K uptake by crops as a result of K application\ndecreased from 97% to 81% in a Vertisol at Jabalpur whereas it decreased\nfrom 100% to 27% in an Aeric Haplaquept at Bhubaneswar ( **Table 5** ). Reduction\nin non-exchangeable K under long-term cropping of finger millet-maizecowpea sequence was observed in a Vertic Inceptisol at Coimbatore and under\nsoybean-wheat-cowpea system at Jabalpur. In both the cases reductions were\nof larger magnitude in the absence of K supply (NP treatment) as compared\nto 100% NPK + FYM treatment. Similar observations were made by Subba\nRao _et al._ (1993) in another long-term fertilizer experiment on alluvial soils\nwith sorghum-wheat cropping at PRII, Gurgoan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Table 5:** **Removal and addition of potassium during 27 crop cycles of soybean-wheat-maize fodder * and 21 crop cycles of rice-**\n\n|rice rotations|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Treatment<br>|Fertilizer K<br>added during<br>27 and 21<br>crop<br>rotations<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2|Fertilizer K<br>added during<br>27 and 21<br>crop<br>rotations<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2|Available K (Kg ha\u20131)<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>Cropping<br>Cropping Cropping<br>Cropping<br><br>Before<br>After<br>Before<br>After<br>(1971)<br>(1999)<br>(1971)<br>(1994)|Available K (Kg ha\u20131)<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>Cropping<br>Cropping Cropping<br>Cropping<br><br>Before<br>After<br>Before<br>After<br>(1971)<br>(1999)<br>(1971)<br>(1994)|Available K (Kg ha\u20131)<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>Cropping<br>Cropping Cropping<br>Cropping<br><br>Before<br>After<br>Before<br>After<br>(1971)<br>(1999)<br>(1971)<br>(1994)|Available K (Kg ha\u20131)<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>Cropping<br>Cropping Cropping<br>Cropping<br><br>Before<br>After<br>Before<br>After<br>(1971)<br>(1999)<br>(1971)<br>(1994)|Total K<br>uptake<br>(kg ha\u20131)<br>(kg ha\u20131)<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2|Total K<br>uptake<br>(kg ha\u20131)<br>(kg ha\u20131)<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>1<br>2|Contribution<br>of non-<br>exch.

Several studies have\ninvestigated the influence of K fertilization strategies on (Q/I) parameters in\nsoil. These studies, however, did not evaluate the long-term effects of cropping,\nK fertilization and manuring on the Q/I relation in soils. Long-term\nexperiments are an important means for obtaining information on the longterm sustainability of agricultural systems. A knowledge of Q/I relationship\nof potassium in soil together with their distribution in the zone of root\npenetration helps to predict the fate of added K in soil profile as well as\nnature of K supply from subsoil layers to plant K nutrition particularly in\ndeep rooted crops and in formulating sound fertilizer recommendations.\n\n\nLong-term cropping, fertilization, and manuring in a Typic Ustocrept at\nDelhi influenced the K supplying power of the top soil and subsoil layers,\nthe effects being more pronounced on top soil. The highest and lowest values\nof equilibrium activity ratio (AR ek ), labile pool of K (K L ), non-specific or\nimmediately available K ( K 0 ) and specific or difficulty available K (K X )\nwere observed in 100% NPK+FYM and 100% NP plots, respectively at all\ndepths. Despite low AR ek, K L and free energies of exchange for the replacement\nof calcium with potassium ( G) values in control, N and NP plots, maize,\nwheat and cowpea did not show any deficiency symptoms thereby indicating\nthat sufficient K is being released from non-exchangeable K source (Rupa _et_\n_al._, 2001).\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nThe long-term fertiliser experiments being carried out in different\nagroecological regions of India involving diversified intensive cropping\nsystems and soil types have established increasing crop responses to K\napplication, the effects being more pronounced in Alfisols and Inceptisols as\ncompared to Vertisols and Mollisols. Continuous monitoring of available and\nnon-exchangeable K status is extremely important for making sound K\nfertilizer recommendations for sustaining crop productivity in different soil\n\ntypes.\n\n\n_**182**_ _J.S.
