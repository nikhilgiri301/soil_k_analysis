This study was carried out to study the release\nof non-exchangeable K from 22 surface and subsurface soils of southern Iran using successive extraction with\n10 mmol/l of CaCl 2 and oxalic acid in a period of 2\u22121368 h at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Alfisols, Aridisols, Entisols, Inceptisols,\nMollisols, and Histosols were among the studied soil orders. Illite, smectite, chlorite, vermiculite, kaolinite and\npalygorskite clay minerals were identified. The amount of non-exchangeable K varied from 95 to 506 mg/kg. Re\u00ad\nsults showed that CaCl 2 and oxalic acid released 60 and 55% of non-exchangeable K from soils, respectively. The\ndiscontinuity in slope was found when the cumulative amount of released K was plotted versus time, supporting\nthe multi-reactive nature of K exchange sites. The cumulative K release in soils ranged from 87 to 300 mg/kg for\nCaCl 2 and 78 to 300 mg/kg for oxalic acid which was well described by simplified Elovich and power function\nequations. The _b_ constant of simplified Elovich as an index of non-exchangeable K release rate was in the range of\n10 to 36 mg/kg for CaCl 2 and 11 to 36 mg/kg for oxalic acid. The highest _b_ constant was measured in Inceptisols\nand Alfisols, while the lowest values were found in Entisols and Histosols. In conclusion, the K release pattern was\nsimilar for both extractants and affected by clay content and type, and soil depth.\n\n\n**Keywords** : calcium chloride; clay mineralogy; kinetic equations; organic acid\n\n\n\nPotassium, as the seventh most frequent element\nof the Earth crust (2.6% of weight), is an essential\nnutrient for humans, animals, and plants. Soil potas\u00ad\nsium could be divided into soluble, exchangeable,\nnon-exchangeable, and structural forms. The major\nproportion of soil potassium is structural (90\u201398%),\nwhereas soluble and exchangeable (0.1\u20132%) and nonexchangeable potassium (2\u201310%) constitute only\na small portion of total soil K. Non-exchangeable\nK is released to exchangeable forms to meet plant\nneeds of potassium (Sparks & Huang 1985). Mar\u00ad\ntin and Sparks (1983) suggested that the release\nof K from non-exchangeable to exchangeable form\ncould be limited when the concentration of K in the\n\nsoil solution exceeds 1 mmol/l. Wang _et al_ . (2011)\n\n\n**200**\n\n\n\nshowed that the critical level of soluble K for the\n\nrelease of non-exchangeable K could be related to\nthe type of clay minerals and content of Ca [2+] and\nNa [+] in the soil solution. Jalali (2006) stated that\nthe calcareous soils of Iran containing sufficient\nexchangeable K and K-bearing minerals are capable\nof releasing sufficient K for optimal plant produc\u00ad\ntion. However, exchangeable K is not always a reli\u00ad\nable estimation of plant availability of potassium in\ncalcareous soils. The interaction of soil mineralogy,\ntextural characteristics, and biological processes\nmay influence the release of potassium in different\nsoil orders (Simonsson _et al_ . 2007). Therefore, the\nresearch on the rate of non-exchangeable K release\nseems necessary in such soils.\n\n\n_Soil & Water Res., 13, 2018 (4): 200\u2013207_ _Original Paper_\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.17221/138/2017-SWR\n\n\n\nSeveral equations including zero order, first order,\nElovich, parabolic diffusion, and power function have\nbeen used to describe the kinetics of non-exchange\u00ad\nable K release and to evaluate soil K availability for\nplant growth (Srinivasarao _et al_ . 2006; Wang _et_\n_al_ . 2011). Jalali and Khanlari (2014) described the\n\nK release from some calcareous soils of western Iran\n\nusing Elovich, parabolic diffusion and power function\nequations. Hosseinpur and Motaghian (2013)\nstudied the release of non-exchangeable K from 10 cal\u00ad\ncareous soils of central Iran using 10 mmol/l CaCl 2 .\nThey reported that the release of non-exchangeable\nK was well described by parabolic diffusion, power\nfunction and simplified Elovich. The _b_ constant of\nkinetic equations clearly showed the release rate of\nnon-exchangeable K and its availability.\n\nMany crops, especially deep-rooted crops, can\nobtain a substantial amount of K from lower layers\nof soils, but the release of non-exchangeable K in\nsubsoil samples has been investigated to a lesser\nextent. We hypothesized that soil physicochemical\nproperties and clay mineralogy are quite different\nin various soil orders and soil depths, which in turn\naffect the release of non-exchangeable K related to\nsoil classification. Data about non-exchangeable K\ncontent and its release related to clay minerals and\nsoil development are highly valuable for fertility man\u00ad\nagement of soils. However, limited data are available\nfor soils of southern Iran. The aims of the present\nresearch were to study: (1) the non-exchangeable K\nrelease rate in 22 surface and subsurface soils with\n\ndifferent clay mineralogy and soil properties using\nCaCl 2 and oxalic acid extractants, and (2) the rela\u00ad\n\n\n\ntionship between K release rate and selected phys\u00ad\nicochemical properties and clay mineralogy of soils.\n\n\n**MATERIAL AND METHODS**\n\n\n**Study area and sampling of soils** . The study area\nis located in Fars Province, southern Iran (Figure 1).\nThe mean annual temperature and precipitation were\n17\u00b0C and 339 mm, respectively. The area was clas\u00ad\nsified as semi-arid region with xeric moisture and\nthermic temperature regimes. Forty pedons were\nstudied and eleven representative pedons (Figure 1)\nwere selected for physicochemical, morphological,\nand clay mineralogical studies.\n\n**Physicochemical properties** . Particle size distri\u00ad\nbution was identified using a hydrometer (Gee &\nBauder 1986). Calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE)\nwas determined by the acid dissolution (Loeppert\n& Suarez 1996). The method of Nelson and Som\u00ad\nmers (1982) was used for organic matter measure\u00ad\nment. Cation exchange capacity was investigated by\n1 mol/l NaOAc, pH 8.2 (Chapman 1965) and HNO 3\nextractable K (as total K) was determined with boiling\nnitric acid 1 mol/l (Pratt 1965) and extractable K\nwas determined with NH 4 OAc (Mc Lean & Watson\n1985). Non-exchangeable K content was calculated\nwith the following formula:\n\n\nNon _-_ exchangeable K = HNO 3 extractable K \u2013\n\nNH OAc extractable K\n4\n\n\n**Clay mineralogy** . Clay mineralogy was performed\non the first and second horizon (total of 22 samples)\nof each pedon (Kittrick & Hope 1963; Jackson\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Location of the study area in Fars Province in southern Iran and location of eleven pedons studied in Ghare\u00ad\nbagh Plain\n\n\n**201**\n\n\n_Original Paper_ _Soil & Water Res., 13, 2018 (4): 200\u2013207_\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.17221/138/2017-SWR\n\n\n\n1975). A 1130 X-ray diffractometer (Philips, Netherlands) with Cu K\u03b1 target under 40 kV and 30 mA was\nused for the analysis. Semi-quantitative estimation\nof clay minerals was performed by comparing the\narea under each diffractogram in Mg-saturated slide\ntreated with ethylene glycol (Johns _et al_ . 1954).\n\n**K-release kinetics** . Soluble and exchangeable K\nwas first removed from soil samples using 1 mol/l\nCaCl 2 for 24 h followed by the centrifugation of\nsuspensions. Excess Cl was removed by water and\nalcohol (Martin & Sparks 1983). Subsequently,\n2 g soil samples in 3 replicates were transferred\ninto centrifuge tubes in two sets containing 20 ml of\n10 mmol/l of CaCl 2 and oxalic acid solutions. Samples\nwere equilibrated for 2, 4, 8, 14, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96,\n120, 168, 192, 360, 528, 696, 864, 1200, and 1368 h\nat 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. After each period, the supernatant was\nseparated and a new portion of extractant was added,\nshaken, and centrifuged. The K concentration was\nmeasured in the supernatant by a flame photometer\n(Model PFP7, Jenway, UK). The cumulative release\nof non-exchangeable K with time was fitted to the\nsimplified Elovich equation:\n\n\n_Y_ = _a_ + _b_ ln _t_\n\n\nparabolic diffusion equation:\n\n\n_Y_ = _a_ + _b_ _t_ [1/2]\n\n\nand power function equation:\n\n\nln _Y_ = ln _a_ + _b_ ln _t_\n\n\nwhere:\n\n_Y_ \u2013 quantity of K released (mg/kg) at time _t_\n_a_, _b_ \u2013 constants\n\n\nThe above equations were tested using the _R_ [2] analy\u00ad\nsis and standard error of the estimate by\n\n\nSE = [\u2211 ( _Y_ \u2013 _Y_ *) [2] /( _n_ \u2013 2)] [1/2]\n\n\nwhere:\n\n_Y_ - \u2013 calculated content of K released at time _t_\n\n_n_ \u2013 data number\n\n\n**Statistical analyses** . Statistical analyses were per\u00ad\nformed using SPSS software package (Ver. 23, 2016).\nThe means were compared using Duncan\u2019s test at\n_P_ < 0.05. Linear regression procedure was used to\ndescribe the kinetic equations of non-exchangeable\nK release. The correlation between K release char\u00ad\n\nacteristics and selected soil chemical and physical\nproperties was calculated using Pearson\u2019s test.\n\n\n**202**\n\n\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n\nSoils of Gharebagh Plain were classified as Enti\u00ad\nsols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Histosols, Aridisols, and\nAlfisols (Table 1).\n\nResults of the study showed that the pH of soils\nranged from 7.1 to 8.3, EC ranged from 0.8 to 32 mS/cm\nand the CaCO 3 content ranged from 32 to 8%. The\nminimum (0.1%) and the maximum (21%) contents\nof organic carbon were measured in Aridisols and\nHistosols, respectively. The CEC ranged from 72 in\nEntisols to 578 mmol(+)/kg in Histosols (Table 2).\n\nThe semi-quantitative clay mineralogy in the area\nis shown in Table 1. The trend of palygorskite < kao\u00ad\nlinite < vermiculite < chlorite < smectite < illite was\n\nobserved for clay mineral content. Palygorskite was\nfound only in saline soils, but other clay minerals\nwere detected in all studied soils. The relative quanti\u00ad\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The overall results\nshowed that the studied soils contained large amounts\nof non-exchangeable K except Histosols (pedon 5)\nand subsoil layer of Entisols (pedon 1). The maximum\ncontent of non-exchangeable K (506 mg/kg soil) was\nfound in the surface layer of Inceptisols having ver\u00ad\ntic properties (pedon 2) with a high amount of clay\n(41%) and relatively low calcium carbonate (37%),\nwhereas the minimum content (95 mg/kg soil) was\n\n\n\nmeasured in the subsoil of Entisols (pedon 1) with\nlow clay (10%) and high calcium carbonate contents\n(88%) (Table 3). The release of non-exchangeable K\nby both the extractants was higher in surface soil\ncompared to subsurface soil (Table 4). CaCl 2 and\noxalic acid released more K in surface soils compared\nto subsurface soils (22 and 28%, respectively) from\nnon-exchangeable positions (Table 4).\n\nTime-dependent cumulative K released from soils\nusing CaCl 2 and oxalic acid is plotted in Figure 2.\nThe trend of the cumulative K release pattern was\nnon-linear and almost similar by the two extractants.\nThe K release pattern was characterized by an initial\n\n\n\n(a) Oxalic acid CaCl 2\n\n\n\np2 p4 p5 p6 p8\n\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\n\np2 p4 p5 p6 p8\n\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\n\n\np2 p4 p8 p6 p5\n\n\np2 p4 p6 p8 p5\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n300\n\n\n200\n\n\n100\n\n\n300\n\n\n250\n\n\n200\n\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n300\n\n\n200\n\n\n100\n\n\n0\n\n\n250\n\n\n200\n\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n\n50\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nTime (h) Time (h)\n\n\nFigure 2.

Plant\nuptake and leaching have been known to deplete\nsoluble and exchangeable K. In such conditions,\nnon-exchangeable K, which is less available to plants,\ncould gradually be released to readily available (solu\u00ad\nble and exchangeable K) forms (Najafi-Ghiri _et_\n_al_ . 2010). The maximum K release was observed in\nthe surface horizon of Inceptisols (Table 3), due to\nthe presence of vertic properties (pedon 2) caused\nby illite and higher content of non-exchangeable K\n(Tables 1 and 3). On the other hand, the minimum\n\nK release was measured in the subsurface horizon\n\nof an Entisol with low clay and high calcium car\u00ad\n\n\n\nbonate contents. Supporting this conclusion, the\npositive correlation was found between clay content\n( _r_ = 0.67** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = 0.64** for oxalic acid)\nand K release. In contrast, the non-exchangeable\nK release was negatively correlated with CaCO 3 con\u00ad\ntent ( _r_ =\u20130.81** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = \u20130.78** for oxalic\nacid), probably due to its dilution effect. The effects\nof clay type, clay content and non-exchangeable K\ncontent on K release were also reported by other\nresearchers (Ajiboye & Ogunwale 2008; NajafiGhiri _et al_ . 2012).\n\nThe contents of non-exchangeable K and cumula\u00ad\ntive release of non-exchangeable K in surface soils\nwere significantly higher than in subsurface soils,\nwhich could be due to the higher content of illite\nand lower CaCO content in surface soil. The illite\n3\ncontent of surface soil was higher than in subsurface\nsoil (Table 4). The higher illite content on the surface\ncould be attributed to addition of K fertilizers and\n\ntransformation of smectite to illite together with\nhigh weathering of primary mica minerals to illite\n(Srinivasarao _et al_ . 2006; Simonsson _et al_ . 2009).\n\n\n\nTable 5.

The two\nphases of K release from soils were also reported by\nSrinivasarao _et al_ . (2006). Hosseinpur _et al_ . (2012)\nstated that the initial fast release of K may be due to\nthe release of K from peripheral edge sites whereas\nthe subsequent slower reaction represented the K re\u00ad\nlease from interlayer sites. Potassium ions could be\nreplaced from edge and planar sites of clay minerals\nby Ca [2+] but, due to high ionic radius and hydration\nenergy, Ca [2+] is not capable of replacing interlayer K.\nThe interlayer K could gradually be released with\ntime. Exudation of organic acids from roots into soil\nmay increase K availability. Oxalic acid is a com\u00ad\nmon organic acid identified in the rhizosphere of\ncalcicole plants (Rengel & Damon 2008). The acid\ncan destroy the soil K minerals such as muscovite,\nbiotite, and k-feldspars resulting in the release of K\nfrom non-exchangeable forms. However, the release\nof K by oxalic acid was lower than that by CaCl 2 . The\nlower released K content by oxalic acid might be due\nto high pH and CaCO 3 content of the studied soils\n(Table 3). The soils used in the present study were\ncalcareous, containing more than 30% of CaCO 3 and\npH > 7.2. Oxalic acid has two H [+] which are dissoci\u00ad\nated at pH > 4.5. Thus, the two free negative charges\ncould complexate with cations such as K, Ca, and Na.\nUnlike malate and citrate, oxalate has a great ability to\nchelate with Ca and oxalic acid is largely precipitated\nas Ca-oxalate and thereby a low content of K may be\nreleased (Tu _et al_ . 2007; Wani 2012).\n\nThe _b_ constant of the power function equation\nwas measured less than 1 in studied soils showing\na decrease in the K release with time (Table 5). It is\n\nwell documented that the _b_ constant from the Elovich\n\nequation can be used as an index of K release rate\n(Hosseinpur & Motaghian 2013). The positive cor\u00ad\nrelation was found between cumulative K released by\nCaCl 2 ( _r_ = 0.97**) and oxalic acid ( _r_ = 0.98**) with clay\ncontent. Also, _b_ from Elovich was positively correlated\nwith cumulative K release by CaCl 2 ( _r_ = 0.61**) and\noxalic acid ( _r_ = 0.65**). In contrast, the _b_ parameter\nconstant from Elovich was negatively correlated with\nCaCO 3 content ( _r_ = \u20130.77** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = \u20130.72**\nfor oxalic acid). Hosseinpur _et al_ . (2012) stated that\ndifferent _b_ constants could clearly reflect different\nK release power of their studied soils.\n\n\n**206**\n\n\n\nComparison of the _b_ constant between oxalic acid\nand CaCl showed a similar effect of the extractants\n2\non releasing K from non-exchangeable positions\n(Table 5). The clay mineral composition of studied\nsoils was almost similar, but illite seems to control\n\nthe K release rate of the soils. Our results indicated\n\nthat the _b_ constant was high in surface layers of In\u00ad\nceptisols and Alfisols with high clay and illite contents\n(pedons 2 and 8), whereas the lowest _b_ constant was\nfound in the subsurface horizons of Entisols (pedon 1)\nand Histosols (pedon 5). The high _b_ constant in\npedons 2 and 8 might be attributed to the expand\u00ad\nable nature of illite which permits K to be released\nfrom the edges and wedge areas (Srinivasarao _et_\n_al_ . 2006). The high content of non-exchangeable K\nin pedons 2 and 8 may also be responsible for the\nhigh _b_ constant in these soils (Table 3).\n\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\n\nThis study highlighted the relationship between\nnon-exchangeable K release and soil classification,\nclay mineralogy and soil depth in semi-arid regions\nof Fars Province **.** The results showed that soil order,\nsoil depth, and clay type play a significant role in\nnon-exchangeable K content and K release rate. The\nlowest contents of non-exchangeable K and K release\nrate were found in subsurface layers of Entisols with\nhigh CaCO 3 and low clay contents (pedon 1); while,\nthe highest values were found in Inceptisols with low\nCaCO 3 and high clay contents, dominated by illite.\nResults also indicated that the studied soils con\u00ad\n\ntained large amounts of non-exchangeable K which\ncould be released to accessible forms. However, the\namount of this reservoir has been depleted due to\ndevelopment of irrigated production systems, thus\nfurther application of K fertilizer seems necessary\nin the early future.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAjiboye G.A., Ogunwale J.A.
