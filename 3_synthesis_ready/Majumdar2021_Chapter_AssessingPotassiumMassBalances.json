Majumdar et al.\n\n\nAbstract Estimating nutrient mass balances using information on nutrient additions\nand removals generates useful, practical information on the nutrient status of a soil or\n\n\u2013\narea. A negative input output balance of nutrients in the soil results when the crop\nnutrient removal and nutrient losses to other sinks become higher than the nutrient\n\n\u2013\ninputs into the system. Potassium (K) input output balance varies among regions\nthat have different climates, soil types, cropping systems, and cropping intensity.\nThis chapter illustrates the farm-gate K balances in major production areas of the\nworld and their impacts on native K fertility and crop yields. On-farm and on-station\nresearch examples show significant negative K balances in South Asia and\nSub-Saharan Africa, while China, the USA, Brazil, and countries of the Latin\nAmerica Southern Cone highlighted continued requirement of location-specific K\napplication to maintain crop yields and soil K fertility status at optimum levels.\n\n\n11.1 Concepts of Soil Nutrient Balance\n\n\nSoil nutrient balance is an account of the total inputs and outputs of a particular\nnutrient in an agroecosystem (NAL 2020). Soil nutrient balance is the principle of\nmass balance applied to crop nutrients. Mass balance accounts for the matter\nentering, present in, and leaving a system. \u00d6born et al. (2003) separated soil nutrient\nbalances into three categories: farm-gate, field, and farm-system budgets. These\ntypes of balances compare nutrient imports to nutrient exports. Farm-gate balances\nare not limited to farms but can be calculated at a variety of scales, depending on the\ndata available. In this chapter, we focus on K farm-gate balances at the state/province\nand national levels across major production areas of the world.\n\n\n11.1.1 Potassium Removal and Use for Different Cropping\nSystems and Geopolitical Boundaries\n\n\nBecause of its economic and environmental importance, there is increasing interest\nin developing ways to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of fertilizer use on\nfarms, as well as at regional and national scales. Partial nutrient balance (PNB) is,\nfor a given nutrient, the sum of outputs divided by the sum of inputs (Table 11.1).\nPartial factor productivity (PFP) is, for a given nutrient, biomass yield divided by\nthe sum of inputs. Both can provide some guidance on system-level efficiency\nrelative to nutrient use. These two metrics have been used to describe system\nperformance in relation to nutrient use at continental (Ladha et al. 2003), national\n(Lassaletta et al. 2014), regional (Edis et al. 2012), and at farm-gate (Gourley et al.\n2012) scales, and by industry (McLaughlin et al. 1992). Although trends in N and P\nuse have been presented (Zhang et al. 2015; Lassaletta et al. 2014), there are few\nreports of these trends for K other than Fixen et al. (2015). This chapter seeks to\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 285\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Table 11.1 Commonly used K use efficiency metrics and t|typical ranges fo|or cereal crops|\n|---|---|---|\n|Potassium use ef\ufb01ciency abbreviation, calculations<br>(calc), and unitsa|Equationb|Typical ranges for<br>cerealsc|\n|PFPK: partial factor productivity<br>calc: biomass yield/sum of K inputs<br>units: kg biomass (kg K)\u20131|Y/IK|75\u2013200|\n|PNBK: partial nutrient balance<br>calc: sum of K outputs/sum of K inputs<br>units: unitless|OK/IK|0.7\u20130.9|\n|PNBIK: partial nutrient balance intensity<br>calc: sum of K inputs \u2013 sum of K outputs<br>units: kg K ha\u20131 or kg K2O ha\u20131|IK\u2013OK|\u2013|\n|AEK: agronomic ef\ufb01ciency<br>calc: increase in biomass yield/sum of K inputs<br>units: kg biomass (kg K input)\u20131|(Y+K \u2013 Y\u2013K)/<br>IK|8\u201320|\n|REK: recovery ef\ufb01ciency<br>calc: increase in K uptake/sum of K inputs<br>units: unitless|(U+K \u2013 U\u2013<br>K)/IK|0.3\u20130.5|\n\n\na Generalized from Dobermann (2007) to apply to all inputs and outputs in the K cycle\nb Y, biomass yield; I K, sum of K inputs; O K, sum of K outputs; Y +K, biomass yield where K was\nadded; Y \u2013K, biomass yield where K was not added; U +K, plant K uptake where K was added; U \u2013K,\nplant K uptake where K was not added\nc Fixen et al. (2015)\n\n\nprovide a selection of case studies from different regions and at different scales on\nthe removal and use of K within farming systems.\n\n\n11.1.2 Metrics for Nutrient Use Efficiency\n\n\nNutrient use efficiency (NUE) is an evaluation of crop performance based on the\nquantity of a given nutrient input. Nutrient use efficiency is a broad term and is\nquantified in various ways by various metrics. Table 11.1 shows a selection of\nnutrient use efficiency terms and their definitions. Partial nutrient balance and PFP\nhave already been discussed. Partial nutrient balance intensity (PNBI) is, for a\ngiven nutrient, the sum of inputs minus the sum of outputs on an area basis. Where\ndata or estimates exist, outputs and inputs can include all of those in the K cycle\n[(Fig. 1.2, Chap. 1). Agronomic efficiency (AE) is, for a given nutrient, the increase](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_1)\nin biomass yield divided by the associated sum of inputs. Positive returns to fertilizer\ninvestments are indicated when AE is greater than the ratio of fertilizer price to crop\nprice. Recovery efficiency (RE) is, for a given nutrient, the increase in uptake\ndivided by the associated sum of inputs. Recovery efficiency ranges from 0 to 1, with\n1 interpreted as complete uptake of all of the nutrients applied. Of these metrics,\nPNB and PNBI are most often used to evaluate soil nutrient balances.\nAt the field, farm, or region scale, PNB K and PNBI K are often calculated using\nonly harvested plant K and fertilizer K (inorganic and organic). Calculating PNB K\n\n\n286 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nand PNBI K with just these data is widely performed, but only indicates the fate of\nharvest nutrients and does not consider other transfer or retention fates. Partial\n\nnutrient balance has been recommended by the International Fertilizer Association\n(IFA 2020), the EU Nitrogen Expert Panel (2015), and the Global Partnership on\nNutrient Management (Norton et al. 2015) as the most appropriate measure of\nnutrient use efficiency because data are generally available at farm and national\nlevels from which it can be calculated.\n\nIn the context of K, when the sum of K outputs equals the sum of K inputs,\nPNB K \u00bc 1 and PNBI K \u00bc 0. When more K is added than removed, PNB K < 1 and\nPNBI K - 0 (positive). The nutrient not removed can either be stored in the soil\nand/or flow through to the environment. When more K is removed than supplied,\nPNB K - 1 and PNBI K < 0 (negative), indicating that the soil is being depleted of K,\nlowering soil fertility. The extent to which this depletion can continue without\naffecting yield depends on the level of soil reserves as well as the rate at which K\nbecomes plant available.\nPartial nutrient balance does not describe pathways of internal K transformation\nwithin a system (e.g., K dissolution or fixation in soils). It is not necessarily a direct\nquantitative estimate of K loss from the system, because K not removed in the\nharvest might remain on site in the soil. Over the long term, however, changes in soil\nK stocks are usually small relative to inputs and outputs, and therefore, low PNB K\nvalues over multiple years are reasonably reliable indirect indicators of K depletion.\nThe selection of NUE indicators should be considered in the light of the purpose\nof the undertaking. An indicator may be used by growers at field scale or as a\n\n\u2014\nstatement of accountability at a regional and/or industry scale. The two reasons\n\n\u2014\nwhile not mutually exclusive do require clarity of purpose and transparency of data\nused to derive them. None of the indicators reference soil health or soil nutrient\n\nconcentrations, so they are incomplete in their description of sustainability impacts.\nBecause marginal nutrient use declines as the nutrient is supplied, the highest values\nof many indicators occur at the lowest level of application which is also likely the\nlowest yield. More discussion on selecting appropriate nutrient performance indicators can be found in Fixen et al. (2015) and Norton et al. (2015).\n\n\n11.1.3 Uncertainties in Estimating Nutrient Balances\n\n\nNutrient balances provide perspective on the extent of nutrient sources relative to\ncrop demand and may be helpful in identifying opportunities to improve nutrient use\nefficiency. However, unlike a financial balance sheet, nutrient balances involve\nconsiderable uncertainty, particularly at regional and national scales. These uncertainties derive from regional variations in crop K concentration, inadequate information on nutrient removal by some crops, lack of information on the contribution of\nmanure, inability to account for nutrient loss by runoff and erosion, poor fertilizer\nuse data, and other factors. Because of these sources of error, at best, nutrient balance\nis only a partial balance (Roberts and Majumdar 2017).\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 287\n\n\nDeriving these ratios relies on reliable data on crop production (e.g., FAOSTAT),\nfertilizer use (e.g., IFA industry statistics), and crop product nutrient density (e.g.,\nFAOSTAT). While of interest at a general level, the data do not provide information\nthat can be used for system improvement and is just a reporting method. The metrics\nare more an assessment of the inherent K fertility of the system, the type of crop\nproduced, and the farming system employed.\nWhile production quantities are reasonably well known, the amount of grain\nretained on-farm for seed, animal feed, or domestic use is not often included. Also,\nthe area of crop production could be the areas of the country, of agriculture, of arable\nfarming, the area sown, fertilized, or harvested. The nutrient concentration of\nmanures and organic supplements included in the budget approach is quite variable.\nFor example, the sugar industry in Australia has an apparent high PNB K because\ncalculations do not often include K-rich by-products from sugar mills that are\nrecycled back onto cane fields.\nA second aspect of the uncertainties is the concentration of the nutrient in the\nproduct removed as well as in nutrient inputs. For example, Norton (2012) reported\nthat K concentrations in wheat grain varied by \ufffd14% of the mean value for dry grain\nof 4606 mg K kg [\u2013][1] . As a consequence, any PNB K or PFP K is likely to have a\n10\u201315% error embedded in the data used to derive the metric.\n\nThirdly, there are few reliable data sets on the use of fertilizers on different crops,\nand the best current data at the national level was reported by Heffer (2013),\nalthough regional agricultural and resource management groups may also hold\nsimilar data from farm surveys, various agricultural agencies, or the fertilizer\nindustry. Even so, not many sources disaggregate the data to fertilizer use by\nproduction region and crop, which is really the detail required for growers and\nadvisors to make system-level improvements.\nFinally, a single fertilizer application may carry through to a second and often\n\n\u2013\ndifferent crop, such as in a maize soybean rotation. The residual nutrient carryover\nand then removal by the second crop is not accounted for, similar to not taking\naccount of K released from soil minerals in the balance calculations.\n\nThe critical aspects of developing these metrics are to ensure that the data are\ntransparent, auditable, referenced, consider all nutrient sources, and are regionally\nrelevant and appropriate to the intention as to how the metrics are to be interpreted.\n\n\n11.1.4 Interpreting Nutrient Balance Information\n\n\nThe first and most significant issue to consider when interpreting a nutrient metric is\nthe degree of limitation that the particular nutrient imposes on the system studied. If\nthe nutrient is not limiting crop growth due to high soil reserves or other biotic or\nabiotic influences, then the value of PNB K and PFP K will be high, as little K fertilizer\nis applied relative to yield and nutrient removal. This can give an unrealistic\nimpression of the potential returns on K investment from the PFP K value and an\nover-assessment of the degree of soil depletion occurring from PNB K . In such cases,\n\n\n288 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nPNBI K may be a more accurate indicator of soil depletion since it is an extensive or\narea-based rather than intensive metric.\n\nWhere K is the most limiting nutrient, over the long term and within the bounds of\nerrors associated with the data, it is desirable for PNB K to approach unity, so that\ninput and output are balanced. When PNB K < 0.5, there is probably an opportunity\nfor using evidence-based nutrient management principles to improve efficiency. At\nthe other extreme, when PNB K - 1.0, it is likely that efficiency cannot be improved\nfurther without risking the depletion of soil supply. However, this should not imply\nthat PNB K values between 0.5 and 1.0 are necessarily acceptable, because, as\nalready noted, a PNB K value of, say 0.7, maybe good for some systems in some\nplaces and not so good for other systems in other places.\nWhile mean values are useful, downscaled nutrient performance indicators from\ndairy farms (Gourley et al. 2012) and grain farms (Norton 2017) are highly variable\nand generally skewed. While the distribution of these values can be informative for\ngrowers as benchmarks for nutrient performance in a participatory research setting,\nvalid comparisons can only be made among similar systems.\nTrends in efficiency metrics can be viewed in a broader background against\neconomic development in general. An economic Kuznets curve (Kuznets 1955)\nidentifies that as an economy develops, resource-use metrics like PNB initially\nindicate unsustainability (such as PNB >> 1) as resources are exploited, but then\nresource use becomes more sustainable as inputs become economic. So nutrient\nPNBs are likely to reflect the stage of economic development and agricultural\nindustrialization as well as production systems management.\n\n\n11.2 Australia\n\n\nIn Australia, grazing land accounts for 87% of agricultural land use, with 16% of\nland under improved pastures. Around 50 M ha is used for crop production, with less\nthan 5% irrigated. Farmers produce around 40 Mt of grains annually, with wheat\n(Triticum aestivum L.) (24 Mt) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (7 Mt) as the main\ngrains. Sugarcane (Saccharum giganteum (Walter) Pers.), cotton (Gossypium\nhirsutum L.), and viticulture are worth a total of around $4.2 billion annually,\nwhile other horticultural crops add another $8 billion. The Australian beef, sheep,\nand dairy industries are largely pasture-based, and the gross value of slaughtering is\nover $7.3 billion, while dairy products ($4.7 billion) and wool ($2.6 billion) are also\nsignificant industries. Grain and red meat production are highly variable due to\nseasonal conditions, and growers are careful with the allocation of production\nresources (ABARES 2016).\nAll the K fertilizer used in Australia is imported, and the annual peak quantity of\nimported KCl was ~480 kt 2004/2007, equivalent to ~239 kt K, assuming KCl\naveraged 60% K 2 O. The annual peak of K 2 SO 4 imports was 60 kt in 2012, or\n25 kt K, calculated using a 50% K 2 O concentration for K 2 SO 4 . Long-term K use has\nbeen ~170 kt of K, but during the \u201cMillennium Drought\u201d total K fertilizer use\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 289\n\n\n\nFig. 11.1 Partial nutrient\nbalance intensity (PNBI K,\nkg K ha [\u2013][1] ) across different\nnatural resource\n\nmanagement regions across\nAustralia for (a) 2007\u20132008\nand (b) 2011\u20132012. Values\nreported are the means for\neach 2-year period. In\ngeneral, the red regions\nindicate where nutrient\n\nremoval is more than\n\nnutrient supply. (OzDSM\n2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeclined to a low of 134 kt K in 2009, but has since recovered to 227 kt K according\nto the 2016\u20132017 report from Fertilizer Australia (Drew 2018). This amount makes\nup less than 1% of the global K used.\nUsing the agricultural production and fertilizer use data, PNB K can be calculated\nat national and regional scales, with regional fertilizer use data derived from farm\nsurveys (ABS 2016). In aggregate, the national PNB K was 2.9 for the audited period,\nand PNBI K was \u20130.6 kg K ha [\u2013][1], with the denominator used as the area of land used\nfor agricultural production. These values are consistent with the National Land and\nWater Resources Audit (2001) which reported that K use was around one-third of the\namount of K removed.\n\nThe patterns across different Australian resource management regions for two\naudit periods are shown in Fig. 11.1. The distribution of the balances largely reflects\nthe balance of enterprises within each region, as well as the inherent K fertility of the\n\n\n290 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nTable 11.2 Partial K balance (PNB K ) and the nutrient balance intensity (PNBI K ) averaged for\n2008 and 2010: mean rates are derived from the reported fertilizer use and the areas fertilized; the\nproportion of the total K fertilizer used by each industry was derived from the survey data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Industry|Partial nutrient<br>balance (PNB )<br>K|Partial nutrient<br>balance intensity<br>(PNBI )<br>K|Mean<br>application<br>rate of K|Industry<br>proportion of<br>K use|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Industry|Unitless|kg K ha\u20131|kg K ha\u20131|%|\n|Grain and<br>livestock|3.1|3.7|2|14|\n|Other grains|5.5|4.1|1|19|\n|Rice|6.9|14.8|2|0|\n|Cotton|0.5|\u201310.6|23|7|\n|Sugarcane|7.6|84.9|13|5|\n|Vegetables<br>(outdoors)|1.2|4.8|21|6|\n|Tree fruits and<br>vines|1.3|3.7|14|10|\n|Sheep farming,<br>specialized|2.9|3.1|2|4|\n|Beef cattle farm-<br>ing, specialized|1.5|3.1|6|16|\n|Sheep-beef cat-<br>tle farming|2.9|1.7|2|4|\n|Dairy cattle<br>farming|1.6|5.5|10|17|\n\n\nABS (2016)\n\n\nsoils. In essence, the areas where K was in the largest deficit were in the sugargrowing areas in Queensland and the lower rainfall grain-growing regions of\nWestern Australia, South Australia, and Central Queensland. It should be noted\nthat the data used to generate these maps did not include any recycled materials such\nas mill wastes from sugar processing or manures used as inputs into crop production.\nEdis et al. (2012) used farm survey data that included fertilizer inputs estimated\nfor each industry to disaggregate PNB K and PNBI K by commodity. These data are\nsummarized in Table 11.2, which shows that all industries except cotton have more\nK removed than applied as fertilizer. Cotton is usually grown in rotation with other\nannual crops so the true K balance is confounded by fertilizer practices on those\nother crops. There is much less K applied than is removed and the largest apparent\ndeficits are in the grains, sugar, and dairy industries. Recycled K-rich mill wastes are\nnot included for the sugar industry, and PNB K and PNBI K for the dairy industry do\nnot include K supplied to pastures that is ultimately derived from feeds purchased\nfrom outside the farm-gate. Gourley et al. (2012) reported that K from cattle feed\naveraged 25 kg K ha [\u2013][1] compared to a fertilizer input of 32 kg K ha [\u2013][1] from data\ncollected on 44 dairy farms across Australia, so that total K input in this industry may\nbe underestimated.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 291\n\n\nWhile it may be of interest to compare industries or regions, there are important\nlimitations in the data presented in both Fig. 11.1 and Table 11.2. The survey sample\nsizes are small which leads to up-scaling errors, and in these data, the up-scaled\nnational K use is about 65% of the fertilizer industry-reported consumption. Underreporting of K use in these farm surveys is likely a consequence of imprecise survey\nquestions that, for example, do not discriminate fertilizer product application rate\nfrom nutrient rate. Regional differences in product nutrient density, rotations used,\nand the extent of the use of recycled matter all make the actual values imprecise and\nof limited value in drawing conclusions about the efficiency of different production\n\nsystems.\nHowever, the major significant deficiency in these types of regional or industrybased data is that averages provide little or no intelligence to growers on their farmlevel balances. The data collected by Gourley et al. (2012) for the dairy industry and\nNorton and vanderMark (2016) for the grains industry gives error terms around the\ninputs, as well as the derived metrics concerning nutrient use efficiency.\n\n\n11.2.1 Southern Australian Grain Farms\n\n\nWhile regional performance indicators are of interest in a policy sense, the collection\nand collation of nutrient removal and use at farm or field levels are more important to\ngrowers, as these data inform them about how their specific management practices\nhave built up or depleted nutrients over time. Such an understanding will help them\nmake decisions about appropriate interventions to address any imbalances.\nNorton (2017) reported nutrient performance indicators from a survey of\n474 fields (34,900 ha) between 2010 and 2014 in south-eastern Australia. Nutrient\nbalances (nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P], K, and sulfur [S]) for each field over the\naudit period were estimated from fertilizer use, stubble management (burned,\nremoved, grazed), and crop yield. Grain and hay yields were recorded in the farm\nrecords, and regional wheat grain nutrient concentrations for wheat (Norton 2012)\nand canola (Brassica napus L.) (Norton 2014a) were used to estimate removal in\ngrains. Other values were derived from the values used in the NLWA (2001). The\nsummary presented here is for the K balances alone.\nEven though 20% of surveyed fields received K fertilizer, with an average K\napplication rate of <10 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1], where K fertilizer was used, the application\nrates were about 90 kg K ha [\u2013][1] on canola and 66 kg K ha [\u2013][1] on cereals. On the fields\nwhere K was applied, PNB K and PFP K were calculated with the median PNB K of\n3.0, and only seven of the fields surveyed showed more K use than removal over the\naudit period. Even where K was used, 12 fields had PNB K - 5 (Fig. 11.2a). The\nPFP K values where K was used had a median of 350 kg grain kg [\u2013][1] K (Fig. 11.2b).\nThe low use of K in eastern Australia in particular can be explained by the\ngenerally high soil test K values, indicating that supplementary K was not required.\nChristy et al. (2015) re-analyzed soil test data collected in the NLWA (2001) to\nassess the proportion of areas where a response to K was likely based on the soil test\n\n\n292 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n1     6     12     18     24     30     36     42     48     54     60     66     72     78     84     90    96\n\n\n\n500\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n1     6     12     18     24     30     36     42     48     54     60     66     72     78     84     90    96\n\n\nField number\n\n\nFig. 11.2 Nutrient performance metrics for K as derived from a survey of Australian farmers\u2019\nfields: (a) partial nutrient balance (PNB K ), and (b) partial factor productivity (PFP K ). (adapted from\nNorton 2017)\n\n\ncritical values (Brennan and Bell 2013). In the south-eastern grain-producing areas,\nsoil K concentrations are generally higher in the lower rainfall areas, but there are\nregions in the higher rainfall zones near the coast where yield responses to added K\nare likely. About half the K soil test values on sand and loam soil types in\nsouthwestern Victoria are low and these are coincident with the areas where K\n\nfertilizer was reported to be applied from the farm survey (Christy et al. 2015). In\nparticular, low soil K concentrations were seen on lighter acid soils under high\nrainfall conditions and also in formed-in-place Vertosols in both Victoria and\nQueensland.\n\n\n11.2.2 Trends in Potassium Removal\n\n\nSimilar to the high PNB K values reported in the NLWA (2001), Bell and Moody\n(2005) reported consistently negative K budgets for grain farms in the northern\ncropping region of Australia. The extent of the deficit was linked to regional crop\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 293\n\n\nproductivity and the low use of K fertilizer. Potassium removal was highest in\nchickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crops because of the higher than average grain K\nconcentrations in chickpeas being consistently higher yielding than crops like\nsorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Typically, K removals were between\n8 and 20 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] over a five-crop sequence. They also reported low and\ndeclining soil K concentrations in many of the summer cropping regions in Queensland. Soil test K values showed stratification with around 1.6\u20133.2 times more\nexchangeable K in the topsoil than the subsoil. This depletion has largely gone\n\n\u2013\nundetected by soil tests which generally represent only the 0 10 cm topsoil. There\nare now research projects investigating deep placement of K (and P) as a means of\nalleviating this deficiency.\nThere is concern about this depletion trend more widely in regions where K\nfertilizer has not been traditionally used. Key factors indicating a future K response\nare cropping on soils that have low to moderate exchangeable and non-exchangeable\nK reserves, and where K removal in harvested grain and hay is high. Indeed, the\nconsistently low grain K concentrations in some areas coupled with some very low K\nusage suggested that the soil K status may be approaching low levels\u2014whether due\nto stratification, presence of high sodium (Na), or the lack of substantial\nnon-exchangeable K reserves.\nPotassium fertilizer use in Australia is relatively modest on a world scale, and\nthere is approximately 3 times more K removed in agricultural products than is\nsupplied. While K removal is highest on sugarcane farms, there is a modest deficit\nfor most farms due to low productivity. Regional differences in K use and PNB K\nreflect the intensity of production and the inherent K fertility of the regions, although\nthere are inconsistencies in the data available to estimate K balances and nutrient\n\nperformance indicators. Western Australia uses most K fertilizer for grain production. Victoria uses K mainly on intensive pastures (especially dairy), while in\nQueensland K is mainly focused on the sugar industry. The data presented here\nindicate that grain-producing fields in the higher rainfall regions of southern\nAustralia are in significant K deficit, despite the low inherent K fertility. Private,\nstate, and federal agencies are addressing and communicating evidence-based nutrient management strategies to growers to overcome these deficits and improve\nproductivity (Norton 2014b, Norton and vanderMark 2016).\n\n\n11.3 Southeast Asia\n\n\nThe K balance assessment for Southeast Asia includes four crops most important\nboth economically and for K use: rice (Oryza sativa L., maize (Zea mays L.),\nsugarcane, and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) in five countries in the region:\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The choice of crops,\ncountries, and crop year included in the K balance estimation were based on the\navailability of data on fertilizer K application by crop and country. The latest\n\n\n294 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\navailable dataset with the highest number of countries and crops in the region was\nreported by Heffer (2013) for the crop year 2010\u20132011.\n\n\n11.3.1 Data Sources and Limitations\n\n\nIn 2010\u20132011, the five countries produced a total of 148.5 Mt of rice grain, 23.0 Mt\nof maize grain, 132.3 Mt of cane sugar, and 218.8 Mt of palm oil (as fresh fruit\nbunch) (Table 11.3). The total area harvested for these four crops was 57.3 Mha,\naccounting for 61% of the total crop area (94.9 Mha of arable land and permanent\ncropland) in the five countries (Table 11.4). For each crop, the percentage of the total\ncrop area was: 38% for rice, 8% for maize, 3% for sugarcane, and 12% for oil palm.\nFor the estimation of crop K removal, production data for 2010 and 2011\n(Table 11.5) was combined with published values of K content in harvested crop\nbiomass. These values were 2.83 g K kg [\u2013][1] for rice grain (Buresh et al. 2010); 2.38 g\nK kg [\u2013][1] maize grain (Setiyono et al. 2010); 1.1 g K kg [\u2013][1] cane sugar (Dierolf et al.\n2001); 3.87 g K kg [\u2013][1] oil palm fresh fruit bunch for Indonesia (Donough et al. 2014);\n\n|Table 11.3 P|Production levels of|f four crops in five S|Southeast Asian countrie|es, 2010\u20132011 season|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Country|Rice<br>production|Maize<br>production|Sugarcane<br>production|Oil palm<br>production|\n|Country|kt grain|kt grain|kt sugar|kt fresh fruit bunch|\n|Indonesia|56,349|6800|15,391|118,000|\n|Malaysia|2526|95|174|91,055|\n|Philippines|16,729|7271|21,913|565|\n|Thailand|30,700|4200|84,026|9160|\n|Vietnam|42,194|4607|10,783|\u2013|\n|Total|148,498|22,973|132,287|218,780|\n\n\n\nData source: USDA FAS (2017); oil palm production is reported here as fresh fruit bunch instead of\npalm oil as reported by USDA.

In rice, crop removal exceeded K application with a deficit\nof \u201333 to \u201383 kt K 2 O in Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand; whereas K application\nexceeded crop removal with a K surplus of 46 kt and 96 kt K 2 O in Malaysia and\n\n\n296 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nVietnam, respectively (see PNBI K values in Table 11.5). Across the five countries,\nthere was a K deficit of \u201328 kt K 2 O in rice-growing areas. Since the calculated\nPNBI K values only accounted for grain removal, greater K deficits are expected in\nareas where rice straw is also removed from the field (for off-farm use). Previous\nstudies reported negative K balances in rice in irrigated long-term experiments in\nIndonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam (Dobermann et al. 1996) and in rainfed lowland\nrice in Indonesia (Wihardjaka et al. 1999).\nMaize is the second most important cereal crop in Southeast Asia, with an area\nharvested of 7.64 million ha in the five countries (Table 11.4). Out of the five\ncountries, only the Philippines showed a K deficit (\u201315 kt K 2 O), while the K balance\nin the other four countries ranged from 0.7 kt K 2 O (Malaysia) to 80 kt K 2 O\n(Indonesia) (Table 11.5). Similar to rice, PNBI K calculations for maize only\naccounted for grain removal; hence PNBI K will be further reduced if K removed\nwith maize stover is included. Pasuquin et al. (2014) reported cases of negative K\nbalance in maize in Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam when most of the aboveground residues were removed from the field. In Southeast Asia, farmers manage\ntheir maize residues in varied ways. In the Philippines, for example, while many\nfarmers retain the residues in their field, some still practice full removal or burning of\nresidues to facilitate land cultivation, especially with the use of non-mechanized\ntillage implements.\nOil palm occupies the second largest area harvested, with Indonesia and Malaysia\nbeing the two largest producers of oil palm in the region (Table 11.4). While oil palm\nis only grown in four of the five countries, it is the biggest user of applied K fertilizer\n(69%) among the four crops (Table 11.5). Potassium applications exceeded crop\nremoval (positive PNBI K values) in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; while crop\nremoval exceeded applications (negative PNBI K value) in the Philippines\n(Table 11.6).\nSugarcane covers the least area among the four crops (Table 11.4), but it is one of\nthe important economic crops in the region and a heavy user of fertilizer\nK. Table 11.5 shows that annual application of K exceeded crop removal by\n0.8\u201343 kt K 2 O in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. On the other hand, K deficit\nis indicated in the Philippines (\u201316 kt K 2 O) and Thailand sugarcane production (\u2013\n30 kt K 2 O). A previous study reported negative K balances in Thailand for yields of\n30 t ha [\u2013][1] (of dry cane) and above at a K fertilizer application rate of 94 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1]\n\n(Trelo-ges et al. 2004).\nIn the five countries in Southeast Asia included in this K budget, the amount of K\nfertilizer needed to replace crop removal follows the order: oil palm > rice >\nsugarcane > maize (Table 11.6). To be able to replace crop removal of the four\ncrops in five countries, a total amount of 3.46\u20135.76 Mt K 2 O will be needed at\nfertilizer use efficiencies of 50% and 30%, respectively. With the current crop area\ndedicated to these crops in this region, the crops with the largest requirement for K\nfertilizer are: oil palm in Indonesia and Malaysia, rice in the Philippines and\n\n\u2013\nVietnam, and sugarcane and rice in Thailand. Based on 2010 2011 fertilizer application and the estimated fertilizer requirement to replace crop removal, opportunities\nfor improving K application are evident in most of the countries and crops.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 297\n\n\nTable 11.6 Estimated fertilizer K requirement to replace crop removal and fertilizer K deficit of the\ncurrent application practice at 30% (A) and 50% (B) fertilizer use efficiency scenarios in four crops\nin five Southeast Asian countries (expressed at K 2 O)\n\n|Country|Rice|Col3|Maize|Col5|Sugarcane|Col7|Oil palm|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Country|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|\n|Country|A|B|A|B|A|B|A|B|\n\n\n\nFertilizer K requirement to replace crop removal [a]\n\n|Indonesia|641|385|65|39|68|41|1834|1101|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Malaysia|29|17|1|0.5|1|0.5|1284|770|\n|Philippines|190|114|70|42|97|58|9|5|\n|Thailand|349|210|40|24|371|223|142|85|\n|Vietnam|480|288|44|26|48|29|\u2013|\u2013|\n|Total|1689|1014|220|132|584|351|3269|1961|\n\n\n\nFertilizer K deficit of the current application practice [b]\n\n|Indonesia|\u2013503|\u2013247|35|61|\u20135|22|\u20131059|\u2013326|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Malaysia|26|38|0.1|0.5|0|1|\u2013295|219|\n|Philippines|\u2013166|\u201390|\u201364|\u201336|\u201384|\u201345|\u20137|\u20133|\n|Thailand|\u2013327|\u2013188|\u201321|\u20135|\u2013290|\u2013142|\u201395|\u201338|\n|Vietnam|\u2013240|\u201348|\u201318|\u20130.4|\u201316|3|\u2013|\u2013|\n|Total|\u20131210|\u2013535|\u201368|20|\u2013394|\u2013161|\u20131456|\u2013148|\n\n\n\na \u2013\nUsing 2010 2011 crop removal data at fertilizer use efficiencies of 30% (A) and 50% (B) during\nthe year of application\nb Difference between 2010 and 2011 fertilizer K application and estimated fertilizer K requirement\nto replace crop removal at fertilizer use efficiencies of 30% (A) and 50% (B). A negative value\ndenotes a K application deficit\n\n\nFertilizer K deficits of current application practices (Table 11.6) are indicated in:\nrice for all countries except Malaysia; maize in the Philippines, Thailand, and\nVietnam; sugarcane for all countries except Malaysia; and oil palm for all four\ncountries. In the 30% fertilizer use efficiency scenario, there is a predicted annual\ntotal K deficit in the five countries of 1.2 Mt K 2 O in rice; 0.068 Mt K 2 O in maize;\n0.39 Mt K 2 O in sugarcane; and 1.46 Mt K 2 O in oil palm. Current production levels\nalso indicate opportunities for increasing production with intensification through\nimproved crop and nutrient management, which may require a further increase in K\nfertilizer application.\n\n\n11.4 China\n\n\nChina is the largest national consumer of fertilizer nutrients, accounting for nearly\n30% of global fertilizer use. From 1978 to 2015, total (N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O) fertilizer\nconsumption increased from 8.8 to 60.2 Mt, with an average annual increase rate of\n5.3%. The N, P 2 O 5, and K 2 O consumption in 2015 was 30, 19, and 11 Mt,\nrespectively.\n\n\n298 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n11.4.1 Potassium Use and Crop Production\n\n\nPotassium deficiency in crops was initially reported in Southern China in the 1970s\n(Lin 1989). Potassium did not receive as much attention as N and P in the next\ndecade but now has become a widespread limiting factor in agricultural production,\nespecially in some parts of northeast and north-central China (Liu et al. 2000).\nRecent research has demonstrated that K deficiencies in intensified agricultural\nproduction areas in China continue to be a challenge (He et al. 2009); however, K\nfertilizer input has increased dramatically over time, rising from 0.38 Mt K 2 O in\n1980 to 10.6 Mt K 2 O in 2015, with an average annual increment of 0.29 Mt\nK 2 O. The total grain production increased from 310 to 657 Mt during the same\nperiod, with an average annual increase rate of 2.1%. Fruit and vegetable production\nincreased annually by 6.4% and 9.8%, respectively, in the past 20 years. The\nunprecedented growth in China\u2019s fertilizer consumption and crop production in the\n\n\u2013\nlast decades prompted researchers to look at nutrient input output balances. Understanding the surplus/deficit and balance of cropland nutrients provides guidance to\nthe production, distribution, and application of fertilizer.\n\n\n11.4.2 Potassium Balance Studies\n\n\nPrevious research assessed farmland nutrient balances in China, including the K\nbalance at various scales (Wang et al. 2014; Chuan et al. 2014). These assessments\nemphasized that the nutrient balance estimations at the national scale would help\ndevelop national fertilizer policies, including decisions on investments for fertilizer\nfactories and the exploitation of local resources and minerals to supply nutrients.\nPotassium balances for the 30 provinces in China from 1961 to 1997 illustrated\nannual K depletion that increased from 2.9 Mt K (3.5 Mt K 2 O) in 1961 to 8.3 Mt K\n(10.0 Mt K 2 O) in 1997 (Sheldrick et al. 2003). Negative PNBI K (from \u201317 to \u2013\n245 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] ) were also reported from long-term fertilizer experiments in\nrice-based systems, irrespective of mineral K application and site (Zhang et al.,\n2010). Negative PNBI K persisted on wheat\u2013maize rotations even at K application\nrates as high as 112\u2013300 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] (Tan et al. 2012). A winter wheat study in the\nNorth China plain between 2005 and 2007 showed negative K balance in all the\ntreatments under different production practices, especially at high-yield levels (Niu\net al. 2013). About 79% of the assessed on-farm trials (n \u00bc 120) in potato (Solanum\ntuberosum L.) in north-western China had an average negative balance of \u2013102 kg K\nha [\ufffd][1] (Li et al. 2015). This overwhelming negative balance of K in soils of China\nstarted improving (becoming less negative) with the increase in fertilizer K application, along with the in-field retention of crop residues (Wang et al. 2014; Shen et al.\n2005). Several studies also show significant soil K surpluses in vegetable production\nfields in China (Huang et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008).\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 299\n\n\n11.4.3 Potassium Balances in Grain and Cash Crops\n\n\nThese studies provide critical information on K balances in China but mainly focus\non specific experimental sites or short-term observations. Nutrient balances can vary\nconsiderably from year to year, and short-term studies providing limited information\ncan be misleading.\nTwo follow-up studies in the past few years provide a more comprehensive\noverview on how soil test K levels and crop K responses changed over time and\nspace, and the status of K balances across China. He et al. (2015) used large on-farm\nexperimental datasets to assess spatial and temporal variation in soil test K and crop\nresponses to K between 1990 and 2012. The authors utilized datasets for plantavailable K from on-farm experiments, where soil samples from a depth of 0\u201320 cm\nwere collected and analyzed before sowing. The corresponding crop yield differences were measured between treatments fertilized with N+P+K or with only N+P.\nThe data were spatially desegregated and grouped based on geographical locations,\nsuch as northeast (NE), northcentral (NC), northwest (NW), southeast (SE), and\nsouthwest (SW) regions of China. In addition, each region was further divided into\ntwo sub-groups based on soil utilization pattern, grain crop, and cash crop systems.\nThe grain crop category included wheat, maize, rice, potato, and soybean (Glycine\nmax (L.) Merr.), while the cash crop group included vegetables, fruits, rapeseed\n(Brassica spp.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), cotton, and sugar crops. Results\nindicated that soil-extractable K concentrations (exchangeable K) increased with\ntime between 1990 and 2012. For grain crops, exchangeable K concentrations\nincreased only slightly; however, for cash crops, the K concentrations increased\ndramatically over the period. The trends of increased soil K in cash crops were\nconsistent with increased relative yield for cash crops and the high fertilizer K\napplication rates. The authors suggested that higher soil K concentrations under\ncash crops increased the average soil K estimations in China, leading to assumptions\nof surplus K in all soils. Even though extractable K in soils under grain crops\nincreased in the Northcentral, Southeast, and Southwest China in the 2000s as\ncompared with that in the 1990s, the average soil K values were less than the critical\nconcentration of 80 mg L [\u2013][1], except in the NW region. The results indicated that the\nexchangeable K continued to show a declining trend with large crop removal\nassociated with higher yields.\nThe PNB K was greater than 1.0 for both cash and grain crop categories,\nsuggesting that K removal by crop uptake exceeded K inputs from fertilizer\n(Fig. 11.3). The PNB K was higher for cash crops (mean: 2.1; range: 1.1\u20134.2) than\n\n\u2013\nfor grain crops (mean: 1.3; range: 1.0 1.5), indicating higher K depletion in cash\n\ncrops.\n\n\n300 K.

(2017b) using 31 provincial datasets from the China\nAgriculture Statistical Report for 1981 and 2011. The K consumption from fertilizers, human and livestock manure, straw return to field, cake manure, deposition,\nirrigation, seeds, crop removal, and K loss from soils were calculated with provincial\ndata and parameters from refereed literature. The arable crop output was the\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 301\n\n\nprincipal nutrient output pathway in the agricultural systems, which was calculated\nthrough economic yield and K requirement per unit of economic yield of various\ncrops. The arable crop outputs were categorized into five groups: cereal crops, fruit\nand vegetables (fruit, vegetable, and melons), oil crops (oil crops and beans),\nindustrial crops (sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), sugarcane, fiber crops, cotton and\ntobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)) and root crops (sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.)\nLam.) and potato). The PNBI K (kg K 2 O or kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) was estimated by calculating the total K added to farmland from various sources during the year (inputs)\nand subtracting the total amount of K removed from farmland by crop removal and K\nloss from leaching and runoff (outputs).\nThe farmland PNBI K was significantly different between 1980 and 2010 at the\nprovincial scale. The PNBI K in China changed from an average deficit of \u201313.6 kg\nK 2 O ha [\u2013][1] in 1980 to a surplus of 22.9 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] in 2010 (Fig. 11.4). In 1980,\nalmost 68% of the farmland area across 19 provinces showed K deficits (very low\nand low classes); however, 30% of farmland area in 10 provinces had PNBI K in the\nmoderate class (1\u201350 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) (Fig. 11.4a). In 2010, 40 and 44% of the\nfarmland was in the low and moderate PNBI K classes in 9 and 13 provinces,\nrespectively. Meanwhile, 11% of farmland was in the high PNBI K class in 5 provinces. Only 6% of farmland area showed a PNBI K in the very high class in four\nprovinces (Fig. 11.4).\nLiu et al. (2017a) followed up with a more comprehensive K balance across four\ndecades: 1980\u20131989, 1990\u20131999, 2000\u20132009, and 2010\u20132015. The data were\ndesegregated into six agricultural regions, based on geographical locations and\nChina\u2019s administrative divisions: northeast (NE); north-central (NC); northwest\n(NW); the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR); southeast\n(SE); and southwest (SW).\nMineral fertilizer, organic manure, and other K input resources (atmospheric\ndeposition, irrigation, and seeds) accounted for 33% (4.91 Mt K 2 O), 59% (8.85 Mt\nK 2 O), and 8% (1.19 Mt K 2 O) of the total K input from 1980 to 2015, respectively.\nThe K input through fertilizers increased from 0.38 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 10.58 Mt\nK 2 O in 2015. At the regional level, K inputs increased in all regions over time.\nIncreases in K inputs were greatest for the SE and least for both the NW and NE\n(Fig. 11.5a). By 2015, K input in the SE was the highest, followed by the SW,\nMLYR, NC, NW, and NE.\nThe average K output from 1980 to 2015 was 14.78 Mt K 2 O (146 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1]\n\nyear [\u2013][1] ). Crop removal accounted for 99% (14.63 Mt K 2 O) of the total output from\n1980 to 2015. Cereals removed 70, 65, 55, and 56% of the total K output in the\n1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, respectively. The K output of fruit and vegetables\nand oil crops increased over the years with average annual increments of 0.13 and\n0.05 Mt of K 2 O, respectively. Potassium outputs increased over time in all regions\n(Fig. 11.5). The K outputs in MLYR and SE were significantly larger than those in\nother regions. In the NE, K outputs increased from 1982 to 1989 then stabilized, with\nsome variation, from 1990 on.\nPotassium nutrient balance intensity increased from its lowest value in 1984\n(\u20133.23 Mt K 2 O) to a relatively stable value of around 2.1 Mt K 2 O in 2015.

The average PNBI K in the 2010s (2010\u20132015)\nvaried by region: SW (31.3 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > MLYR (15.9 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > NC\n(9.5 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > NW (8.2 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > NE (\u201311.9 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ). The NE\n\n\u2013\nregion stayed in deficit for the entire period of assessment (1980 2015). The positive\nPNBI K in the NW region declined over time. In the NC region, PNBI K increased\nduring the first three decades but declined in the 2010s.\nReliable K fertilizer use and crop output data, along with information from\npublished peer-reviewed literature, allowed estimation of K balance in Chinese\nagriculture. Recent assessments of K inputs, outputs, and PNBI K in China showed\nsignificant spatial and temporal differences. Widespread negative K balances in soils\nbefore the 1980s have now changed toward a more positive balance due to increased\nuse of K fertilizers and retention of crop residues in the field. However, regional and\n\n\n304 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\ncrop-specific disparity in K use provides opportunities to further refine the K balance\nthrough site-specific nutrient management for sustainable crop production systems.\n\n\n11.5 India\n\n\nIndia is the second-largest consumer of fertilizer in the world. In nutrient terms, the\n2.5 Mt of K 2 O consumed in 2014 was 7.7% of the global consumption. Alluvial\n(Inceptisols and Entisols), Red and Lateritic (Alfisols and Ultisols), and Black\n(Vertisols) soils are dominant soil types in India. The Alluvial soils in the IndoGangetic Plains and elsewhere have ample available and reserve soil K. Despite\nhaving high available soil K, the Black soils, mainly in the Central and Western\nIndia, often show positive yield responses to added K. This response is most likely\ndue to low K availability because of relatively higher contents of Ca and Mg in these\nsoils. The Red and Lateritic soils in coastal and peninsular India typically have lower\nK content. Heffer (2013) estimated that over 60% of the total N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O is\nused in cereal crops. Potassium used in cereals is about 50% of the total consumption. An estimate by Tewatia et al. (2017), using crop production statistics of\n2015\u20132016 and crop nutrient uptake information from multiple sources, showed\nthat removal of K 2 O by cereals is about half of the total K removed by all crops. The\nseeming parity between K applied and removed by cereals, however, is misplaced as\nthe removal of K by cereals is about 11 times more than the applied K.\n\n\n11.5.1 Crop Requirement and Potassium Use\n\n\nPost Green Revolution, India\u2019s agricultural production was largely driven by inorganic fertilizer use. The demand for crop commodities will rise in the future with\npopulation increase and changing food habits. Chand (2007) estimated that\n262, 19, 54, and 345 Mt of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane, respectively,\n\n\u2013\nwould be required in 2020, compared to the base year (2004 2005) production of\n\n\u2013\n193, 14, 35, and 262 Mt of the same crops. In 2014 2015, 235, 17, 28, and 363 Mt of\ncereals, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane were produced in India (FAI 2016). A\nslowdown of crop productivity (Kumar et al. 2004) and decline in PFP (NAAS\n2006), however, has been identified as major concerns.

Several studies identified\ninequality between applied K and its removal in harvested crops, which impacts\ncrop productivity, nutrient use efficiencies, and soil K mining (Naidu et al, 2011;\nMajumdar et al. 2012, 2016; Singh et al. 2014).

Potassium partial nutrient balance intensities were negative\neven with recommended fertilizer application rates of K and were least negative\nwhen farmyard manure was a nutrient source or wheat residues were returned to the\nfield. Although the K-supplying capacity of illite-dominated alluvial soils of the\nIndo-Gangetic Plains is relatively high (Dobermann et al. 1996), long-term intensive\ncropping with inadequate application of K have been associated with large negative\nPNBI K and depletion of native K reserves (Gami et al. 2001; Yadvinder-Singh et al.\n2004). Multi-location studies in the rice\u2013wheat system indicated that soil reserves\ncontributed on an average 258 kg K 2 O in K omission plots (Tiwari et al. 2006)\n(Table 11.7). Several researchers have assessed K balances in systematic ways\ncontributing to our understanding at various scales.\n\n\n11.5.2 Potassium Balance at the Country Scale\n\n\nThe K partial nutrient balance intensity in most soils of India was largely negative as\ncrop removal far exceeded K additions through manures and fertilizers. Tandon\n(2004) reported an annual negative PNBI of \u20139.7 Mt of N+P+K in 1999\u20132000, of\nwhich 19% was N, 12% was P, and 69% was K. Satyanarayana and Tewatia (2009)\nestimated K balances in major agriculturally important states of India. Besides the\nmajor field crops, the authors considered the removal of nutrients by fruits and\nvegetables in all the states; tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze), coffee (Coffea spp.),\njute (Corchorus capsularis L.), rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A. Juss.)\nM\u00fcll.Arg.), and other plantation crops in states wherever applicable; and the total\nproduction values of commodities were multiplied by the nutrient uptake coefficient\nto arrive at nutrient removal figures. The authors used crop production, state fertilizer\n\n\n306 K.

Nutrient additions only through fertilizer was used\nwhere information on other nutrient sources was not available. The overall negative\nK balance was estimated at 9.7 Mt, and the western region (3.8 Mt) had the highest\nshare, followed by northern (2.6 Mt), eastern (1.9 Mt), and southern (1.3 Mt) regions\n(Table 11.8).\nDutta et al. (2013) estimated PNBI K in different states of India using the IPNI\nNuGIS approach (Fixen et al. 2012). The study used the K addition through\ninorganic and organic sources and the removal by key crops to estimate the K\nbudget. The authors used data for fertilizer and the total amount of recoverable\nmanure used in different states from various sources (DAC 2011; FAI 2007, 2011).\nThe amount of manure consumed in each state was multiplied by a coefficient, based\non average K content in recoverable manure, to estimate the K 2 O contribution from\norganic sources. The K 2 O removal by crops was calculated by multiplying production with K 2 O removal coefficient (GOI 2020; FAI 2007, 2011). The crops considered in this study were rice, wheat, maize, barley, chickpea, pigeon pea (Cajanus\ncajan (L.) Millsp.), green gram (Vigna radiata (L.) R.Wilczek), lentil (Lens culinaris\nMedik.), moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq.) Marechal), groundnut (Arachis\nhypogaea L.), sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), mustard (Brassica juncea (L.)\nCzern.), linseed, (Linum usitatissimum L.) cotton, and sugarcane. The study reported\nlarge negative PNBI K values in northern, western, and eastern regions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe authors attributed the negative PNBI K in most states of India to inadequate\napplication of K, high removal of K by intensive cropping, and export of crop\nresidues. They cautioned that negative PNBI K in soils is not a one-off phenomenon\nbut a recurring one, which will significantly affect the future sustainability of crop\nproduction.\nPatra et al. (2017), using the national soil health card database, highlighted\nsignificant decreases in soil K concentrations in areas of north-western India that\nwere earlier flagged as areas of high negative PNBI K (Fig. 11.6). Recently, Tewatia\net al. (2017) did an extensive analysis of nutrient inputs and outputs for all major\ncrops, including food grains and other cereals, pulses, oilseeds, forages, fiber crops,\nfruits, vegetables, plantation crops, spices, tubers, and sugarcane.

(2017)\n\n\nthe FAI database for fertilizer consumption and crop production data for 2015 and\n2016, and nutrient uptake coefficients were taken from several sources. Only\ninorganic fertilizer contributions were considered as inputs. The authors calculated\na net negative K balance of \u20138.6 Mt of K 2 O, which was 66% of the net negative\nN + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O balance (Table 11.9). The authors further desegregated the K\nbalance information at a crop and land area basis. The average areal negative balance\nwas \u201342.2 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] across all crop groups. It was highest for sugarcane (\u2013121 kg\nK 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ), fruits (\u201371 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ), and plantation crops (\u201358 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ), while\npulses (\u201315 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) had the lowest K deficit, most likely due to low productivity levels. The negative balance in food grains was \u201340 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ; however, it\nhas the most profound effect on K balance at the national scale as the major food\ngrain crops (rice, wheat, and maize) cover nearly 80% of the arable land.\n\n\n11.5.3 Potassium Balance at the Cropping System Scale\n\n\nCropping systems strongly influence soil nutrient balance. Two or more crops are\ngenerally grown in a sequence within a year in much of India, except where climatic\nor other factors restrict growing multiple crops. Yadav et al. (1998) illustrated how\nnutrient removal differs by the number of crops grown in sequence and by the type of\ncrops within the cropping system rotation (Table 11.10).\nCareful nutrient and crop management planning is necessary for cropping systems to avoid nutrient imbalances in the soil. Long-term intensive cropping with\ninadequate application of K results in K mining leading to large negative balances\nand depletion of native K reserves (Gami et al. 2001; Regmi et al. 2002; Singh et al.\n2002; Yadvinder-Singh et al. 2005; Majumdar et al. 2016). Therefore, adequate\ninput of K is essential to prevent further depletion of soil K. Fixation of applied K as\nnon-exchangeable K is also not ruled out in K-depleted soils. Evidences suggested\nthat the non-exchangeable K reserves of the mica-rich soils of the Indo-Gangetic\nPlains (IGP) were exhausted due to continued lack of K fertilization in intensive\ncropping, that raised their K fixation capacity (Tiwari et al. 1992; Bijay-Singh et al.\n2003). Singh et al. (2018) stated that short-term inconsistencies, if any, in crop\nresponse to K or changes in exchangeable K content in the soils of the IGP should\nnot guide the K fertilization decisions. Rather, adequate K replenishment matching\nwith annual K removals is required for the long-term sustainability of the rice\u2013maize\nsystem in these soils without impairing soil fertility. Soil K depletion is faster with its\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 309\n\n|Table 11.10 Nutrient removal in impo|ortant cropping syst|tems|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Crop sequencea|Total yieldb|Total crop nutrient removalc|Total crop nutrient removalc|Total crop nutrient removalc|\n|Crop sequencea|Total yieldb|N|P2O5|K2O|\n|Crop sequencea|t ha\u20131|kg ha\u20131|kg ha\u20131|kg ha\u20131|\n|Maize\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|8.2|306|27|232|\n|Rice\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|11.0|328|30|305|\n|Maize\u2013wheat|7.6|247|37|243|\n|Rice\u2013wheat|8.8|235|40|280|\n|Maize\u2013wheat|7.7|220|38|206|\n|Pigeon pea\u2013wheat|4.8|219|31|168|\n|Pearl millet\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|10.0|278|42|284|\n|Pearl millet\u2013wheat\u2013cowpea|19.9d|500|59|483|\n|Soybean\u2013wheat|7.7|260|37|170|\n|Maize\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|9.0|296|47|256|\n|Maize\u2013rapeseed\u2013wheat|8.6|250|41|200|\n\n\n\na Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.)

It is further aggravated when crops remove\nmore K than required as luxury consumption. The data presented in Table 11.11\nindicate that except for the crop sequences with a pulse or potato as component\n\n\n310 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\ncrops, all other sequences remove more K than N and P. The higher output: input\nratio for K compared with N and P indicated insufficient K addition under different\ncropping systems, leading to depletion of soil K (Tiwari et al. 1992; Singh et al.\n2015a, b).\nMulti-locational studies (Singh et al. 2014) revealed that omission of K in rice\u2013\nwheat cropping system resulted in annual mining of 158\u2013349 kg K ha [\u2013][1] from soil\nreserves, and the authors cautioned that continuous inadequate application of K in\nthis cropping system may not be able to sustain high productivity over time. In a\n\n\u2013\nlong-term experiment on rice rice rotations at Gazipur in Central Bangladesh, Mazid\nMiah et al. (2008) reported that rice grain yield decreased sharply in a clay-loam soil\nfrom about 10 t ha [\u2013][1] in 1985 to 6.2 t ha [\u2013][1] in 2000 in the K-omission plots, whereas K\napplication at 50 kg ha [\u2013][1] resulted in positive K balance and maintained rice yields. In\n\n\u2013\nanother study on rice wheat rotations in northwest Bangladesh, the application of\n54 kg K ha [\u2013][1] increased average grain yield by 25\u201330% of rice and wheat by 53\u201386%\nacross a range of demonstration plots on farmers\u2019 fields (Mazid Miah et al. 2008).\nBuresh et al. (2010) showed that near-neutral K balance in rice\u2013wheat cropping\nsystems in India would require 100 and 15% retention of rice and wheat residues,\nrespectively, when irrigation water contributed 125 kg K ha [\u2013][1] . Replacing winter\nwheat with maize in the rice\u2013wheat cropping system, with typical crop management\npractices in India, reduces PNBI K well below \u2013100 kg K ha [\u2013][1], which becomes even\nmore negative at higher system productivity. At a maize grain yield of 12 t ha [\u2013][1],\nthere is a net export of about 200 kg K ha [\ufffd][1], which is often difficult to resupply with\nexternal K applications until and unless crop residues are fully returned to the field.\nResidues are often removed for several reasons. Rice straw has several competitive\nuses. Maize residue is difficult to manage in the field, and N immobilization often\n\n\u2013\noccurs because of high C:N ratios in that residue. Nutrient depletion replenishment\nstudies in the rice-based systems in Bangladesh have also shown negative PNBI K\n(Timsina et al. 2013).\nOn-farm results from the AICRP-IFS (2012) showed negative PNBI K in farmers\u2019\nfields across locations and cropping systems (Table 11.12). Potassium partial nutrient balance intensity was influenced by the crops selected in various cropping\n\nsystems.\nThe \u201cSR+M\u201d treatment received supplemental application of secondary and\nmicronutrients, along with the same amount of N, P, and K as in \u201cSR\u201d (the state\nrecommendation). The addition of secondary and micronutrients to SR triggered\nhigher removal of K in most cases, suggesting that the application of limiting\nsecondary and micronutrients, even at suboptimal application of major nutrients,\nmay increase crop yield and removal of K.\nThe deficit in K supply will cause changes in K soil concentrations. Singh et al.\n(2013) showed that, in the absence of added K fertilizer, average exchangeable and\nnon-exchangeable K decreased by 13\u201318 mg kg [\u2013][1] and 26\u201341 mg kg [\u2013][1], respectively,\n\n\u2013\nacross 60 on-farm locations during one rice wheat cropping cycle. Another study\nassessing spatial variation of different soil K fractions in an intensively cultivated\nregion of West Bengal (Chatterjee et al. 2015) associated the low non-exchangeable\nK in parts of the study area with high K removal exceeding K application rates in\nbanana (Musa spp.) plantations. Non-exchangeable K is not measured in routine soil\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 311\n\n|Table 11.12 Potassium nutrie|ent balance inten|nsity (PNBIK) for se|everal cropping sys|stems|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cropping systema|Treatment|K2O addition|K2O removal|PNBIK|\n|Cropping systema|Treatment|kg K2O ha\u20131|kg K2O ha\u20131|kg K2O ha\u20131|\n|Rice\u2013wheat<br>(24)|FFP|0.0|150.0|\u2013150.0|\n|Rice\u2013wheat<br>(24)|SR|74.7|160.0|\u201385.3|\n|Rice\u2013wheat<br>(24)|SR + M|74.7|174.0|\u201399.3|\n|Rice\u2013rice<br>(24)|FFP|70.6|172.0|\u2013101.5|\n|Rice\u2013rice<br>(24)|SR|66.4|189.0|\u2013135.6|\n|Rice\u2013rice<br>(24)|SR + M|66.4|202.0|\u2013135.6|\n|Pearl millet\u2013mustard (18)|FFP|0.0|104.0|\u2013104.0|\n|Pearl millet\u2013mustard (18)|SR|54.0|116.0|\u201362.1|\n|Pearl millet\u2013mustard (18)|SR + M|54.0|122.0|\u201365.1|\n|Pearl millet\u2013wheat (18)|FFP|0.0|65.0|\u201365.0|\n|Pearl millet\u2013wheat (18)|SR|83.0|95.0|\u201312.0|\n|Pearl millet\u2013wheat (18)|SR + M|83.0|101.0|\u201318.0|\n|Maize\u2013Bengal gram (24)|FFP|0.0|133.0|\u2013133.0|\n|Maize\u2013Bengal gram (24)|SR|20.8|169.0|\u2013148.3|\n|Maize\u2013Bengal gram (24)|SR + M|20.8|181.0|\u2013160.3|\n|Rice\u2013green gram(18)|FFP|34.0|129.0|\u201395.0|\n|Rice\u2013green gram(18)|SR|66.4|161.0|\u201394.6|\n|Rice\u2013green gram(18)|SR + M|66.4|176.0|\u2013109.6|\n|Maize\u2013wheat(18)|FFP|21.6|53.0|\u201331.4|\n|Maize\u2013wheat(18)|SR|58.1|89.0|\u201330.9|\n|Maize\u2013wheat(18)|SR + M|58.1|97.0|\u201338.9|\n|Cotton\u2013pearl millet (18)|FFP|0.0|85.0|\u201385.0|\n|Cotton\u2013pearl millet (18)|SR|83.0|91.0|\u20138.0|\n|Cotton\u2013pearl millet (18)|SR + M|83.0|102.0|\u201319.0|\n\n\n\nFFP, farmers\u2019 fertilization practice; SR, state recommendation; SR + M, state recommendation with\nadditional micro- and secondary nutrients\nModified from AICRP-IFS (2012)\na Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum L.); cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.); green gram (Vigna radiata (L.)\nR.Wilczek); maize (Zea mays L.); mustard (Brassica juncea (L.)

Several assessments at national and cropping system\nscales showed that K balances are largely negative. Low application rates of K in\ncrops combined with high offtake of K at harvest due to straw and other crop residue\nremoval from farms are the major reasons. The on-farm studies showed declines in\nexchangeable and non-exchangeable K fractions in soils of intensively cultivated\nareas. Potassium fertilization decisions based on agronomic evidence are required to\nimprove crop yields and farm profitability and to maintain K fertility of Indian soils.\n\n\n312 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n11.6 Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\nSoil fertility depletion is considered one of the major factors limiting crop production\nin sub-Saharan Africa. Crop production in soils of low native fertility with little or no\nfertilizer application is depleting and unsustainable. Maintaining the productive\ncapacity of these soils through effective nutrient management remains a major\nchallenge. Nutrient mass balance in specific soil\u2013crop systems is a reliable indicator\nof nutrient depletion or mining.\nWhen estimated at different spatial scales, nutrient balances provide insight into\nsustainability challenges affecting production systems in the short- and long-term.\nAccess, price, and affordability of fertilizers are major production constraints in\nSub-Saharan Africa, especially for K fertilizers. The following sections outline the K\nbalance at various spatial scales in the region and how that affects crop productivity\nin different production systems.\n\n\n11.6.1 Potassium Balance at Continental and Country Scales\n\n\nAnalysis of nutrient balances in sub-Saharan Africa shows consistent negative trends\nthat result from the continuous cultivation of crops for many decades with little\naddition of nutrient inputs in agricultural soils in the region. Annual PNBI K at the\nregional level averages less than \u201315 kg K ha [\u2013][1] and ranges between \u20135 and \u201345 kg K\nha [\u2013][1] for various countries (Stoorvogel et al. 1993; Van den Bosch et al. 1998)\n(Fig. 11.7). The losses of K from the soil translate to about 3 Mt K year [\u2013][1] . The\naverage fertilizer use of 18 kg ha [\u2013][1] of N+P+K in sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in\nthe world, accounting for less than 2% of the world fertilizer consumption. This is far\nbelow requirements to prevent nutrient depletion. Potassium inputs from fertilizer\nare proportionally lower than N and P, as most fertilizers that are recommended and\nused in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa exclude K. As a result, the amounts of\nK applied as fertilizer are less than 3 kg ha [\u2013][1] . The application of K through organic\nresources is also limited and negligible due to low amounts of manures and crop\nresidues that are available. The removal of K in grain and crop residues and K losses\nthrough erosion and leaching combine to result in severe nutrient depletion. The\naverage yield of cereal crops which covers 80% of croplands is about 1.5 t ha [\u2013][1],\n\n\u2013\naccounting for removal of 20 30 kg K ha [\u2013][1] . Potassium losses due only to erosion in\nsub-Saharan Africa range from 3 to 15 kg of N+P+K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] (Henao and\nBaanante 2006).\nDespite the overall large negative PNBI K in sub-Saharan Africa, nutrient balances\nvary greatly among different cropping systems and agro-ecological zones. The\nlargest losses of 20\u201350 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] occur in the sub-humid savannahs of\nWest Africa and the highlands and sub-humid areas of east Africa and southern\nAfrica, a region with high potential for crop production and high population densities. Moderate K losses of 10\u201320 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] occur in the humid forests and\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 313\n\n\nFig. 11.7 Potassium balances for countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

The soils in the arid zones in southern\n\n\u2013\nand West Africa have the lowest K losses (5 15 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] ), mainly due to low\nnutrient removals from low yields.\n\n\n11.6.2 Potassium Balance at the Regional Scale\n\n\nPotassium partial nutrient balance intensities for regions within countries are highly\nvariable, similar to the patterns of K balances at the continental level. For example,\nPNBI K levels in Kenya are consistently negative, and range from \u20135 to \u201334 kg K ha [\u2013][1]\n\nyear [\u2013][1] (Henao and Baanante 2006) (Table 11.13). The Rift Valley region with the\nlowest balances is characterized by high potential crop production and intensive\ncultivation, while the highest nutrient balances in northeastern Kenya is associated\nwith arid conditions that result in both low crop yields and nutrient removals.\nRelatively higher K fertilizer use in the central Kenya Rift Valley is due to large\nareas of tea, coffee, and sugarcane production that receive recommended fertilizers\ncontaining K.\n\n\n314 K.

At such scales,\nvariability is driven by soil-forming factors, such as the underlying geology and\nposition on the landscape, jointly termed the \u201csoilscape\u201d (Deckers 2002). In contrast,\nvariation in soil fertility associated with resource management at the farm level has\ngenerally been overlooked, despite evidence that such operations affect K balances\nand productivity of both crops and livestock (Smaling and Braun 1996; Giller et al.\n2006). In addition, there are strong indications that K balances differ widely among\nfarms in different wealth categories and among plots at different distances from\nhomesteads (Shepherd and Soule 1998).\nDifferences in access to fertilizer by farmers contribute significantly to the\nvariability of fertilizer use. Farmers with more access to fertilizer use greater\namounts of mineral fertilizers (Tittonell et al. 2005) and tend to own more cattle\nand thus manure, thereby using significant quantities of nutrients (Swift et al. 1989;\nAchard and Banoin 2003). Consequently, K accumulates on farms with more access\nto resources, often at the expense of the poorer farms.\nWithin farms, soil fertility status of different plots on smallholder farms in\nsub-Saharan Africa may vary considerably due to both inherent factors and different\nresource management strategies (Tittonell et al. 2005). Smallholder farms consist of\nmultiple plots managed differently in terms of allocation of crops, fertilizers, and\nlabor resources, resulting in within-farm soil fertility gradients caused by management strategies a common feature (Zingore et al. 2007). In most cases, both organic\nand mineral fertilizer resources are preferentially allocated to the part of the farm\nused for growing the main food-security crop, often close to the homestead, while\nplots further away are neglected. Such management decisions culminate in the\ncreation of gradients of decreasing soil fertility with distance from the homestead\n(Elias et al. 1998; Vanlauwe et al. 2002). Even where small quantities of manure and\nmineral fertilizers are available, farmers still apply them at high rates by\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 315\n\n\nconcentrating them in small areas. For instance, farmers in Zimbabwe apply cattle\nmanure at amounts as high as 80 t ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] by concentrating cattle manure on\npreferred plots (Mugwira and Murwira 1998). The underlying reasons for targeting\nof nutrient resources to few fields are not fully understood, but important factors\ninclude farm size, distance of different plots from the homestead, restricted availability of fertilizers and manures, availability and efficiency of labor use, risk of\ntheft, and the need to reduce the risk associated with erratic rainfall (Nkonya et al.\n2005).\nPotassium application in African agriculture is low. Most of the farmland in\nAfrica is dependent on soils that experienced some level of erosion and nutrient\nmining. The exchangeable K concentrations of the soil are generally low because of\nthe high degree of weathering and a long history of crop production without proper\nsoil management. Farmers\u2019 wealth, resource management strategies, and access to K\nfertilizers all contribute to significant variation in largely negative K balances across\nAfrican soils. Improved access to K fertilizers and their site-specific management are\nkey to increasing or even just maintaining the productive capacity of these soils.\n\n\n11.7 North Africa\n\n\nThe North Africa region is dominated by the Mediterranean climate, with rainfall\nduring the colder winter and dry and hot during the summer. The soils of this region\nare varied but generally low in organic matter. In arable lands, the predominant soils\nare calcimagnesic, fersialitic, and clay-rich vertisols. Major land areas of North\nAfrica are under arid and semi-arid climate zones. Although lack of sufficient rainfall\nis the main limitation of crop production, nutrient deficiencies also limit crop\nproductivity. Even though most of the research undertaken in North Africa in the\n1980s reported that soils are well supplied with K (Ghanem et al. 1983; El Oumri\n1985; Stitou 1985), continuous withdrawal of soil K has led to a decline in soil\nfertility. Several areas in North Africa now report low exchangeable K and high\nspatial variability of K in soils (Badraoui et al. 2003). As K availability in soils of\nmost North African countries (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) is perceived to be\ngenerally adequate (Azzaoui et al. 1993; Mhiri 2002; Belouchrani et al. 2002),\nfertilizer K consumption has remained very low, with an average of 12% of the\ntotal consumed N, P, and K (FAOSTAT 2018). Potassium partial nutrient balance\nintensities show negative trends due to crop K removal with none or low K inputs. In\nsome rainfed areas, farmers do not fertilize crops with K, even when it is required,\ndue to the relatively high cost of fertilizer, which has led to visible K deficiency\nsymptoms in crops in the last few decades (Mhiri 2002). For wheat, the main annual\ncrop of the region, fertilizer recommendations are based mainly on N and P, while K\napplication is generally neglected. Research on K also became limited in the last\ndecades with the most recent research programs on K undertaken more than\n30 years ago.\n\n\n316 K.

Since the K\nbalance in these studies accounted only for K output by grain removal, greater K\ndeficits would be expected in areas where wheat straw is also removed from the field\nfor off-farm use. Previous research demonstrated that critical levels of K in soils\n\ndepends on soil types and crop yield performances (Badraoui et al. 2002; Aissa and\nMhiri 2002). There are large differences in K use between rainfed and irrigated areas.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 317\n\n\n\nTable 11.15 Potassium partial nutrient balance intensity\n(PNBI K ) of irrigated wheat in\nsandy soils of the Saharan area\n(South Ouargla) of Algeria\n\n\n\n|K addition|K removal in grain|PNBI<br>K|\n|---|---|---|\n|kg K ha\u20131|kg K ha\u20131|kg K ha\u20131|\n|0|13.86|\u201313.86|\n|60|22.13|38.87|\n|120|31.27|88.73|\n|180|38.66|142.34|\n\n\nHalilat (2004)\n\n\n\nThe expansion of irrigated area in North Africa due to incentive programs such as the\nGreen Plan in Morocco and the National Program for Rural and Agricultural\nDevelopment (PNDAR) in Algeria intensified production and increased K removal\nby crops. As a consequence, growers in irrigated areas use more K for industrial\ncrops, fruits, and vegetables. In the citrus sector, which represents one of the main\nexport crops in the region, K plays an important role in fruit quality (Hamza et al.\n2012). For irrigated wheat, research undertaken in the Doukkala region of Morocco\nshowed that wheat responded to added K fertilizer only when the yield was higher\nthan 5 t ha [\u2013][1] (Badraoui et al. 2002). The highest consumers of K fertilizer are\ngreenhouse crop production systems. For example, banana production uses on\naverage of 500 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1], strawberry production uses 400 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1], pepper\n(Capsicum spp.) production uses 140 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1], and potato production uses\n115 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] in northwest Morocco (Zerouali and Mrini 2004).\nIn Tunisia, the status of K in soils differs among three soil categories (Mhiri\n2002): (1) acidic soils in the northwest are generally low in K; (2) alkaline, calcareous, fine-textured soils located in the north are rich in total and exchangeable K, and\nare considered among the most fertile soils in the country; and (3) alkaline, calcareous coarse-textured soils, located in the center and south of the country and the\nSahel, are relatively low to very low in exchangeable K.\nIn Algeria, arable land is limited to less than 3% of the total geographical area.\nApproximately 8.7 Mha are available to grow cash crops, forest, pasture, rangelands,\nand scrub and alfalfa (Laoubi and Yamao 2012). The consumption of K fertilizer in\nAlgeria is low and represents about 11% of the total consumed N, P, and K fertilizer\nin the country (FAOSTAT 2018).\nThere are few studies on K mass balance in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.\nPotassium fertilizers are applied in limited quantities due to perceived high native K\nin soils. Potassium deficiency in crops, however, is increasing due to higher removal\nof K in intensive agricultural production systems with improved irrigation facilities.\nResearch evidence of better crop productivity and quality with site-specific K\nmanagement in the region suggests the need for higher levels of K inputs to crops.\n\n\n318 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n11.8 United States\n\n\nPotassium budgets for the USA were calculated using the NuGIS model (Fixen et al.\n2012). The model calculates K budgets for each county in each state for 1987, 1992,\n1997, 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Briefly, the NuGIS model considers the\nsum of nutrient removal by up to 21 major crops as the only output: alfalfa\n(Medicago sativa L.), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), barley, common bean\n(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), canola, maize grain, maize silage, cotton, hay (various\ncrops other than alfalfa), orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), peanut (Arachis\nhypogaea L.), potato, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugarcane, sunflower,\nsweet corn (Zea mays L.), tobacco, and wheat. The model uses crop-specific K\nremoval rates (g K kg [\u2013][1] yield) and does not consider spatiotemporal variability. The\nnutrient inputs considered by the model are fertilizer and manure.\nA map PNB K for the contiguous 48 states of the USA is shown in Fig. 11.8. A\nPNB K - 1 dominates the more arid western half of the USA where soil K levels have\nhistorically been higher and where K application rates have generally been lower.\nBased on the distribution of PNB K (Fig. 11.8), the USA was divided into four\ngroups, and trends in PNB K over time were assessed (Fig. 11.9). Temporal trends\nwere evaluated through linear regression of the log of PNB K calculated for each\nregional group as well as for the USA.

Similar increases\n(1.1% year [\u2013][1] ) were also observed in the northeastern states (Group A) and the corn\nand soybean-growing states (Group B). States in Group D had the greatest increase\nin K removal to use (1.8% year [\u2013][1] ). Much of this area is where cotton has traditionally\nbeen grown, although cotton production has declined in recent years and is being\nreplaced by other crops, such as soybean. In the more arid western states (Group C),\n\n\n320 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nno significant trend emerged over time. Soil K concentrations have historically been\nhigh; consequently, farmers have not applied much K fertilizer, resulting in a higher\nPNB K, averaging 3.63.\nThe widely varied K-balance patterns across the USA arise from interactions of\nclimate, soil properties, cropping patterns, market conditions, governmental policies,\nand many other factors. In general, the combination of rather steady K consumption\nbut increased yields and therefore increased nutrient removal has led to negative K\nbalances that are becoming increasingly negative in much of the USA.\n\n\n11.9 Brazil\n\n\nSince the soil nutrient status of Brazilian soils is generally low, supplying additional\nnutrients is generally necessary to make agriculture effective and profitable. Potassium fertilizer consumption in Brazil is high, with consumption of 5.4 Mt K 2 O in\n2015, ranking second in the world, with about 90% of it imported. A nutrient budget\ncan represent the amount of a nutrient that is exported from the whole country, a\nspecific location (e.g., state), or a field by a crop relative to the amount of applied\nnutrient.\n\nThe nutrient budgets for Brazil have been calculated for the whole country, states,\nand main crops based on fertilizer consumed (ANDA 2010\u20132015), crop production\nfor the eighteen major crops in Brazil, namely banana, common bean (Phaseolus\nvulgaris L.), cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), castor bean (Ricinus communis\nL.), cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), coffee, cotton, maize, orange, peanut, potato, rice,\nsorghum, soybean, sugarcane, tobacco, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and\nwheat (IBGE 2010\u20132015), and the average nutrient concentration in the harvested\nportion of the crops (Yamada and Lopes 1998; Cunha et al. 2010, 2011, 2014).\nThe data from the most recent survey (Francisco et al. 2015) for an average of\n4 years (2009\u20132012) are summarized in Table 11.16. It is important to note that the\nMidwest region was responsible for 34% of the total K fertilizer consumption. This\nregion provides the bulk of soybean and maize production in the country, with\n\n\nTable 11.16 Average (2009\u20132012) annual K partial nutrient balance intensities (PNBI K ) and\npartial nutrient balances (PNB K ) for regions in Brazil\n\n|Region|Crop removal of K|Applied K|PNBI<br>K|PNB<br>K|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Region|Mt K2O|Mt K2O|Mt K2O||\n|South|0.91|0.96|0.05|0.95|\n|Midwest|1.06|1.29|0.23|0.82|\n|Southeast|0.66|1.02|0.35|0.65|\n|Northeast|0.30|0.43|0.13|0.70|\n|North|0.09|0.09|0.00|1.04|\n|Brazil|3.03|3.79|0.76|0.80|\n\n\n\nFrancisco et al.

In summary, PNB K for the whole\ncountry was 0.8.\nNutrient budgets for nine crops grown between the years of 2009 and 2012 are\npresented in Table 11.17. Potassium use was higher than crop removal in most crops,\nwith the exception of beans (1.20). Potassium use was most balanced in soybean,\nwhich had a PNB K of 0.99, followed by rice (0.86) and sugarcane (0.85). Coffee had\nthe lowest PNB K value (0.20).\nSoybean, maize, and sugarcane are responsible for about 70% of the K fertilizer\nconsumed in Brazil. The PNB K levels for these crops are very reasonable, compared\nto other situations worldwide, which is indicative that Brazil has had fairly appropriate use of K for these crops.\nIn terms of states (data not shown), there is a wide range of results in terms of K\nmass balance, with some states presenting very low and others very high PNB K\nlevels (ranging from 0.54 to 3.17 in the main agricultural states). The results from\nstudies at specific locations with K mass balances allows researchers to focus on\ncrops or regions with the most severe deficits. For example, coffee and citrus were\ntwo of the most important crops in Brazil with the lowest levels of PNB K among all\ncrops considered in the study. Consequently, it is necessary to better study fertilizer\npractices and management systems that could increase NUE, leading to improved\nPNB K levels for both crops.\nIn order to extend this analysis back to represent PNB for N, P, and K prior to\n2009, trends in mass balances of these nutrients between 1988 and 2012 are provided\nin Fig. 11.10. Nitrogen removal was higher than N input until the late 1990s. Later,\nN use in the country increased due to the adoption of more intensive cropping\nsystems with higher inputs, especially for sugarcane, orange, coffee, and maize,\n\n\n322 K.

Phosphorus PNB\n(PNB P ) has essentially hovered around 0.60, which may be acceptable when compared to estimates of 0.30 in many situations. Potassium partial nutrient balances had\na similar decreasing trend as N, and PNB K reached 0.67 in 2012. Potassium showed\na dramatic increase in PNB K in 2009 (0.98) that reflected a significant and temporary\ndecrease in K use by farmers due to higher fertilizer prices. The generally steady\ngrowth in nutrient use in Brazil in recent years has been effective in improving crop\nproduction, increasing average yields. In 1990, the average yield was around 1.70 t\nha [\u2013][1] and subsequently increased to 3.44 t ha [\u2013][1] 20 years later.\nNutrient mass balances were estimated periodically to help identify gaps in\nfertilizer use for specific crops or regions as well as to forecast future nutrient\ndemands. In this context, initiatives aimed at educating farmers and agronomists\non how to assess the performance of nutrient inputs are crucial for promoting\nfertilizer use efficiency, minimizing nutrient loss, and increasing crop production\nsustainability. With this in mind, a new tool was developed recently by Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o de\nPlantas Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (NPCT) in Brazil which allows the calculation of\nspecific nutrient mass balances at the farm level (NPCT 2020). Many agronomists\naround the country are using this tool to calculate nutrient mass balances for different\ncrops and farms.\nCalculation and publication of nutrient mass balances have helped agricultural\nstakeholders to better understand the status and efficiency in the use of different plant\nnutrients. For Brazil, the PNB K indicates generally appropriate ratios. Between 2009\nand 2012, the average PNB K value was 0.80, which means that overall, 80% of the\nfertilizer applied to crops was exported as agricultural products. The recently\nreleased web tool to calculate nutrient mass balances at the farm level is helping\nfarmers around the country better manage fertilizers. This tool can be adapted for use\nin other regions.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 323\n\n\n11.10 Southern Cone of Latin America\n\n\nThe total agricultural area of the five countries of the Southern Cone of Latin\nAmerica (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) is 238 Mha over a\ntotal land area of 513.6 Mha. Total arable land represents approximately 22% of the\nagricultural area. The total area for different crop groups defined by FAOSTAT is\n56.5 Mha. Field crops (oil crops, coarse grain, and cereals) lead the area and\nproduction in the region.\nThe main field crop areas of the Southern Cone include the Pampas and Gran\nChaco regions of Argentina and Uruguay, the southern highlands of eastern Paraguay, the eastern lowlands of Bolivia, and the central valleys and southern volcanic\nregions of Chile.\nSeveral soil associations are found in this region. Mollisols are dominant through\n\u2013\nout the Pampas Chaco plains and Uruguay and are among the best suited for\nagriculture because of their high native fertility. Alfisols are also widespread in the\n\n\u2013\nPampas Chaco region. Alfisols are generally fertile, with a high concentration of\nnutrient cations. Ultisols and Oxisols are the main soils in eastern Paraguay. These\nsoils have good physical qualities but require high lime and phosphorus inputs.\nVertisols are mainly located in the central-eastern region of Argentina, in the Entre\nRios province, as well as in Uruguay. The vertisols have good nutrient concentrations, but challenging soil physical properties that demand careful management.\nAlluvial soils dominate the eastern lowlands of Bolivia and also have good natural\nsoil fertility. Soils of Chile are quite variable and include Alfisols, Mollisols,\nEntisols, and Inceptisols in the central region, and Entisols, Inceptisols, Andisols,\nand Ultisols in the south. Native soil K availability is high in most of the cropping\nareas of the Southern Cone of Latin America (Barbaz\u00e1n et al. 2012; Sainz Rozas\net al. 2013). Thus, fertilizer K consumption in the region has been low, about\n335\u2013425 kt K 2 O in the last years (summed across the individual country consumptions shown in Fig. 11.11). However, expansion of agriculture into new areas and\nreplacement of pastures by annual crops, mainly soybean, in the last 20 years\n(Wingeyer et al. 2015) have increased K removal by grains and induced K deficiencies in several regions of Uruguay (Barbaz\u00e1n et al. 2012, 2017), and some areas of\nParaguay and Argentina.\nIn Argentina, the apparent consumption of K as fertilizers reached a peak of 54 kt\nK 2 O (44 kt K) by 2007 (Fig. 11.11). An annual PNB K has been estimated for the four\nmajor grain crops (soybean, corn, wheat, and sunflower) considering K application\nand grain K removal (Garc\u00eda and Gonz\u00e1lez Sanjuan 2016). This estimation used\naverage grain K concentration for the four crops and assumed that crop residues were\nnot removed from fields, a typical practice under no-tillage agriculture in Argentina.\nThe PNB K has been very high, with K removal exceeding K application by\nalmost 800 times during the period 2012\u20132014 (Fig. 11.12). Negative K mass\n\n\u2013\nbalances have reduced soil K availability (0 20-cm depth) to the current soil test\nK levels of 370\u2013750 mg K kg [\u2013][1] in agricultural fields in the central Pampas (Correndo\net al. 2013). This is a 32\u201362% reduction from the pristine (pre-agriculture) soil test K\n\n\n324 K.

Areas in northwestern Argentina under continuous sugarcane production for more than 50 years without K inputs\nhave decreased soil K concentrations to low enough levels that crops now respond to\nK fertilization (P\u00e9rez Zamora 2015).\nConsumption of fertilizer K in Bolivia is very low, with an annual average of\napproximately 4.4 kt during 2012\u20132014 (FAOSTAT 2017).

Continuous\nremoval of soil K without replacement will eventually result in soil fertility declines\nadversely affecting crop yields and farm profitability.\nMancassola and Casanova (2015) estimated a comprehensive nutrient balance for\nagricultural production of Uruguay. In their study, nutrient removal was estimated\nfor: field crop production; beef, dairy, and wool production; fruit and vegetable\nproduction; and forest production. Nutrient concentrations were gathered from local\ninformation and from literature. Nutrient application was estimated from fertilizer\nimports. In 2010, estimated PNBI K was approximately \u201324 kt K 2 O (\u201320 kt K)\n(Fig. 11.14). These negative PNBI K levels were observed for most of the production\nsystems because of low K fertilization rates, with the exception of vegetables and\nfruits. Furthermore, as soybean area increased in the last two decades, PNBI K in the\nsoil has become more negative due to the high K requirements of soybean. Considering an average grain K content in 3.6 Mt of soybean exports, it is estimated that\napproximately 63 kt K 2 O was removed from the soil in 2014. In addition, agriculture\nhas also expanded to marginal soils in the north-central and eastern regions of the\ncountry, where soils with low soil test K levels are common (Fig. 11.15). As a result,\nK deficiencies in crops have been evident since the early 2000s (Barbaz\u00e1n et al.\n2012, 2017).\nMost of Paraguay\u2019s agricultural production takes place in the eastern half of the\ncountry on lateritic soils (mainly Oxisols and Ultisols) and includes soybean as a\n\n\n326 K.

Causarano\nMedina (2017) estimated nutrient mass balances for the period between 1996 and\n2015, considering K fertilizer imports and K removal with soybean, maize, wheat,\nrice, sunflower, and canola crop production. Figure 11.16 shows that PNB K in\nParaguay has decreased from 3 to 4 in the period between 1996 and 2003 to a\nPNB K between 2 and 3 since 2003. Despite this improvement in PNB K, it is still\nmuch greater than 1, indicating that soil K reserves are being heavily relied upon to\nprovide K for an increasingly productive agriculture. Recent surveys indicate that\n58% of soil samples are above soil test K critical levels [> 0.5 cmol(+) kg [\u2013][1] or\n195 mg K kg [\u2013][1] (Causarano Medina 2017).\nIn summary, countries of the Southern Cone of Latin America generally have\nPNB K levels > 1, with correspondingly negative PNBI K values, indicating depletion\nof soil K. In most of the region, crop production under these negative PNBI K levels\nhas been sustained from high levels of soil K reserves. However, K deficiencies and\npositive crop responses to K fertilization have been detected in areas such as\nUruguay because of the continuous decline in the exchangeable and\nnon-exchangeable soil K fractions. Site-specific evaluations of soil test K would\nprovide information on the rate of decline of soil K supplies. Lastly, K application\ndecisions based on soil test calibrations would be required to sustain high crop yields\nand farm profitability and to maintain soil K fertility.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 327\n\n\nFig. 11.15 Pristine (pre-agricultural) soil test K concentrations at a depth of 0 to \u201320 cm, according\nto the soil recognition guide of Uruguay. (Califra and Barbazan unpublished)\n\n\n11.11 Conclusion\n\n\nEstimates of K mass balance provide insight into soil K fertility trends and potential\nshort- and long-term impacts of nutrient management practices in crop production\nsystems. The availability of reliable data to calculate K mass balances differs among\ngeographies. This is reflected in the scale, both spatial and temporal, and resolutions\nat which K balances are estimated and reported in this chapter. Table 11.18 demonstrates that the quantity of information used to estimate PNB K and PNBI K varies\namong assessments. Common to all, however, are estimates of K removed in\n\n\n328 K.

Besides the\navailability and access to quality data, a large diversity of land use and methodological differences in estimating K mass balances are also responsible for divergent\nmetrics reported from various parts of the world. Farmer income levels, access to\ninformation on K nutrition of crops, and translation of scientific knowledge to\nchanges in nutrient management practices also play important roles on how K\nmass balances develop in a specific soil\u2013crop context. This reinforces the concept\nthat nutrient balances are highly contextual and must be interpreted accordingly.\nNevertheless, PNB and PNBI K reported in this chapter, provide a useful global\noverview of how K is managed in crops, cropping systems, or in mixed enterprises.\nNutrient balances are too often reported as snapshots of a year or one cropping cycle,\nbut the trends over time are perhaps the most diagnostic of the sustainability of a\ngiven cropping system and its fertilization practices.\nTemporal changes in soil K balance over decades at national scales are useful to\nprovide necessary policy guidance for production, distribution and use of K fertilizers. China is such a case. The highly negative PNBI K levels in soils of China in the\n1980s have now changed to generally positive PNBI K levels, arising from increased\nawareness at the policy and user level, better access to K fertilizers, and their proper\nuse in the field.\nThe spectrum of PNBI K is tilted more toward the negative side globally as more K\nis removed with each harvest than applied. Potassium applications are typically low\nin historically high K soils (e.g., countries in the Latin America Southern Cone,\nNorth Africa, Western USA), due to an historic lack of crop yield responses.\nHowever, crops growing in some soils in these regions are now responding to K\nfertilizer applications, and crops are more frequently showing deficiency symptoms\nwhen no K is applied. A combination of negative PNBI K and crop response to K\nfertilizer is an unambiguous indication of K fertility decline.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 329\n\n\n|Input|Atm. deposition|Col3|Col4|Col5|X|X|Col8|X|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|Col25|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Input|Planted biomass||||X|X|||||||||||||||||||\n|Input|Erosion|||||||X|||||||||||||||||\n|Input|Run-off|||||||X|||||||||||||||||\n|Input|Irrigation||||X|X||X|||||||||X||||||||\n|Input|Org. fert.||||X|X|X|X|X|X|||||||X|||X|||||\n|Input|Inorg. fert.|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|\n|Mass balance metric (PNBK or PNBIK)|Mass balance metric (PNBK or PNBIK)|PNBIK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBIK|PNBK|PNBK, PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBK, PNBIK|PNBK, PNBIK|\n|Fig or table|Fig or table|Fig. 11.1|Fig. 11.2|Fig. 11.3|Fig. 11.4|Fig. 11.5|Fig. 11.6|Fig. 11.7|Fig. 11.8|Fig. 11.9|Fig. 11.10|Fig. 11.12|Fig. 11.14|Fig. 11.16|Table 11.2|Table 11.5|Table 11.7|Table 11.8|Table 11.10|Table 11.11|Table 11.12|Table 11.13|Table 11.14|Table 11.15|\n\n330 K.

The general perception is\nIndian soils are inherently rich in K and do not require further K fertilizer applications; however, overwhelming evidence of negative PNBI K levels at national,\nregional, and cropping system scales, accompanied by large crop yield losses\nwhen no K fertilizer is applied suggest that site-specific K management is necessary\nto maintain soil K fertility. Negative PNBI K levels and PNB K levels greater than\nunity indicate that a certain portion of crop requirements are derived from native K\nreserves. Irrespective of the soil K status, this process depletes soil K. How soon the\ngradual K depletion will impede crop production is a function of the magnitude of\nthe soil K reserve and the level of cropping intensity. Evidence suggests that soils\nwith very high K reserves will eventually become depleted under intensive cropping\nwhen adequate K fertilizer is not applied (the PNB K levels are much greater than 1),\ngiving credence to K mass balance as a reliable indicator of soil K mining.\n\n\nAcknowledgments The Grains Research and Development Corporation supported the research\ninto Australian farm level nutrient performance indicators reported here and the involvement of Ms\nElaina vanderMark and Southern Farming Systems is acknowledged.
