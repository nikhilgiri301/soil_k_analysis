The main goal of this study was therefore to investigate\nbiomass and nutrient [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)] content,\npartitioning, stoichiometry and internal efficiencies in sugarcane ratoon at varying yield\n\nlevels. Three sites were established on highly weathered tropical soils located in the\nSoutheast region of Brazil. At all sites, seasonal biomass and nutrient uptake patterns\n\nwere synthesized from four sampling times taken throughout the sugarcane ratoon\nseason. In-season nutrient partitioning (in diverse plant components), internal efficiencies\n(yield to nutrient content ratio) and nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K) were determined at\n\nharvesting. Sugarcane exhibited three distinct phases of plant growth, as follows: lag,\n\nexponential\u2013linear, and stationary. Across sites, nutrient requirement per unit of yield was\n\n1.4 kg N, 0.24 kg P, and 2.7 kg K per Mg of stalk produced, but nutrient removal varied\nwith soil nutrient status (based on soil plus fertilizer nutrient supply) and crop demand\n\n(potential yield). Dry leaves had lower nutrient content (N, P, and K) and broader N:P and\n\nN:K ratios when compared with tops and stalks plant fractions. Greater sugarcane yield\nand narrowed N:P ratio (6:1) were verified for tops of sugarcane when increasing both N\n\nand P content. High-yielding sugarcane systems were related to higher nutrient content\nand more balanced N:P (6:1) and N:K (0.5:1) ratios.\n\n\nKeywords: _Saccharum_ spp., nutrient uptake, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, biomass, internal efficiencies\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nBrazil is the world\u2019s largest sugarcane ( _Saccharum_ spp.) producer, with approximately 9 million\nhectares (ha) cultivated for biofuel, sugar, and electricity production (UNICA, 2015). In the\nlast decade, cultivated sugarcane area in Brazil increased by about 4 million ha, primarily\nin the Southeast and Midwest regions. The latter expansion was explained by the significant\nincrease in bioethanol consumption by flex-fuel light-duty vehicles (Adami et al., 2012).\n\n\n**Abbreviations:** CEC, cation exchange capacity; DAH, days after harvest; DAP, days after planting; DRIS, diagnosis and\nrecommendation integrated system; GDDs, growing degree days; GPS, global positioning system; HI, harvest index; HSS,\nhumic substances solution; NIE, nutrient internal efficiency; NUE, nutrient use efficiency; RIE, reciprocal internal efficiency.\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 1 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\n\nThe increase in cropland area is growing in parallel with\ntechnology investments implemented by sugarcane growers,\nsuch as machinery for planting and harvest operations. Due\nto environmental, agronomic, social, and economical reasons,\nmanual harvest with prior burning of sugarcane has been\nreplaced by harvesters, where dry leaves and tops (developing\nleaves and meristem) are now left over the soil surface,\nrepresenting an input from 10 to 20 Mg ha [\u2212][1] year [\u2212][1] of dry\nbiomass (Fortes et al., 2013; Leal et al., 2013; Trivelin et al., 2013).\nThis new harvest system has been called \u201cgreen cane management\nsystem,\u201d where \u223c80% of the Brazilian sugarcane fields previously\nharvested by hand with burning are currently harvested without\nburning by harvesters (Leal et al., 2013). In S\u00e3o Paulo, largest\nsugarcane-producing state, the crop is cultivated in 4.7 million ha,\nand more than 85% of the total is mechanically green harvested\n(UNICA, 2015).\nThe adoption of the green cane management system coupled\nwith other management practices (e.g., precision agriculture\ntools) may modify nutrient requirements for modern sugarcane\ncultivars. Traditional approaches to the mineral nutrition of\nsugarcane included a strong emphasis on yield with a focus\non a balanced nutrition, economic productivity, and quality\n(Kingston, 2014). Balanced nutrition implies that all essential\nnutrients needed for proper growth and ripening of sugarcane\nare available (Kingston, 2014). Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K)\nare demanded in large amounts by the crop, ranging from 150\nto 400 kg ha [\u2212][1] (Silva and Casagrande, 1983; Shukla et al., 2009;\nOliveira, 2011; Mariano et al., 2016) for sugarcane yield varying\nfrom 70 to 180 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Nitrogen is a major nutrient for plant\ngrowth and tillering processes (Kingston, 2014), while K plays a\nkey role on osmoregulation, which is important for cell extension,\nstomata movement, and enzyme activation (Epstein and Bloom,\n2005; Shukla et al., 2009; Kingston, 2014). Phosphorus (P) is also\nessential for tillering, root and shoot growth (Kingston, 2014).\nIn highly weathered tropical soils, usually characterized by low\nnutrient availability, monitoring the fertility status and fertilizer\n(NPK) application are essential practices to achieve and sustain\nhigh sugarcane yield levels (Franco et al., 2011; Oliveira, 2011;\nTrivelin et al., 2013).\nFor sugarcane, the nutrient ratio concept (also termed as\nnutrient stoichiometry) is not a new tool for diagnosing nutrient\nimbalances. Beaufils and Sumner (1976) developed the DRIS to\nevaluate N, P, and K requirements of sugarcane irrespective of\nplant age. Imbalances of these nutrients can be detected by means\nof DRIS before a deficiency can be diagnosed securely by means\nof threshold values (Beaufils and Sumner, 1976; Meyer, 1981).\nHowever, nutrient ratios investigated were unstable. Nutrient\nratios (N:P and N:K) changed during the stage of sugarcane\ndevelopment (Meyer, 1981). This occurs, because there is a\ncomplex interaction and dynamics of these elements within the\nsoil-plant system (Meyer, 1981; Shukla et al., 2009; Mariano et al.,\n2016). Besides this complexity, these studies did not properly\naddress the role of the nutrient ratios relative to the sugarcane\nyield. Second, previous research on nutrient ratios (N:P and\nN:K) for sugarcane probably were carried out in fields harvested\nwith prior burning, a different condition to the current and\nfuture scenario. More than 70% of the total organic matter and\n\n\n\nnutrients contained in the sugarcane straw are emitted to the\natmosphere via burning prior manual harvest (Mitchell et al.,\n2000). Therefore, the straw layer left over the soil surface when\nthe crop is mechanically harvested without burning represents\na significant input of organic C and nutrients to the soilplant system, which can result in long-term benefits for the\nsustainability (via C sequestration) and nutritional requirements\n(by decreasing fertilizer needs) of sugarcane systems (Trivelin\net al., 2013). Likely, nutrient ratios correlate with sugarcane yield\nin the green cane management system, but further investigations\nare required for examining this new research area.\nBrazil is one of the largest consumers of fertilizer, with\na nutrient demand expected to rise in the foreseeable future\n(IPNI, 2015). However, the country strongly depends on the\ninternational fertilizer market, especially for N (78%) and\nK (90%). A feasible strategy to reduce this dependency is\nto increase NUE, measured as sugarcane yield to nutrient\ncontent ratio (so called \u201cphysiological efficiency\u201d). Management\noptions for improving NUE from a cropping system perspective\nmust also consider both NUE components: nutrient recovery\nand physiological efficiencies (Cassman et al., 2002; Ciampitti\nand Vyn, 2012). In sugarcane, little is known about NUE\nfor green cane management systems. Vieira-Megda et al.\n(2015) investigated the effect of fertilizer N sources and rates\non sugarcane productivity, without documenting changes in\nbiomass accumulation. Similar results were reported by Otto et al.\n(2013), where among six sugarcane N-response trials, only one\nsite showed high yield response ( _>_ 25%) to fertilizer N. Probably,\nlack of adequate balance on nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K)\ncan act as yield-limiting factor in the green cane management\nsystem. Nutrient balances can help in closing yields gaps and\nimprove NUE. Therefore, plant nutrient ratios are valuable tool\nfor diagnosing crop nutrient imbalances (Ciampitti and Vyn,\n2014). The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize\ninformation on biomass and nutrient (N, P, and K) content,\npartitioning, stoichiometry, and internal efficiency indexes in\nsugarcane ratoon at varying yield levels at three site-years.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nSite Characteristics and Sugarcane\nGenotypes\nThree N-response trials for sugarcane fertilization were carried\nout in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Southeast region of Brazil. Two\nsite-years were performed during the 2009/2010 growing season\n(Sites 1 and 2), while the remaining experiment (Site 3) was\nconducted in the 2012/2013 season. At all sites, experiments\nwere established in the first ratoon cycle, and the plant cane\n(previous cycle) was harvested without burning the residues,\nleaving a straw layer (formed by dry leaves and tops) over the soil\nsurface. Conventional tillage (plowing, disking, harrowing, and\nfurrowing) and soil correction (application of lime and gypsum)\nwere performed, on average, every 6 years at all sites. Site 1 was\nlocated in Piracicaba (22 [\u25e6] 35 [\u2032] S; 47 [\u25e6] 37 [\u2032] W), in a Typic Hapludox\nsoil (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Plant cane (cultivar SP89-1115,\nreleased by Copersucar) was mechanically green harvested in\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 2 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\n\nMay 2009, at 433 DAP. Site 2 was located in Santa Cruz das\nPalmeiras (21 [\u25e6] 47 [\u2032] S; 47 [\u25e6] 11 [\u2032] W), in a Typic Eutrustox soil (Soil\nSurvey Staff, 2014). Plant cane (cultivar SP81-3250, released by\nCopersucar) was also mechanically green harvested in June 2009\n(456 DAP). Further details related to soil characteristics and\nfertilizer and by-product management history for Sites 1 and 2\ncan be found in Mariano et al. (2015) and Vieira-Megda et al.\n(2015). Site 3 was located in Sever\u00ednia (20 [\u25e6] 46 [\u2032] S; 48 [\u25e6] 45 [\u2032] W), in a\nTypic Eutrustox (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). The cultivar planted\nwas RB855453 (released by Ridesa), and the plant cane was\nharvested without prior burning in August 2012, at 442 DAP.\nAs related to the genotypes, cultivar SP89-1115 is marketed as\nearly ripening, average for yield potential, sucrose and fiber levels;\ncultivar SP81-3250 has a middle ripening, with high sugarcane\nyield potential, sucrose and fiber levels; and cultivar RB855453 is\nearly ripening, but also with high yield potential and sucrose, and\naverage fiber levels (Tasso J\u00fanior, 2007; Ridesa, 2010).\n\n\nSoil Characterization and Experimental\nSetup\nBefore the onset of the field trial, four composite soil samples\n(obtained by combining and mixing nine individual samples\ninto a single sample per block) were taken at 20-cm soil\ndepth intervals until 100-cm soil layer for soil physicochemical\ncharacterization. Soil pH was determined with 0.01 mol L [\u2212][1]\n\nCaCl 2 (ratio of 1:2.5 for soil and solution \u2013 w/v; van Raij et al.,\n2001). Soil organic C was determined by wet oxidation following\n\n\n\nthe Walkley\u2013Black procedure (Nelson and Sommers, 1996).\nAvailable P, K, calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were extracted\nby ion-exchange resins, and then quantified by colorimetric (P),\nflame photometric (K), and atomic absorption spectroscopic\n(Ca and Mg) methods (van Raij et al., 2001). Sulfur (SO 4 [\u2212][2] S) was extracted with Ca(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 solution and determined by\nturbidimetry, while exchangeable aluminum (Al) was extracted\nwith KCl solution and then determined by titration (van Raij\net al., 2001). CEC at pH 7.0 was measured by summation of\nexchangeable cations (K, Ca, and Mg) and potential acidity\n(H + Al). Base saturation was calculated by dividing the\nsummation of exchangeable cations by CEC, and then multiplied\nby 100. Clay content was determined by the densimeter method\n(Gee and Bauder, 1986). Physicochemical soil properties are\ndisplayed in **Table 1** .\nThe experimental design within each location was a\nrandomized complete block with four (Sites 1 and 2) or\nfive (Site 3) replications. At Site 1, treatments were fertilizer\nN sources [ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, calcium\nammonium nitrate, organo-mineral fertilizer, urea, and control\n(no-N added)], applied at a rate of 100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] . For Site\n2, in addition to the above-cited treatments applied at Site 1,\nammonium sulfate (100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] ) was also used. At Site 1,\nplots were fertilized with 75 kg K ha [\u2212][1], while 125 kg K ha [\u2212][1]\n\nand 15 kg P ha [\u2212][1] were added at Site 2. The sources of K\nand P used at both sites were KCl and triple superphosphate,\nrespectively. At both sites, fertilizers were manually applied over\nthe straw layer, in a band at 20 cm away from the plant row.\n\n\n\nTABLE 1 | Selected physicochemical soil properties at the 0- to 100-cm soil layer before the onset of field trials cropped with sugarcane at three sites, all\nlocated in the Southeast region of Brazil.\n\n\nDepth cm pH SOC [a] g dm **[\u2212]** [3] P S K Ca Mg Al CEC [b] BS [c] % Clay g kg **[\u2212]** [1]\n\n\nmg dm **[\u2212]** [3] mmol c dm **[\u2212]** [3]\n\n\nSite 1 (Typic Hapludox soil [d] )\n\n\n0\u201320 4.6 23 29 33 4.3 13 6 5 95 24 510\n\n\n20\u201340 4.6 19 29 50 4.6 29 12 5 126 36 530\n\n\n40\u201360 4.3 19 5 95 4.9 13 8 11 124 21 500\n\n\n60\u201380 4.1 14 2 107 5.5 8 6 13 117 17 580\n\n\n80\u2013100 4.2 13 1 105 4.0 9 8 13 109 19 530\n\n\nSite 2 (Typic Eutrustox soil [d] )\n\n\n0\u201320 5.5 17 8 27 0.7 49 13 0 91 69 630\n\n\n20\u201340 4.8 13 16 92 0.3 33 10 2 85 51 630\n\n\n40\u201360 4.6 10 2 116 0.2 19 8 4 69 39 640\n\n\n60\u201380 4.7 8 1 117 0.2 16 7 2 57 41 660\n\n\n80\u2013100 4.9 7 1 113 0.1 16 7 1 57 40 660\n\n\nSite 3 (Typic Eutrustox soil [d] )\n\n\n0\u201320 5.4 9 28 12 3.0 18 9 1 49 61 299\n\n\n20\u201340 5.3 7 33 30 1.4 15 9 3 47 54 226\n\n\n40\u201360 5.2 5 3 47 1.0 13 10 2 41 58 252\n\n\n60\u201380 5.2 5 2 50 0.8 14 10 1 39 64 298\n\n\n80\u2013100 5.2 4 2 49 0.8 12 11 1 33 71 275\n\n\na _Soil organic C._\nb _Cation exchange capacity at pH 7.0._\nc _Base saturation._\nd _Classification refers to the Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014)._\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 3 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\nFor Site 3, treatments used were rates of HSS (35 g organic\nC kg [\u2212][1] ; 115, 230, and 460 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] ), N (25, 50, and\n100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] ) and specific interactions between both factors\n(115 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] + 25 kg N ha [\u2212][1], 230 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] + 50 kg\nN ha [\u2212][1], and 460 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] + 100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] ). A control\ntreatment (without addition of HSS and N) was also used.\nHumic substances were composed by fulvic and humic acids,\nboth extracted and purified from peat, whereas N was applied\nas urea. The HSS and HSS + N treatments were applied\ndirectly to sugarcane leaves (foliar application), while N rates\nwere banded added over the straw layer, at 20 cm away from\nthe plant row. Treatments were added on September 2009,\nOctober 2009, and October 2012 at Sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\nPhosphorus and K recommendations were defined based on\nsoil test methods ( **Table 1** ), whereas target yield concept was\nemployed to predict fertilizer N requirements (Spironello et al.,\n1997). Biweekly precipitation and mean biweekly minimum and\nmaximum air temperatures recorded at each site are displayed in\n**Figure 1** .\n\n\n\nBiomass and Plant Nutrient Content\n\nMeasurements\n\nPlant measurements followed similar protocols at all sites, and\na complete description can be found in Mariano et al. (2016).\nBriefly, plants were randomly collected from 3-m plant row\n(\u223c30 plants) in each experimental plot, and then separated into\nstalks, dry leaves, and tops at all four sampling times (comparable\ngrowth stages in all sites). In our study, tops refer to developing\n(green) leaves from the stalk breakpoint to the apical meristem.\nSampling dates of plant biomass were performed at 139, 178,\n235, and 330 DAH for Site 1; at 133, 170, 227, and 331 DAH\nfor Site 2; and at 145, 198, 290, and 380 DAH for Site 3. Fresh\nsamples were weighed and then ground in a forage grinder.\nSubsamples of each plant component were oven dried at 65 [\u25e6] C\nuntil achieving constant weight, then weighed for dry weight\ndetermination, and ground to pass through a 0.5-mm sieve\nin a Wiley mill. Total N, P, and K concentration (g kg [\u2212][1] ) in\nplant tissues were determined by steam distillation (Kjeldahl),\ngravimetry, and flame emission photometry, respectively (AOAC\nInternational, 2006). Total aboveground biomass accumulation\n(expressed in Mg ha [\u2212][1] ) was determined by the summation of\nall plant components collected in each sampling date. Total N, P,\nand K content (kg ha [\u2212][1] ) in each plant component was calculated\nby multiplying each nutrient concentration by its respective\nbiomass value (in dry weight). Final aboveground biomass and\nnutrient content were estimated based on the last sampling date\nperformed at each site.

Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\n\nwhere _Y_ is the aboveground nutrient (N, P, and K) content (kg\nha [\u2212][1] ); _Y_ 0 is the intercept; DAH is days after harvest of plant cane;\n_A_, _B_, and _C_ are constants.\nThermal time was expressed as GDDs, which are calculated\nas accumulation of daily mean temperature values [(min.\ntemperature + max. temperature)/2] minus a base temperature\n( _t_ _b_ ), below which growth is assumed not to occur. In this\nstudy, _t_ _b_ was taken as 12 [\u25e6] C, an appropriate value for sugarcane,\naccording to Allison et al. (2007). For terminology purposes, the\nterm \u201caboveground\u201d will be used throughout the text to refer to\nbiomass and nutrient content in the following plant components:\ntops, dry leaves, and stalks.\n\n\nHarvest Index and Nutrient and\nReciprocal Internal Efficiencies\nHarvest index was calculated as the stalks to the aboveground\nbiomass ratio (all determined in dry weight basis) obtained in\nthe last sampling date performed at each site. Similarly, nutrient\nHI for N, P, and K were determined as the nutrient content\nin the stalk as related to the total content in the aboveground\nplant fraction. NIE (kg stalks kg [\u2212][1] nutrient) was defined as\nthe final sugarcane yield (converted from Mg ha [\u2212][1] to kg ha [\u2212][1] )\nproduced per kg of nutrient content (N, P, and K) in aboveground\nbiomass component according to Ciampitti and Vyn (2012).\nTherefore, the following equation (Eq. 3) was then used for the\nNIE calculation:\n\n\n\nSY\nNIE =\n\ufffd WNC\n\n\n\n(3)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nwhere NIE is nutrient internal efficiency; SY is the sugarcane yield\n(kg ha [\u2212][1] ); and WNC is the whole-plant (aboveground) nutrient\n(N, P, and K) content (kg ha [\u2212][1] ).\nIn addition, the RIE (kg nutrient Mg [\u2212][1] stalk) was calculated\naccording to Ciampitti and Vyn (2012), following the equation\n(Eq. 4):\n\n\n\nWNC\nRIE =\n\ufffd SY\n\n\n\n(4)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nsugarcane yield versus the aboveground nutrient content and\nstalk nutrient content for N, P, and K was assessed through nonlinear regressions. The model adjusted was validated utilizing\npreviously published studies (Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al.,\n2010; Schultz et al., 2010) as to demonstrate the fitness and\nrobustness of model calibration. The relationship between N\ncontent versus P and K content were also performed aimed to\nevaluate the N:P and N:K ratios within each plant component. All\nfitted regressions were determined using the SigmaPlot graphing\nsoftware (version 11.0, 2008, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA,\nUSA). The aboveground biomass accumulation, nutrient content,\nNIE, and RIE values obtained from all sites were stratified into\ndiverse sugarcane yield ranges ( _<_ 80, 80\u2013100, 100\u2013120, 120\u2013140,\n140\u2013160, and _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ).\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nAt the three sites, precipitation totals during the sugarcane\ngrowing season (equivalent to 12 months) were above the local\naverage ( **Figure 1** ). At Site 1, precipitation reached 1,862 mm\nand was 1.5-fold higher than the 81-year average (1,230 mm;\n**Figure 1A** ); precipitation at Site 2 totaled 1,691 mm and was\n1.3-fold greater than the 29-year average (1,330 mm; **Figure 1B** );\nat Site 3, cumulative precipitation (1,310 mm) was slightly\nsuperior than the 17-year average (1,266 mm; **Figure 1C** ). The\nair temperatures recorded at each site ( **Figure 1** ) were similar\nto historical average. At Site 1, minimum air temperature varied\nfrom 9.5 to 20.0 [\u25e6] C, while maximum air temperature ranged from\n24.2 to 32.9 [\u25e6] C. At Site 2, minimum air temperature ranged from\n11.8 to 20.6 [\u25e6] C, while maximum air temperature varied from 24.2\nto 31.5 [\u25e6] C. Lastly, at Site 3, minimum air temperature varied from\n12.0 to 21.4 [\u25e6] C, and maximum air temperature ranged from 25.7\nto 34.7 [\u25e6] C.\n\n\nBiomass, Nutrient Content, and Harvest\nIndex\n\nA broad range in aboveground sugarcane biomass was recorded\nacross all sites ( **Table 2** ). Sugarcane yield ranged from 67 to\n211 Mg ha [\u2212][1], averaging 125 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Aboveground biomass\nranged from 16 to 106 Mg ha [\u2212][1], averaging 57 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Stalk\nbiomass ranged from 9 to 66 Mg ha [\u2212][1], averaging 37 Mg ha [\u2212][1],\nwhile tops mass ranged from 2 to 30 Mg ha [\u2212][1] and averaged 11 Mg\nha [\u2212][1] . Dry leaves biomass ranged from 4 to 20 Mg ha [\u2212][1], with\nan average of 9 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Nutrient content within each plant\ncomponent also had a broad variation ( **Table 2** ). The content\nof N, P, and K in the stalks ranged from 32 to 168 kg ha [\u2212][1],\nfrom 5 to 57 kg ha [\u2212][1], and from 26 to 713 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively.\nThe content of N, P, and K in the dry leaves ranged from 19 to\n77 kg ha [\u2212][1], 0.6 to 4.9 kg ha [\u2212][1], and 2 to 96 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively.\nLastly, the content of N, P, and K in the tops ranged from\n17 to 225 kg ha [\u2212][1], 1 to 26 kg ha [\u2212][1], and 75 to 396 kg ha [\u2212][1],\nrespectively. As related to the aboveground plant fractions (dry\nleaves + tops + stalk), N content ranged from 86 to 425 kg N\nha [\u2212][1], averaging 197 kg N ha [\u2212][1], while P content ranged from 10\nto 79 kg P ha [\u2212][1], averaging 32 kg P ha [\u2212][1] ( **Table 2** ).

The biomass HI had a narrow range,\nvarying from 0.55 to 0.73 across all evaluated sites ( **Table 2** ).\nIn contrast, nutrient HI showed a broad range, varying from\n0.31 to 0.64 for N, 0.38 to 0.81 for P, and 0.12 to 0.82 for K.\nDetailed results about biomass accumulation, nutrient content,\nand HI for each specific treatment within each site can be found\nin **Supplementary Table 1** .\n\n\nBiomass and Nutrient Partitioning\nSugarcane biomass accumulation throughout the ratoon cycles\nwas characterized by a sigmoid pattern ( **Figure 2A** ). The nonlinear growth regression equation included data from all sites,\nand three distinct growth phases were identified, as follows: (1)\nPhase I (lag phase): from \u223c0 to 135 DAH (0 to 1450 [\u25e6] C GDDs),\nthis period is marked by a slow plant growth, accumulating\n\u223c10% of the final aboveground biomass relative to harvest; (2)\nPhase II (exponential\u2013linear phase): from \u223c135 to 270 DAH\n(1450 to 2800 [\u25e6] C GDDs), this period was characterized by a rapid\ngrowth that produced \u223c65% of the final aboveground biomass\nrelative to harvest; and (3) Phase III (stationary phase): from\n\u223c270 to 370 DAH (2800 to 4000 [\u25e6] C GDDs), this period exhibited\na declined growth, representing \u223c25% of the final aboveground\nbiomass at harvest. As related to the nutrient uptake, 50% of\n\n\n\nthe total N, P, and K content occurred at 212 (2259 GDDs), 209\n(2292 GDDs), and 214 DAH (2314 GDDs), respectively, while\n50% of biomass accumulation was detected at 250 DAH (2700\nGDDs; **Figures 2B\u2013D** ). Thus, there was an asynchrony (delay) of\n\u223c38 days, on average, between the date when 50% of the total\naboveground biomass occurred in comparison when 50% of total\nnutrient had accumulated.\nIn the partitioning process, Phase I was marked by the biomass\nallocation exclusively in the tops, as the occurrence of dried\nleaves and stalk was not visible at that growth stage ( **Figure 2A** ).\nHowever, an opposite trend was observed for Phases II and III,\nwhere most of the biomass was allocated in the stalk, followed by\ntops and dry leaves. The fraction of biomass allocated in the stalk\nwas \u223c65% of the total, which are similar toother studies, ranging\nfrom 60 to 80% (Coale et al., 1993; Inman-Bamber et al., 2002;\nShukla et al., 2009; Trivelin et al., 2013). The nutrient partitioning\nfollowed the same trend as verified for biomass accumulation\n( **Figures 2B\u2013D** ), although a higher proportion of N, P, and K were\nallocated in the tops than dry leaves in the Phases II and III.\n\n\nYield-to-Nutrient Content Relationship\nSugarcane Yield\nSugarcane yield was positively related to the aboveground and\nstalk nutrient content, with a less than proportional change\nfor nutrient content under high-yielding stalk observations\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 6 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al.

Both N and P showed a narrow relationship with\nsugarcane yield ( _R_ [2] \u2265 0.66), but K presented wider variability,\nthus resulting in non-significant relationships ( _R_ [2] \u2264 0.13;\n**Figures 3C,F** ). For the yield-to-K relationship, Site 1 showed\na range varying from 356 to 866 kg K ha [\u2212][1] for a comparable\nyield level ( **Figure 3C** ), whereas for Site 2, K and P may have\nlimited sugarcane yield with similar stalk K (70 kg ha [\u2212][1] ) and P\n(9 kg ha [\u2212][1] ) content, with yield ranging from 65 to 120 Mg ha [\u2212][1]\n\n( **Figures 3E,F** ).\n\n\nN:P and N:K Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\nPlant Components\nEvaluation of nutrient stoichiometry can provide an overall status\nof nutrient balance at a specific growth stage. Following this\nrationale, N:P ratio was established for all plant components\n(stalk, dry leaves, and tops) at harvest time ( **Figure 4** ). Bubble\ngraphs portrayed N:P content association as relative to sugarcane\nyield (represented by bubble sizes; **Figure 4** ). At the aboveground\nbiomass level, N:P ratio presented an overall balance close to 6:1\nunits ( **Figure 4A** ), although the N:P ratio changed relative to the\nplant fraction: 18 units for dry leaves ( **Figure 4B** ), 6 unit for\ntops ( **Figure 4C** ), and 4 units for the stalk organ ( **Figure 4D** ).\nThe tops followed a similar N:P ratio as documented for the\naboveground plant, which exemplify the critical role of this\norgan for C fixation and growth/yield, with a variation from\n\n\n\n3:1 to 11:1 ( _<_ threefold; **Figure 4C** ). High-yielding sugarcane\nobservations presented a more balanced N:P ratio (6:1 units).\nFor example, sugarcane yield of 120 Mg ha [\u2212][1] resulted in 70 kg N\nha [\u2212][1] and 12 kg P ha [\u2212][1] (N:P of six units) for the tops component\n( **Figure 4C** ).\nThe stoichiometric evaluation was also calculated for N and\n\nK, but more variation was present than the N:P ratio. The overall\nN:K ratio was of 0.5:1 units, ranging from 0.1:1 to 1.2:1 ( _>_ 10-fold\nvariation; **Supplementary Figure S1** ). Accordingly to the N:P\nratio, the N:K stoichiometry presented a similar variation range\nin the tops component relative to the aboveground biomass.\nDetailed information about nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K) for\ntreatments used at each site can be found in **Supplementary**\n**Table 1** .\n\n\nEfficiency Indexes on Diverse Sugarcane\nYield Ranges\nAs expected, both biomass and nutrient content followed\nthe yield pattern ( **Table 3** ). In low-yield levels, marked by\nyields _<_ 80 Mg ha [\u2212][1], the aboveground biomass was of 26 Mg\nha [\u2212][1], whereas aboveground nutrient content was of 117, 16, and\n233 kg ha [\u2212][1] of N, P, and K, respectively. However, under highyield levels ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ), the biomass was of 89 Mg ha [\u2212][1],\nwhile nutrient content was of 279, 50, and 560 kg ha [\u2212][1] of N, P,\nand K, respectively.\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 7 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al.

Each data point represents an individual field plot at sugarcane harvest of a first ratoon growing season for three\nsite-years ( _n_ = 102). Red symbols were gathered from previously published documents (Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al., 2010; Schultz et al., 2010; _n_ = 27).

Maximum NIEs [713 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] N,\n5962 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] P, and 478 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] K] occurred at lowest\nsugarcane yield ( _<_ 80 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ), while minimum NIEs [623 kg\nstalk kg [\u2212][1] N, 3649 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] P, and 320 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] K]\noccurred at highest sugarcane yield ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ). Reciprocal\ninternal efficiencies were estimated for low and high sugarcane\nyields (from 80 to 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ), requiring 1.3\u20131.6 kg N, 0.21\u2013\n0.28 kg P, and 2.4\u20133.2 kg K per Mg of stalk produced, respectively\n( **Table 3** ). Oliveira (2011) reported a similar trend for RIE, with\nvalues of 1.5, 0.21, and 3.1 kg of N, P, and K, respectively.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThe high yielding observations reported in this study were\ngreater than previous sugarcane yield values documented by\nothers researchers in Brazil (Gava et al., 2005; Prado and\n\n\n\nPancelli, 2008; Oliveira, 2011; Amaral and Molin, 2013; Fortes\net al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Rossato et al., 2013), Australia\n(Thorburn et al., 2011) and United States (Coale et al., 1993;\nMcCray et al., 2014). In this study, Site 3 represents a highyielding and productive sugarcane environment, likely explained\nby the combination of high soil fertility and utilization of best\nmanagement practices, such as variable rate fertilizer spreader\nand controlled traffic through GPS guided maps. It is recognized\nthat sugarcane yield depends on the complex interaction among\ngenotypes, environment (soil and weather), and management\npractices (Thorburn et al., 2011). Several factors can contribute\nto the scatter and non-linear differences in yield that affect\nits relationship between nutrients (Setiyono et al., 2010). In\nthis study, weather conditions, such as air temperature and\nprecipitation, were similar for all sites ( **Figure 1** ), with a main\ndifference related to the soil type and fertility status ( **Table 1** ).\nFor example, in Site 1, average pH (4.3 units) and base saturation\n(23%) were relatively low at all evaluated soil-depth intervals,\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 8 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\nFIGURE 4 | Relationships between N versus P content for all plant components: aboveground biomass (A), dry leaves (B), tops (C), and stalks (D).\nEach data point represents an individual field plot at sugarcane harvest of a first ratoon growing season for three site-years ( _n_ = 102). Dotted lines show boundary\nratios for each component between N versus P, and black line shows the average value.\n\n\n\naccompanied with high Al content (9.5 mmol c dm [\u2212][3] ) when\ncompared to Site 3 ( **Table 1** ). For Site 2, the main limiting\nfactors were K (0.3 mmol c dm [\u2212][3] ) and P (5.6 mg dm [\u2212][3] ) levels.\nIn summary, Sites 1 and 2 presented initial soil conditions that\ncould constraint and severely affect sugarcane yield potential\nrelative to Site 3. In agreement, Dias et al. (1999), documented\na strong correlation between sugarcane yields and chemical\nproperties (e.g., CEC, base saturation, exchangeable Ca, Mg, and\nAl, potential acidity, etc.) of subsurface horizons (25\u2013150 cm) of\nsix weathered soils. Treatment effect was more pronounced on\nSites 1 and 2 than Site 3 ( **Supplementary Table 1** ), which was\nlikely due to variations in soil chemical properties as described\nabove.\nAlthough the aboveground N content presented a broad\nvariation, the overall absolute value was similar with others\nstudies (Wood et al., 1996; Oliveira et al., 2010; Franco et al.,\n2011). Wood et al. (1996) documented total N content values\nranging from 212 to 254 kg N ha [\u2212][1] for several sugarcane\ncultivars. Franco et al. (2011) found total N content values\nranging from 95 to 154 kg ha [\u2212][1], while sugarcane yield ranged\nbetween 77 and 122 Mg ha [\u2212][1] at the same study sites (Franco\net al., 2015). Oliveira et al. (2010) reported that N content ranged\nbetween 94 and 260 kg N ha [\u2212][1], while sugarcane yield ranged\nfrom 120 to 232 Mg ha [\u2212][1] for 11 sugarcane cultivars under\nirrigation in northeastern Brazil. Differences in N content could\nbe explained by the higher yields obtained in the present study\n(average of 125 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ). Other N sources rather than mineral\nfertilizer (e.g., soil N mineralization, atmospheric deposition,\n\n\n\nand biological N fixation by endophytic bacteria) can provide\ndifferent amount of N for sugarcane crop (Urquiaga et al., 2012;\nMariano et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Vieira-Megda et al., 2015).\nFor this study, aboveground P content presented a similar range\nfrom 21 to 39 kg P ha [\u2212][1] as reported by several researchers\n(Rakkiyappan et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al.,\n2010). As related to the K content, Coale et al. (1993) and Shukla\net al. (2009) reported lower values for K content removal by crop\nharvest of 340 and 228 kg K ha [\u2212][1] with sugarcane yield of 96 and\n80 Mg ha [\u2212][1], respectively. For our study, high K content might\nhave been influenced by the soil nutrient content presented at\nSite 1, where soil K level was \u22654.0 mmol c dm [\u2212][3] throughout the\nsoil profile ( **Table 1** ). This experimental site has a long history\nof annual applications of vinasse and press mud. As vinasse has\na high K content, amendment of this by-product might have\ngradually enriched soil K content (Resende et al., 2006). Thus,\nscientific literature is available portraying the critical role of\nsustaining an adequate K content for increasing sugarcane yields\n(Shukla et al., 2009).\nUnder optimal water, solar radiation, and temperature\nconditions, nutrient supply is the primary limiting factor\naffecting the process of biomass accumulation (Donaldson et al.,\n2008; van Heerden et al., 2010). For this study, a similar\nbiomass accumulation pattern was previously described by others\nauthors for plant cane and ratoon cycles for a broad range\nof cultivars, soil characteristics, and environmental conditions\n(Machado et al., 1982; Coale et al., 1993; Inman-Bamber et al.,\n2002; Gava et al., 2005).

The slow growth is\nrelated to the slow tillering and leaf production during plant\nestablishment (Bell and Garside, 2005; Allison et al., 2007).\nPhase II is characterized by an exponential\u2013linear biomass\naccumulation, consisting in leaf canopy and stalks production.\nAfter canopy establishment, the sugarcane is high efficient in\nconverting intercepted light into biomass (Rae et al., 2005;\nAllison et al., 2007). The last stage (Phase III) is marked by\nthe crop ripening and consequent sucrose accumulation in the\nstalk organ. Low air temperatures, reduced precipitation, and\nlow-light photoperiod are important factors for the sugarcane\nripening (Inman-Bamber et al., 2002; Cardozo and Sentelhas,\n2013). At all sites, nutrients were accumulated in a linear\nfashion approach during Phase II as related to the potential\nyield production in each environment. However, in mid-point\nof Phase III, there was a decrease in the N and K content\nfor all components (stalks, tops, and dry leaves; **Figure 2** ).\nThus, we have two hypothesis for this nutrient changes close\nto physiological maturity (ripening): (1) nutrient remobilization\nfrom aboveground plant components to belowground organs,\nsuch as roots and rhizomes (Andersson et al., 2005; Lim et al.,\n2007); and (2) specific to N allocated in the tops and dry\nleaves, foliar emissions of ammonia via stomata can occur\nduring the leaf senescence, reducing the N content in plant\ntissues (Britto and Kronzucker, 2002; Epstein and Bloom,\n2005).\nDissection of plant components for studying biomass HI\nis critical for understanding efficiency and potential yield for\nsugarcane. Inman-Bamber et al. (2002) suggested that the\nbiomass HI (stalks to the aboveground biomass ratio) might\nbe variable due to the amounts of straw (dry leaves and tops)\nrecovered during the sampling procedure of sugarcane age field.\nIn this investigation, dry leaves and tops comprised sugarcane\nstraw, whereas tops are the plant component that accumulates\nthe greatest amounts of nutrients (\u223c60% N, \u223c75% P, and\n\u223c80% K) as compared to dry leaves ( **Figure 2** ; **Table 2** ).\nAccording to Trivelin et al. (2013), since dry leaves have low\nnutrient content, tops is a critical plant component that should\nremain as a crop residue to sustain long-term soil fertility.\nHowever, excessive stalk lodging in sugarcane fields (caused by\n\n\n\nhigh yields and winds) may lead to low return of the tops\nas straw component, since the whole plant is processed by\nthe harvester rather than prior cutting of tops and its direct\ndeposition on the ground. In this scenario, contribution of\nnutrients released from the straw for sugarcane nutrition can\nbe less significant. From the nutrient HI results ( **Table 2** ), the\nN replacement concept (Thorburn et al., 2011), based on the\nfertilizer N application to replace the N removed from the\nsystem (stalk harvested), is a promising way to recommend\nfertilizer needs for sugarcane not only for N, but also for\nP and K. This approach may deliver superior environmental\noutcome without reducing sugarcane yield. However, as HI\nwas not constant for any nutrient (ranging from 0.12 to 0.82,\nconsidering N, P, and K), future research on robust models\nfor optimizing the replacement concept is needed (Setiyono\net al., 2010). Low nutrient HIs for sugarcane should be\nconsidered as a better plant trait, in opposite to the biomass\npartitioning (HI), since more nutrients are retained in nonharvested plant components (straw) and then released to\nthe soil through leaching (for K) and mineralization (for N\nand P).\nNutrient-yield relationships for N and P presented a narrowed\nvariation for both stalks and aboveground plant relative to\nK variation on those plant organs ( **Figure 3** ). Potassium is\nthe most important nutrient in the osmoregulation process,\nwhich is important for cell extension and stomata movement\n(Shukla et al., 2009; Kingston, 2014). We can speculate that\nthe tops (functional leaves) have kept more balanced nutrient\nratios for metabolic functions (Groot et al., 2003; G\u00fcsewell,\n2004). Nutrient surplus (e.g., Site 1, with high K content in\nthe soil) can be storage in other component (stalk organ),\npresenting a low N:K ratio (0.09:1) than tops (functional\nleaves; **Supplementary Figure 1** ). In corn, Ciampitti and Vyn\n(2014) documented a more balanced N:P (5:1) and N:K\n(1:1) ratios under high-yielding environments. In a review\nanalysis, Sadras (2006) showed consistent N:P ratio differences\namong grain crops, 4:1 for oilseed, 6:1 for cereal, and 9:1\nfor legume. Similar N:P ratio, 5:1 units, was synthesized by\nCiampitti and Vyn (2014), in a historical and global analysis\nperformed for corn crop. On the opposite side, dry leaves (less\nfunctional tissues) presented the largest N:P ratio, 18:1 units\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 10 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\n\n(ranging from 6:1 to 51:1 units; **Figure 4D** ). Sugarcane yield\ninfluence was not clearly individualized for the N:P ratio of\ndry leaves, but lower nutrient content was observed in this\nplant component with a larger reduction on P (fivefold) in\nrelation to N (twofold) when compared with the tops organ\n( **Figures 4B,C** ). A higher N:P ratio in dry leaves is explained\nby the remobilization of nucleic-acid P to young leaves and\nthe lower P demand of mature tissues (Usuda, 1995; G\u00fcsewell,\n2004).\nA balanced nutrient approach is critical to sustain functional\ntissues and to promote C fixation, growth, and increase sugar\ncontent in the sugarcane production (Allison et al., 1997, 2007;\nZhao et al., 2014). From our study, nutrient content have a\nbroad range of variability related to stalk yield levels ( **Table 3** ).\nFor example, aboveground N, P, and K contents ranged from\n117\u2013280, 16\u201350, and 233\u2013560 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively, from low\n(\u226480 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ) and high yielding sites ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ),\nrespectively. Nutrient internal efficiencies can be described as\nthe ability of a plant to transform nutrients acquired from all\nsources (e.g., soil, fertilizer, and atmosphere) into economic yield\n(Cassman et al., 2002; Dobermann, 2007; Ciampitti and Vyn,\n2014), in this case represented as sugarcane yield. The higher\nvalues of NIE found in low-yielding environments represents\na dilution of that nutrient in the plant, and is related to its\ndeficiency. In contrast, low values of NIE observed in highyielding environments represent an accumulation of that nutrient\nin the plant, and two hypothesis may explain this pattern,\nas follows: to (1) a restriction in its internal utilization due\nto other limiting factors; and (2) an excessive uptake (also\ntermed as \u201cluxury consumption\u201d) of K, beyond the amount\nrequired for stalk production (Setiyono et al., 2010). Similar\nresults as obtained in this investigation were reported by\nSetiyono et al. (2010) and Ciampitti et al. (2013) for corn,\nwith lowest NIEs as the crop was reaching high-yield potential.\nThe RIE values reported here are ( **Table 3** ) similar but higher\nfrom those documented by Silva and Casagrande (1983) and\nGopalasundaram et al. (2012), which ranged from 0.56\u20131.20 kg\nN, 0.13\u20130.35 kg P, and 0.6\u20131.9 kg K per Mg of stalk produced.\nLower nutrient requirements presented in previous studies are\nassociated to low yield levels, coupled to interactions among\ngenotype, environment, and management (Dias et al., 1999;\nThorburn et al., 2011; Gopalasundaram et al., 2012). From the\nsoil perspective, nutrient availability can limit crop acquisition,\nthus leading to lower biomass and stalk production ( **Table 1**,\n**Figure 3** ). In high productivity systems, fertilization of N, P, and\nK is essential to replenish stalk nutrient removal in order to\nsustainably maintain high yield levels. Therefore, soil test remains\nas a powerful diagnostic tool to quantify nutrient availability\nand subsequent fertilizer needs (McCray et al., 2014). In Brazil,\nhowever, N recommendation for sugarcane is based on the target\nyield concept (Cantarella et al., 1998), where soil N supply, the\nmain source of N to the crop (Franco et al., 2011), is entirely\nneglected. Thus, a soil testing capable to predict _in situ_ N\nmineralization in sugarcane fields is critically needed.\nIn summary, nutrient ratios can provide useful information\nfor sugarcane growers as related to understanding crop nutrient\nbalances and improving fertility diagnosing systems. To extend\n\n\n\nof our knowledge, this study is the first one in synthesizing\ndata in nutrient ratios and yield potential for sugarcane crop.\nA main constraint on this analysis is related to when the data\nwas collected, all at harvest time, which it did not allow the\nutilization of this information for in-season fertility management.\nA temporal analysis on nutrient ratios involving multiple inseason sampling times is needed in order to provide timely\ninformation on nutrient management recommendations for\nsugarcane crop. Future research should be focus on connecting\nsoil and plant processes for identifying the main factors not only\naffecting nutrient ratios but also their relationship to the yield and\nplant biomass components.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nSeasonal biomass accumulation presented three growth\nphases (lag, exponential\u2013linear, and stationary) during the\nratoon growing season. In overall, improvement in stalk\nyields was tightly connected to superior aboveground biomass\naccumulation. Additionally, high yielding sugarcane was\ncorrelated with higher nutrient content, more balanced and\nnarrowed nutrient ratios, and higher efficiency in producing\neach unit of stalk per unit of nutrient accumulated. The nutrient\npartitioning evaluation portrayed lower nutrient (N, P, and K)\ncontent in the dry leaves fraction but with a high N:P ratio\nrelative to the top plant component. Greater sugarcane yield and\nnarrowed N:P ratio (6:1) were documented for tops fraction as N\nand P content increased.\nStalk yield gap can be closed by better balancing nutrient ratios\nthat can be achieved by better understanding complex plant-soil\npathways related to nutrient uptake and plant utilization. This\nsynthesis analysis not only provides a descriptive summary on\nthe variation of nutrient ratios at harvest at varying sugarcane\nyield levels, but also established a foundational concept on\ninvestigating nutrient ratios by dissecting plant components.\nFrom a pragmatic standpoint, further research is needed\nfor integrating the replacement concept in decision nutrient\nmanagement support tools for assisting sugarcane producers on\nthe farming decision-making process.\n\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: JL, IC, EM, MV-M,\nand PT.
