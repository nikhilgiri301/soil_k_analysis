A two-year field experiment was\nconducted with combined application of three N rates (135, 180, and 225 kg ha [-1],\ndenoted as N1-N3) and four K rates (0, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha [-1], denoted as K0-K3)\nusing super indica hybrid rice cultivar Yixiangyou (YXY) 2115 to explore the effects of\n\nco-application of N and K on rice growth and development. The results indicated\nthat the combined application of N and K had significantly interactive effects on dry\nmatter (DM) accumulation, nutrients absorption, N harvest index (NHI), K harvest\nindex (KHI), spikelets per panicle and most rice quality indexes. The highest total DM\naccumulation (17998.17-19432.47 kg ha [-1] ) at maturity stage was obtained under\n\nN3K2. The effect of co-application of N and K on nutrients absorption and\n\nutilization varied between the two years and within each year. The highest total\nN and K accumulations at maturity stage were observed under N3K1 and N3K2,\nrespectively, while the highest N recovery efficiency (NRE) and K recovery efficiency\n(KRE) were observed under N1K3. High expression levels of N and K metabolism\nrelated genes in rice grains were observed under N3K2 or N3K3, consistent with N\nand K uptake. Co-application of N and K increased rice yield significantly and the\nhighest yield (6745.02-7010.27 kg ha [-1] ) was obtained under N2K2. As more N was\n\ngradually applied, rice appearance quality improved but milling, cooking and eating\n\nquality decreased. Although appropriate application of K could improve rice milling,\n\ncooking and eating quality, it reduced appearance quality. The optimal\n\nmilling, cooking and eating quality were obtained under N1K2, while the best\nappearance quality was obtained under N3K0. Overall, a combination of 135-210 kg\nha [-1] N and 115-137 kg ha [-1] K application rates was recommended for achieving\n\nrelatively higher yield and better quality in rice production.\n\n\nKEYWORDS\n\n\nrice, combined application of nitrogen and potassium, nutrient absorption-utilization,\nyield, quality\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 01 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

Over half of China\u2019s population\nrelies on rice as their staple food. Consequently, the advancement of\nrice production holds paramount significance in meeting the living\nneeds of population and ensuring food security (Karthika et al.,\n2023). Nowadays, fertilizers have evolved into the principle source\nof soil nutrient provision. The enhancement of crop yield is\ninseparable from the application of chemical fertilizers, no\nexception for rice production. Approximately 30-50% of global\nincrease in crop yield can be attributed to fertilizer input (Erisman\net al., 2008), while the increase rate for rice yield can attain a notable\n57.4% (Wang et al., 2010a).\nN and K are essential nutrients for rice growth and\ndevelopment, and play important roles in the determination of\nboth yield and quality. The amount of N input in rice production in\nChina significantly surpasses the global average level (Ludemann\net al., 2022). However, there is a discernible decline in the utilization\n\nrate of N, possibly attributed to the persistent escalation of N\napplication rates (Ju et al., 2015). The application rate of N in rice\nproduction in southwest China reaches approximately 180 kg ha [-1],\nyet the absorption and utilization rate of N hovers between 32-37%\n(Zhang et al., 2015). However, due to the more apparent immediate\neffects of N fertilizer application, it is a prominent problem that the\npreference for higher N inputs over the combined application of N\nand K in Chinese rice production (Li, 2017). In contrast to N, the\napplication of K in rice production is often insufficient. Rice is a\ncrop that requires a high amount of K, with an uptake ranging from\n150-300 kg ha [-1] per season, comparable to or even exceeding the N\nuptake (Xu et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2019). Improper application of\nfertilizer will lead to the diminished nutrients utilization efficiency,\nyield reduction, deterioration of rice quality and environmental\npollution, which may have the potential to impact human living\ncondition and the sustainable development of agriculture and\necology (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Hence, the efficiency\nof fertilizer absorption and utilization after application, as well as\noptimization of fertilization methods, should be taken into\nconsideration to mitigate the adverse impacts associated\n\nwith fertilization.\n\nThe hybrid indica rice cultivar Yixiangyou 2115 is currently\nextensively cultivated in southwest China, acclaimed for its high\nquality, substantial yield and resistance to multiple stresses. It was\nidentified as \u201cSuper Rice\u201d in 2015 by the Ministry of Agriculture. So\nfar, it has been widely promoted and applied for more than 1.3\nmillion hectares and become a representative cultivar of hybrid rice\n\nin China. However, limited studies can be found on the cultivation\n\ntechniques aimed at achieving both high yield and high quality for\nthis specific rice cultivar. N and K have certain regulatory effects on\nrice growth and development. The rational application of N and K\ncan significantly enhance fertilizer utilization efficiency, thereby\npositively influencing both rice yield and quality. The phenomenon\nof heavy application of N with a comparably lighter application of K\n\n\n\nis common due to the relative lower cost of N fertilizer and the\n\nestablished fertilization habits, which leads to high yield but low\nefficiency in rice production. Numerous studies have explored the\nindividual effects of N or K on rice growth and development. A\ncomprehensive understanding of the combined effects of N and K\non nutrient absorption, utilization, as well as their impact on rice\nyield and quality, remains an area requiring further systematic\ninvestigation. Therefore, field experiments were conducted with\ncombined application of three N rates (135, 180, and 225 kg ha [-1] )\nand four K rates (0, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha [-1] ) using super indica\nhybrid rice cultivar YXY 2115 to explore the interactive effects of N\nand K on rice nutrients absorption and utilization, yield and quality.\nThe objective of this study was to clarify the optimal ration of N and\nK conducive to achieving both high yield and high quality for YXY\n2115. Also, the expression levels of N and K metabolism-related key\ngenes OsNRT1.1B, OsAMT2;1, OsNR2, OsHAK1, OsHAK5 and\nOsAKT1 were quantified to assess the molecular response of rice\ngrains to different fertilizer application rates. This study was\nexpected to provide a theoretical basis for the optimization and\nimprovement of cultivation methods to achieve high yield, high\nquality, and reduce fertilizer input for rice production in southwest\nChina, as well as the large-scale promotion and application of\n\nthis cultivar.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n\n2.1 Experimental site and materials\n\n\nField experiments were conducted during the growing seasons\nof 2019 and 2020 at the research farm of Sichuan Agricultural\nUniversity, Wenjiang city, Sichuan Province, China (30\u00b070\u2032 N, 103\u00b0\n83\u2032 E). The soil of the plot was clay soil. Prior to the establishment of\nthe field experiment, soil samples from the topsoil layer (0-0.20 m)\nwere analyzed. The climate data and analysis results of the top soil\nlayer were shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively. During rice\ngrowth period in two years, the daily average temperature and\n\nrainfall were 22.78 \u00b0C and 3.69 mm in 2019, and 23.31 \u00b0C and 6.53\n\nmm in 2020, respectively. Super indica hybrid rice cultivar\nYixiangyou 2115 (Sichuan Agricultural University), which is\nwidely cultivated in southwest China with high yield and quality\nwith the whole growth period of 146 days, was chosen and used as\n\nthe test material.\n\n\n2.2 Experimental design\n\n\nTwo factor factorial field trials with three levels of N and four\nlevels of K were conducted in two years, using a randomized\ncomplete block design with three replicates. Twelve treatments\nwere established by the complete combination of three N\napplication rates (135, 180 and 225 kg ha [-1], denoted as N1, N2\nand N3, respectively) and four K application rates (0, 90, 135 and\n180 kg ha [-1], denoted as K0, K1, K2 and K3, respectively). No\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 02 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

The area of each test plot was 5.0 m\u00d75.0 m, and\nthe transplant density was 30 cm\u00d725 cm (row spacing \u00d7 plant\nspacing) with one seedling per hill. Urea (N, 46.4%) was used as\nthe N source, superphosphate (P 2 O 5, 12.0%) was used as the\nphosphorus (P) source, and potassium chloride (K 2 O, 60.0%) was\nused as the K source. N fertilizer was used as basal manure and top\ndressing (twenty days after transplanting) at a 6:4 ratio. Basal N, P\n(90 kg ha [-1] ) and K were applied to the soil one day before\ntransplanting. For the fertilizer treatments, ridges with plastic\nfilm were used for separation, and protection lines were\n\nestablished between the treatment blocks to ensure the isolation\n\nof the experimental plots. During the whole growing season, rice\nwas continuously flooded with the river water. Field management,\nincluding the prevention and control of pests and weeds, was\nconducted according to the local cultural practices.\n\n\n2.3 Measurements and methods\n\n\n2.3.1 Dry matter accumulation\nTen representative hills were sampled from each plot based on\nthe average number of tillers at full heading stage (9 Aug 2019 and\n13 Aug 2020) and maturity stage (14 Sept 2019 and 15 Sept 2020),\nrespectively. Samples were then separated into different parts, and\nwere oven-dried at 105\u00b0C for 30 min and then to constant weight at\n\n\n\n80\u00b0C to determine the dry weight. DM of stem-sheath, leaf, panicle,\n\nand total biomass were recorded.\n\n\n2.3.2 Absorption and utilization efficiency of N\nand K\n\nAfter weighted, all dried samples were ground to make powder,\npassed through a 0.20 mm sieve, and digested with a mixture of\nconcentrated H 2 SO 4 and H 2 O 2 to determine N and K\n\nconcentrations. The N concentration was determined using a\ncontinuous flow analyzer (AA3, Seal Analytical Inc.,\nSouthampton, UK) while K was determined using flame\nphotometer (M-410, Sherwood Scientific Ltd., Cambridge, UK).\nThe nutrients absorption and utilization efficiency were analyzed as\nbelow (Wang et al., 2004, 2009).\n\n\nPlant N (K) accumulation amount (kg ha [\ufffd][1] )\n\n\n= Plant N (K) concentration \ufffd Plant DM weight\n\n\nTotal N (K) accumulation amount (kg ha [\ufffd][1] )\n\n\n= The sum of N (K) accumulations in the aboveground parts\n\n\n(stem \ufffd sheath; leaf and panicle)\n\n\nN (K) recovery efficiency (NRE and KRE, % )\n\n\n\nTotal plant N (K) accumulation amount of N (K) \ufffd fertilized plot\n\n=\n\n\ufffd Total plant N (K) accumulation amount of zero \ufffd N (K) plot !\n\n\n=Applied N (K) rate of fertilized plot \ufffd 100%\n\n\n\nTABLE 1 Soil properties of the top soil layer (0-0.20 m) at the experimental sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Years|pH|Organic<br>matter (g\u00b7kg-1)|Total N<br>content<br>(g\u00b7kg-1)|Total P<br>content<br>(g\u00b7kg-1)|Total K<br>content<br>(g\u00b7kg-1)|Available<br>N<br>(mg\u00b7kg-1)|Available<br>P<br>(mg\u00b7kg-1)|Available<br>K<br>(mg\u00b7kg-1)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2019|6.90|27.32|1.81|0.75|10.13|97.16|24.30|77.08|\n|2020|6.39|15.97|1.86|1.11|18.07|86.54|21.68|76.75|\n\n\nN, P, K represent nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, respectively.\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 03 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

The products\nwere quantified using a real-time PCR detection system, following\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions (SYBR Green Master Mix,\n\nVazyme). The rice Actin gene was used as an internal control.\nTreatment without nitrogen fertilizer was used as CK. The PCR\nprimers used were listed in Supplementary Table S5.\n\n\n2.3.4 Yield and yield components\nRice was harvested at maturity stage and the yield in each\nexperimental plot was recorded after measuring moisture content\nand removing impurities. Grain yield was adjusted to a moisture\ncontent of 13.5%. The number of effective tillers per hill was\ndetermined before harvest using 30 plants per plot. A total of 10\nselected plants were separated into single tillers according to the\nmarked date, and were used to measure 1000-grain weight, seedsetting rate, and filled grain number per panicle.\n\n\n2.3.5 Rice quality\nAt harvest, 10 plants from each plot were sampled randomly\nand allowed to dry naturally in the sun to assess rice milling quality,\nappearance quality, eating quality and rapid visco-analyzer (RVA)\nvalue after the material was stored at room temperature for\n\n3 months.\n\n\n2.3.5.1 Milling quality\nAbout 100.0 g rice grains were processed using a rice huller\n(JLG-2118, Taizhou Food Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) to\nobtain brown rice. The brown rice was polished using a rice milling\nmachine (JNMJ-3, Taizhou Food Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang,\nChina) to obtain milled rice. In order to obtain head rice, grain with\na length longer than 3/4 of its total length was separated from the\nmilled rice using a broken rice separator (FQS-13X20, Taizhou\nFood Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China). The brown rice, milled\n\n\n\nrice, and head rice are expressed as percentages of the total\ngrain weight.\n\n\n2.3.5.2 Appearance quality\nThe grain length, width, length/width, chalkiness rate and\nchalkiness degree were determined using a grain appearance\nanalyzer (JMWT12, Dongfu Jiuheng Instrument Technology Co.,\nLtd., Beijing, China).\n\n\n2.3.5.3 Rapid visco-analyzer value\nA 3.00 g sample and 25.0 mL of distilled water were added to a\ntest tube. Pasting properties were measured using an RVA device\n(3-D, Newport Scientific, Sydney, Australia) and analyzed with\nThermal Cycle for Windows software. Viscosity values were\nmeasured in a rapid viscosity analyzer unit (RVU).\n\n\n2.3.5.4 Eating quality\nThe sensory properties of the cooked rice were measured using\na rice sensory analyzer (STA 1B, Satake Asia Co., Ltd., Tokyo,\nJapan). Milled rice (30.00 g) was washed in a stainless-steel\n\ncontainer and then transferred into a 50 mL aluminum box\n\ncontaining 40 mL of water. The milled rice was cooked in a\nmultifunctional, timed food steamer (GF-339, Goodway Electrical\nEnterprise Ltd., Hong Kong, China). After the cooking, the sensory\nproperties of the cooked rice were determined. Cooked rice texture\nproperties were measured using a rice texture analyzer (RHS 1A,\nSatake Asia Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).\n\n\n2.4 Statistical analysis\n\n\nData were analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA),\nand means were compared based on the least significant difference\n(LSD) test at the 0.05 probability level by using SPSS 25.0 (Statistical\nProduct and Service Solutions Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The\nassumptions of variance analysis were tested by ensuring that the\nresiduals were random, homogenous, with a normal distribution\nabout/above a mean of zero (Ali et al., 2013; Abolfazl et al., 2017).\n\nOrigin Pro 2020 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) was used to\ndraw the figures. Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) was used\nto establish the binary quadratic fitting equation and figures.\n\n## 3 Results\n\n\n3.1 Dry matter accumulation\n\n\nDM accumulation in the aboveground organs of rice could be\nenhanced by increasing N application, and could be further\nincreased by applying appropriate K application at high N level\n(Figure 2). The maximum values of DM accumulation in stemsheath, leaf and panicle were observed under N3 at both full\nheading stage and maturity stage. Compared with other\n\ntreatments, the maximum increases of total DM accumulation\n\nwere obtained under N3K2, which were 57.54-66.62% at maturity\nstage. Variance analysis showed that co-application of N and K had\nextremely significant interactive effects on the DM accumulation in\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 04 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

The\nuptake of N and K could be further increased by applying\nappropriate K application, with a more obvious effect observed at\nhigh N level (Figures 3, 4). Co-application of N and K had extremely\nsignificant interactive effects on the uptake of N and K in the\naboveground organs of rice (Supplementary Table S2). The highest\nuptakes of N and K in stem-sheath, leaf and panicle were observed\nunder N3 at both full heading stage and maturity stage.\nAt maturity stage, the maximum increases were obtained under\nN3K1 (48.20%) in 2019 and N3K2 (91.29%) in 2020 for the total\n\nuptake of N, and under N3K2 (176.30%) in 2019 and N3K1\n(88.21%) in 2020 for the total uptake of K, respectively, when\ncompared with other treatments.\n\n\n3.3 Use efficiency of N and K\n\n\nNo obvious and consistent changes were observed in the\nresponse of N and K use efficiency indexes to the combined\n\n\n\napplication of N and K in two years test results. NRE decreased\nbut KHI increased with increasing N levels. Although the\napplication of K could increase NRE, NAE, NCR and KCR within\na certain range, it resulted in a decrease KAE (Tables 2, 3). Variance\nanalysis showed that co-application of N and K had extremely\nsignificant interactive effects only on recovery efficiency and harvest\n\nindex of N and K.\n\nCompared with other treatments, the maximum increases were\nobtained under N1K3 (193.30-236.86%) in both years for NRE, and\nunder N1K3 (442.90%) in 2019 and N3K1 (1664.63%) in 2020 for\n\nKRE. And the maximum increases were obtained under N3K1\n\n(19.44%) in 2019 and N3K3 (31.47%) in 2020 for NHI, and under\n\nN3K0 (171.06%) in 2019 and N3K1 (121.91%) in 2020 for KHI.\n\n\n3.4 Expression of N and K metabolismrelated genes\n\n\nSix genes were selected for analysis in response to the different\nfertilizer application rates in hybrid rice cultivar YXY 2115,\nconsidering their significant roles in N and K metabolism. The\n\nresults showed that OsNRT1.1B, OsNR2, OsHAK1, OsHAK5 and\n\nOsAKT1 had high expression level under high application rates of\nboth N and K except OsAMT2;1, which were consistent with the\nabove results of N and K uptake (Figure 5). The peak expression\n\nlevels of OsNRT1.1B and OsAMT2;1 were obtained under N3K1\n\n\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nEffects of combined application of N and K on dry matter accumulation of YXY 2115 at full heading stage (above) and maturity stage (below).

Meanwhile, OsHAK1 and OsAKT1\nachieved the highest expression levels under N3K3.\n\n\n3.5 Yield and yield components\n\n\nWith increasing N levels, grain yield (GY), panicle number\n(PN) and spikelet per panicle (SP) increased, while seed setting rate\n(SR) showed the opposite trend. No significant difference was found\nin 1000-grain weight (GW) among different treatments. The\ncombination of appropriate N levels with a high K level could\nfurther improve yield and yield components (Table 4). Variance\nanalysis showed that co-application of N and K had extremely\nsignificant interactive effects on SP. The highest GY, PN and SP\nwere observed under N3. Compared with other treatments, the\n\nmaximum increases of GY and SR were obtained under N2K2\n\n(3.27-5.61%) and N1K3 (16.32-20.53%), respectively. And the\nmaximum increases were obtained under N2K3 (117.97%) in\n\n2019 and N3K3 (39.06%) in 2020 for PN, and under N3K2\n\n(29.10%) in 2019 and N2K3 (30.78%) in 2020 for SP.\n\nRegression analysis of N and K application rates and yield was\ncarried out. By establishing a binary quadratic equation, the\nfertilizer response function equation between N and K application\n\n\n\nrates and yield was obtained.\n\n\nY 2019 = \u22120:0179N [2] +7:4833N\u22120:0112K [2] +3:0036K+0:0003NK+5944:5694\n\n\nY 2020 = \u22120:0159N [2] +7:3209N\u22120:0062K [2] +2:8293K\u22120:0067NK+5833:8396\n\n\nHere: Y represents the yield (kg ha [-1] ), N represents the nitrogen\napplication rate (kg ha [-1] ), K represents the potassium application\nrate (kg ha [-1] ).\nThe results showed that the relationship between N and K\napplication rates and yield could be described by binary quadratic\nequations, with each index exhibiting a maximum value (Figure 6).\nConsidering both economic benefits and yield, in conjunction with\nthe fertilizer response function equation, the optimal yield reached\n6936.58 kg ha [-1] in 2019. The recommended application rates for N\nand K were 210.18 kg ha [-1] and 136.90 kg ha [-1], respectively. In 2020,\nthe highest yield achieved was 6750.54 kg ha [-1] in 2020, with the\nsuggested application rates of N and K being 205.98 kg ha [-1] and\n115.02 kg ha [-1], respectively.\n\n\n3.6 Rice quality\n\n\nThe application of N could improve rice appearance quality, but\ndecreased milling quality, as well as cooking and eating quality.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nEffects of combined application of N and K on N uptake of YXY 2115 at full heading stage (above) and maturity stage (below).

Studies have reported that the\n\n\n\naccumulation of DM increased with increasing N levels (Sun,\n2019), and the N accumulation of rice all increased at each\n\ngrowth stage (Tang et al., 2019). The combined application of N\nand K could significantly alleviate the limitations to photosynthesis,\nespecially the biological constraints (Hou et al., 2018). In the present\nstudy, the DM accumulation of each vegetative organ in the\naboveground part of YXY 2115 increased with increasing N levels\nat both full heading stage and maturity stage. Notably, the uptakes\nof N and K in stem-sheaths and leaves decreased, while showing a\nsignificantly increase in panicles, in agreement with the previous\nstudies (Li et al., 2014; Yan, 2018; Jiang et al., 2020). Compared with\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 09 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

K0, K1, K2 and K3 refer to the different potassium\nfertilizer treatments (0, 90, 135 and 180 kg ha [-1], respectively). Different lowercase letters mean the significant difference between treatments levels at\np < 0.05. The data presented are the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, n = 3.\n\n\n\nN1, the total DM accumulation at maturity stage increased by\n14.79-18.64%%. As more N was gradually applied, the uptakes of N\nand K in stem-sheaths, leaves and panicles all increased. Compared\nwith N1, the total uptake of N and K under N3 at maturity stage\nincreased by 5.89-24.94%% and 17.68-40.99%, respectively. The\nenhancement of N and K uptake could be further optimized\nthrough the appropriate application of K, with a more\n\n\n\npronounced effect observed under high N levels. However, the\nDM accumulation showed a trend of first increasing and then\ndecreasing with increasing K under moderate and higher N levels,\nindicating that while appropriate application of K under high N\nlevels increased DM accumulation, excessively high N and K levels\nmay hinder this process.

Hence, correlation analysis was conducted on\nindexes that were relatively important in terms of rice nutrient\nabsorption and utilization, yield, and quality, as well as those\nexhibiting significant interactive effects when N and K were\napplied together. Correlation analysis showed that GY was\nsignificantly positively correlated with TDA, TNA and TKA at\nmaturity stage (Figure 7).

K has been observed to enhance the activities of\nnitrate reductase and aminotransferases, indicating a positive role of\nK in N metabolism (Ahanger et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016). In our\nstudy, as more N was gradually applied, NRE decreased and KHI\nincreased. Simultaneously, NRE, NAE, NCR and KCR increased,\nwhile KAE decreased with increasing K at the same N level. The\nobserved changes in nutrients use efficiency and yield aligned with\nthe principle of diminishing returns for fertilizer (Lu, 2003). Most\nresearchers addressed that the application of N within a certain\nrange could lead to a decrease in NRE, which was consistent with\nour results. However, variations in other indexes in the two-year\nfield experiments were either inconsistent or not conspicuous,\nwhich differed with the results of previous studies. This might be\n\n\n\nrelated to the unique characteristics of the YXY 2115 cultivar.

However, researches on the\nexpression of genes related to N and K metabolism are mainly\n\nfocused on rice roots, shoots, stems and leaves.\nPrevious studies have identified LOC_Os10g40600 as encoding\na nitrate transporter NRT1.1B which has been demonstrated to\nmediate nitrate signal transduction. In this study, the expression\nlevel of OsNRT1.1B in rice grains increased as more N was gradually\napplied, while the impact of K application rate on OsNRT1.1B\nexpression was limited (Figure 5A). These findings provided\nevidence that NRT1.1B expression was substantially induced by\nnitrate and was directly involved in nitrate uptake and nitrate\ntransport (Hu et al., 2015). Ammonium uptake from the soil\nsolution is mediated by ammonium transporters, such as the\nOsAMT2;1 gene, which encodes a functional ammonium\ntransporter and is a key gene in ammonium ion absorption\npathway. It has been reported that the expression level of\nOsAMT2;1 in rice cultivars with different N use efficiency varied\nunder different N application rates. High N use efficiency rice\ncultivar showed higher gene expression levels in leaves under low\nN application levels (Yang, 2021). However, no obviously changes\nwere observed in OsAMT2;1 expression level in rice grains under\ndifferent N and K application rates, except for N3K0, which requires\nfurther study (Figure 5B). Nitrate reductase (NR) is an important\nenzyme in plant N metabolism, playing a key role in N absorption\nand utilization. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two members of NR\ngene family in rice genome, NR1 and NR2, with over 70% similarity\nbetween their protein sequences (Zhao, 2010). During the grain\nfilling process, NR activity in leaves first increased and then\ndecreased. The activity of NR increased with increasing N levels\n\n\n\n(Lan, 2022). Consistent with this trend, the present study found that\nthe expression level of OsNR2 in rice grains increased with\nincreasing N levels, and could be further enhanced by applying\nappropriate K application at high N levels (Figure 5C).\nK plays irreplaceable roles in plant growth and development.\nThe KUP/HAK/KT family, with the largest family members and\ndiverse functions, is involved in nutrient metabolism, growth\nregulation and stress tolerance (Chai et al., 2019). Studies suggest\nthat OsHAK1, OsHAK5, and OsAKT1 are crucial for K [+] uptake at\nboth low and high concentrations, as well as for K [+] translocation\nfrom root to shoot. OsHAK1 and OsAKT1 exhibit high expression\nlevels in all cell types of roots and low levels in shoots (Manuel et al.,\n2016). Additionally, the transcription levels of HAK genes are\nregulated by the level of K nutrition. Overexpressing HAK1 or\nHAK5 in rice and maize increased K [+] uptake, thereby increasing\ngrain yield (Qin et al., 2019). In our studies, higher expression levels\nof OsHAK1, OsHAK5, and OsAKT1 in rice grains were observed\n\nunder N3K2 or N3K3, which were consistent with the above results\n\nof K uptake, indicating that a high N application level combined\nwith a high K application level was beneficial to K absorption in rice\n(Figures 5D\u2013F).\n\n\n4.3 Effects of co-application N and K on\nrice yield and quality\n\n\nDifferent N application patterns need to be combined with\nappropriate application of K to achieve optimal yields. Excessive\napplication of either N or K not only results in fertilizer waste and\nenvironment pollution but also decrease fertilizer use efficiency\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 13 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al. [10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744)\n\n\n\n(Wang et al., 2010b). Our results were corroborated with previous\nstudies indicating that rice yield exhibited an incremental trend\nwith increasing N application. However, beyond a certain threshold\nof N application, the yield increase became statistically insignificant\n(Hu et al., 2012). Over a two-year field experiment, our results\ndemonstrated that co-application of N and K yielded a higher rice\noutput compared to sole application of either N or K. These results\nindicated that appropriate combined application of N (180 kg ha [-1] )\nand K (135 kg ha [-1] ) could not only improve GY but also reduced the\nfertilizer input. However, an increase in K application did not\nexhibit a pronounced effect on the improvement of yield at the\nsame N level. Correlation analysis showed that GY was significantly\npositively correlated with PN and SP (Figure 7), indicating that the\nincrease of PN and SP might be the primary factors contributing to\nthe increased GY from N and K application (Yang and Zhang,\n2011). Furthermore, the positive impact of K application on rice\nyield components might be attributed to its promotion of root\ndevelopment, subsequently enhancing nutrient uptake by plants.\nDespite N application leading to a decrease in seed setting rate (SR),\nK application had a counteractive effect, compensating for the\noverall grain yield formation. The decrease in SR might be\n\nattributed to the substantial enhancement of PN and SP induced\n\nby N application, expanding the capacity of \u201csink\u201d rapidly.\nNevertheless, the grain filling process could not be carried out or\ncomplete timely due to the limited supply of \u201csource\u201d, which in turn\nled to the decrease in SR (Sun et al., 2012).\n\nIt is widely reported that reasonable application of N can reduce\nCR and CD of rice, thus improving the appearance quality of rice\n(Zhang, 2017). And the appropriate application of K under\nconditions that meet the N requirements for rice growth can\neffectively increase HR and reduce CR and CD, thereby\nenhancing both the milling quality and appearance quality of rice\n(Zhang et al., 2018). Besides, the contribution rate affecting rice\nquality tended to be in the order of N > K > P, with the interactive\neffect of N and K surpassing that of N and P (Xie et al., 2014). In the\npresent study, milling quality of YXY 2115 decreased with\nincreasing N levels. As more K was gradually applied at the same\nN level, both MR and HR first increased and then decreased. The\nabove results indicated that N and K mutually promoted each other,\nand their combined application was beneficial for improving the\nmilling quality of rice. The appearance quality of YXY 2115\nincreased with increasing N levels. However, as more K was\ngradually applied at the same N level, obvious increases in CR\n\nand CD were found. This result was not consistent with the\n\nprevious studies (Wang, 2015). The possible reason for this\ndifference could be the relatively high content of available K in\nthe experimental field soil, causing a decrease in the appearance\nquality of rice when additional K was applied. In general, higher\nfertilizer application tends to result in increased rice yield, but may\nreduce rice eating quality. Parts of rice quality indexes can be\nsignificantly enhanced within a certain level of K application (Ye,\n2021). Co-application of N and K can increase protein content of\nrice, thereby improve rice nutritional quality. However, the lack of\nK will lead to a decline in both the eating quality and nutritional\nvalue of rice (Zhang, 2017). In our study, the cooking and eating\nquality of YXY 2115 decreased with increasing N levels. As more K\n\n\n\nwas gradually applied at the same N level, the taste value,\nappearance and mouthfeel all first increased and then decreased,\nin agreement with the previous studies (Zhang and Qian, 2017). It is\nwidely recognized that rice cultivars with high eating quality\nnormally show higher peak viscosity and breakdown viscosity,\ncoupled with lower setback viscosity, as determined by the RVA.\nVariance analysis showed that co-application of N and K had\nsignificant interactive effects on PV, BV and SV. However, no\nsignificant differences or prominent impacts were found in the\nresponse of RVA profile characters to co-application of N and K\nover a two-year field experiment, indicating that the combined\napplication of N and K had limited effects on rice starch viscosity\n(Zhang, 2017). Taken together, in order to improve the appearance,\nmilling, and cooking and eating quality of rice, a reasonable\nnitrogen-potassium ratio becomes particularly important. The\noptimal milling, cooking and eating quality were obtained under\nN1K2, while the best appearance quality was obtained under N3K0.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\n\nReasonable combined application of N and K can mitigate\nfertilizer waste, reduce environmental pollution, lower production\ncosts and increase economic benefits by improving fertilizer use\nefficiency, rice yield and quality, thereby achieving the sustainable\ndevelopment of agriculture. The present study investigated the\neffects of co-application of N and K on rice yield, quality and\nnutrients absorption and utilization through a two-year field\nexperiment. The results revealed the feasibility of enhancing rice\nproduction efficiency and yield through co-application of N and K,\nwhich might provide an important reference for the large-scale\npromotion and application of Yixiangyou 2115. The highest rice\nyield was obtained under N2K2, while the optimal rice quality was\nobtained under N1K2. Thus, we recommended appropriate N\napplication levels ranging from 206 kg ha [-1] to 210 kg ha [-1],\ncombined with K application levels ranging from 115 kg ha [-1] to\n137 kg ha [-1] as a preferable approach to achieve high yield for super\nhybrid indica rice cultivar Yixiangyou 2115 in southwest China. A\ncombination of 135 kg ha [-1] N and 135 kg ha [-1] K application rates\nwas recommended for achieving better quality in rice production.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\nin the article/Supplementary Material.
