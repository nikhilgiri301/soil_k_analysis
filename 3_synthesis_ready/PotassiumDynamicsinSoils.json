It is a structural part of most of the soil minerals and its availability to\nplants is not directly proportional to the total amount of K in the soils. Potassium\navailability can be understood only by understanding the K content in soil, forms\nof K, soil mineralogy, and weathering status of the soils.\n\n\n2.1 Potassium Content in Soil\n\n\nCurrently, the world\u2019s most important potash deposits are located in (1) the Elk\nPoint, Maritimes, Paradox, and Salado Basins in North America; (2) the Zechstein,\nPripyat, Solikamsk, and Pricaspian Basins in Europe; (3) the Danakil and Lower\nCongo Basins in Africa; (4) the Dead Sea, Khorat, Sakon Nakon, Qaidam, and\nCentral Asia Basins in Asia; and (5) the Amazonas, Sergipe, and Neuqu\u00e9n Basins in\nSouth America (Fig. 2.1). Major potash producer countries are Canada, followed by\nRussian Federation, Belarus, Germany, Israel, Jordan, China, USA, Brazil, Chile,\nSpain, and UK (Jasinski 2011). In cultivated areas, K concentration may vary from\n0.01% to 4%, with an average calculated value of 1.36% (Jakovljevi\u0107 et al. 2003). In\nmineral soils, the average concentration of K is ~1.4%, with a broad range of 0.01%\nto 3.7%. The total soil K contents frequently exceed 20,000 mg kg [\ufffd][1] in most soils\n(Rehm and Schmitt 2002). In rocks and several soils, K is a major constituent of the\nprimary rock-forming minerals, for instance, alkali feldspar group, namely microcline and orthoclase. Mica group, specifically biotite and muscovite and secondary\nminerals such as illite are also a rich source of K (Jakovljevi\u0107 et al. 2003).\nThe concentration of soil available K varies with the degree of weathering and the\nsoil parent material which has direct impact on its supply (Table 2.1). In soils, K\nexists in four major forms, namely structural K, exchangeable (readily available),\nnon-exchangeable or fixed (slowly available), and readily available solution K\n\n\n\n# The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte\nLtd. 2022\n\nA.

In Sumner ME (ed), Handbook of soil\nscience. CRC Press, London, p B3\u2013B24\n\n\n\n(Rehm and Schmitt 2002). It has been revealed that more than 90% of soil K is\npresent in the form of primary minerals, while the amount of plant available K in the\nsoil solution is only about 0.2%, and it is the principle source of K for plant uptake\n(Fig. 2.3). The fixed form of K is called as structural, mineral, native, matrix or inert\nK. In many soils, the total K or the bulk of it is structural K is not directly available to\nplants. It has been found that nearby 90\u201398% K in the soil is in the unavailable form\ndepending on soil type. This K is released through the weathering process, nevertheless this process is so slow that it cannot meet crop requirements. However, fixed K\ncontents influence the concentration of soluble K in soil solution (Jakovljevi\u0107 et al.\n2003).\nThe second type of K present in the soil is the exchangeable K; which is present at\nthe exchange sites of various soil colloid complexes. This K is held by different bond\nstrengths at the non-specific adsorption sites. These sites may include the planer and\nedge positions of soil clay minerals or the negative charge sites which are developed\nby carboxylic and phenolic groups of humus colloids. The amount of K held at\nexchangeable sites of soil clay minerals depends upon the kinetic and thermodynamic factors (Parfitt 1992), for instance, the K concentration at exchangeable site in\nrelation to other exchangeable cation, and the nature of the soil surface. Approximately 90% of available K is present in exchangeable K, whereas the proportion of\nexchangeable to total K is <2%. It is stated that exchangeable K has a strong link\nwith CEC, pH, calcium carbonate, and organic carbon (Baruah et al. 1991). For\nexample, aridisols and inceptisols have comparatively higher K rich mica\n(Srinivasarao et al. 2007), and K present in illite have less mobility as these minerals\nhave narrow interlayer space which are K selective and ultimately decrease its\ndesorption (Sparks and Huang 1985; Sparks 1987). Furthermore, sub-surface soils\nhave less exchangeable K than surface soils and higher concentration of exchangeable K in the soil represent a good indication of ability of soil to supply K. Some\nexchangeable K may fix between layers of clay minerals and may be converted into\nslowly available K (Rehm and Schmitt 2002).\nThe third form of K is the non-exchangeable, fixed or slowly available, which is\ntrapped between the clay mineral layers, and plants cannot use this K fraction during\na single season. Nevertheless, this K can act as a reservoir for exchangeable K that is\nreadily available (Rehm and Schmitt 2002). This form of K is held between the\nadjacent tetrahedral layers of di- and tri-octahedral vermiculites and micas or\nbetween the chloritized vermiculite (Sparks and Huang 1985; Sparks 1987). The\nfixation of K takes place due to the increase in the number of binding forces between\n\n\n10 2 Potassium Dynamics in Soils\n\n\nK and clay surfaces than the hydration forces which are present between the\nindividual ions of K (Sparks 1987), making the release of K easy due to physical\ntrapping. The conversion of non-exchangeable K into the exchangeable K occurs\nwhen the solution K and exchangeable K level are decreased due to K removal by\ncrops, losses through leaching or through enhanced activates of soil microbes\n(Sparks 2000).\nThe non-exchangeable K is moderately to sparingly available to plants. The\nhigher concentration of non-exchangeable K is noticed in sub-surface soils than\nsurface soil. Furthermore, the soils enriched with illit clay minerals have high nonexchangeable K in the sub-surface because of the presence of clay and silt which\nhave ability to fix K (Sharma et al. 2009). This K fixation depends on the amount of\nK released from clay minerals, particle size, and their distribution/quantity and type\nof clay minerals, because these properties have strong correlation with clay and silt\nproportion of soil. The quantity of K fixed in soil and type of clay minerals rich in K\ncan influence the release of K to plants (Rao et al. 2001).\nThe fourth form of K is in the solution form which is readily available to plant.\nReadily available K may also be present at the exchangeable site of clay minerals\nwhich has been discussed earlier. The quantity of K in soil solution depends upon\nabsorption through the plants and also involves the soil minerals from which K is\nreleased. When the plants dissolve K present in soil solution, the concentration of K\nin soil solution drops, which is balanced after the release of K from exchangeable\nsites of clay minerals. This form of K mostly faces a leaching problem in soil. In the\nsoil solution, the amount of K is not constant and ranges from 3 to 30 mg kg [\ufffd][1] for\nnormal soils (Haby et al. 1990). The solution K level is mediated by kinetic\nreactions, soil moisture contents, and the equilibrium that occur between the forms\nof soil K, the concentrations of divalent cations in solution and on the exchanger\nphase (Sparks 2000). The amount of soil solution K is also affected by the buffering\ncapacity of soil clay minerals. For example, well-buffered vermiculates and micas\ncan hold the solution K level very firmly, while that of buffered allophonic clay\nmineral do not maintain the soil solution K level (Parfitt 1992). Additionally, slowly\navailable K, exchangeable K, and water-soluble K are interconvertible (Fig. 2.3),\nand this conversion is mediated by various factors, for instance, K supply, soil\nmoisture, soil temperature, and the removal of K via plant roots.\nThe removal of K by the plant is facilitated by K concentration in soil solution, K\navailability index, organic matter, clay minerology, cation exchange capacity, calcium carbonate, and other properties. The knowledge regarding the variation in K\nadsorption, differences among various soil types and the equilibration between K\nintensity and the phases of the quantity is valuable for precise and site-specific\npotash recommendation. Furthermore, the K contents in the soil may increase and\ndecrease depending on environmental and soil conditions. The indigenous soil K\ncontents are depleting with time owing to intensive cultivation of crops with less\npotash fertilization and other crop management practices, particularly the removal of\ncrop residues from the field.\n\n\n2.2 Soil Mineralogy and Potassium Dynamics 11\n\n\n2.2 Soil Mineralogy and Potassium Dynamics\n\n\nSoil clay mineralogy has great consequence in soil nutrient supplying capacity and\noverall nutritional status of a particular soil. It is exposed that the mineralogical\ncomposition of the soil may largely impact the K dynamics within the soil\n(Surapaneni et al. 2002), and this relationship between the K forms and clay\nmineralogy can be used to predict soil K fertility, and ultimately the potash fertilizer\nrecommendation. Clay mineralogy in the soil influences the fixed K which is not\nreadily available fraction of K in the soil. For instance, when the soil becomes dry,\nmontmorillonite clays fix K because K is trapped in clay mineral layers. When the\nsoil becomes wet, this trapped K release. In contrast, illite dominant soils, the K is\nfixed between the layers of clay minerals when the soil is dry, but releases only small\namount of K when soil becomes wet. Furthermore, clay minerals such as smectite\nand kaolinite easily release all of their adsorbed K than do illite and vermiculite\n(Mengel and Uhlenbecker 1993). Therefore, the age of soil developed from these\nclay minerals determines the extent of weathering are responsible to regulate the soil\nK dynamics (Fig. 2.2).\nThe major share of K exists in micas and feldspars clay minerals which contain\n6\u20139% and 3.5\u201312% of the total soil K and such 2:1 type of clay mineral revealed as\nmajor sources of non-exchangeable K (Moritsuka et al. 2004). However, the plants\nare unable to use this crystalline-insoluble K present in these minerals. Weathering\nof these rocks result in the release of K; some of this K moves towards the readily\navailable pool and some towards slowly available pool. Thus, this K fixation in illite\nclays without release causes serious problems for management of potash fertilizer for\ncrop production (Rehm and Schmitt 2002). The other clay minerals which bear K are\nprimary aluminosilicates such as micas-muscovite, biotite and secondary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10% K (fixed) 6-8% K 4-6% K approx. 3% K <1% K\n\n\nCEC (0 meq/100g soil) CEC (30-50 meq/100g soil) CEC (140-160 meq/100g soil)\n\n\nAs a result of weathering process soil hydration, specific surface area, and CEC are increasing\nwith reducing particle size, meanwhile indigenous soil K contents are decreasing\n\n\nFig. 2.2 Schematic diagram of the soil weathering process in relation to potash availability.

The formation of these phyllosilicates\noccurs through the weathering of primary minerals or from the secondary silicates\nafter adequate rainfall (Essington 2004). The K availability to plants is very easy\nfrom phyllosilicates and its associated clay minerals. A majority of clay particles in\nsoil have particle size of <0.002 mm, and are made from the secondary clay\nminerals.\nThe exchangeable K may bind on non-specific adsorption sites of clay minerals,\nat the carboxylic and phenolic groups of soil and also on soil organic matter. The\nabsorption of the K [+] takes place non-specifically in hydrated form. These\nnon-specific adsorption sites are present on the edge \u201ce\u201d and planar \u201cp\u201d position of\nclay minerals, and aluminum hydroxides and amorphous iron (Sparks 2003). The\nlattice or structural K is covalently bonded with the crystalline structure of K\nenriched primary silicate minerals such as feldspars, namely microcline, orthoclase\nshowing framework structure and micas, namely muscovite biotite showing layered\nstructure. The micas consist of ~8% of soil K. These types of clay minerals are\npresent in the coarser fractions of soils (e.g. sand and silt) and the contained K in\nthese minerals is release through the long-term weathering process. However, this K\nis not practically available to plants. The typical process of weathering proceeds in\nfollowing order: (1) muscovite, (2) hydro muscovite, (3) illite, (4) mixed clay\nminerals, e.g. kaolinite-illit or illit-montmorillonite (Fig. 2.2). In this weathering\nprocess, the K ion is substituted by hydroksyanion H 3 O [+], and thus the next product\ncontains less K (Pracz 2003).\nAlthough K is found in large quantities in world soil, the immediate plant\navailable K is non-sufficient to meet the requirement of a specific crop. Beside\nthis, the added K fertilizer may adsorb on soil colloids, may fix in clay minerals, or\ncan leach to the underground water, especially in sandy soils. It has been found that\n~57% of the applied K can be adsorbed by soil colloid depending on the type and\namount of soil clay minerals (Pal et al. 1999), for example, illite and vermiculite\nhave higher K adsorption specificity. In contrast, some studies have quantified that\nthe rate of K adsorption on illite and vermiculite clay minerals is slower than that\nrecorded on kaolinite and montmorillonite. The particle size and chemical composition of the clay minerals affects considerably the release of K from clay minerals\n(Huang 2005) (Table 2.2). Furthermore, the fixation process of K is relatively fast,\nwhereas the release of fixed K is very slow due to the strong binding force between K\n\n\n2.3 Nature of Minerals in Pakistani Soils 13\n\n\nand clay minerals (\u00d6born et al. 2005). Whether a soil fixes or releases K highly\ndepends on the K concentration in the soil solution (Schneider et al. 2013).\n\n\n2.3 Nature of Minerals in Pakistani Soils\n\n\nThe soils of Pakistan are composed of the various types of clay minerals such as\nmuscovite, biotite, mica, smectite and vermiculite, feldspar, quarts, chlorite, montmorillonite, kaolinite, and illite. Among these clay minerals, both mica and illite are\ndominent in the soils of Pakistan, and it determines the chemistry of soil solution,\nand thus the fertilizer behavior (Fig. 2.3). The silt and sand fractions of these soils\nconsist of primary clay minerals such as mica, feldspar, and quarts; mica and\nfeldspar present in large fractions and are ores of K. The clay fractions consist of\nsecondary clay minerals, namely vermiculite, chlorite, montmorillonite, kaolinite,\nillite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite being most abundant. Although the soils of\nPakistan also have chlorite and kaolinite clay minerals which contain K, but their\nsignificance as potash nutrition is low due to their low nutrient retention ability.\nIndeed, the poor drainage and semi-arid environmental conditions may cause the\nfurther weathering of these both clay minerals to saponitic smectites.\nThe alluvial soils of Pakistan have both clay minerals, namely mica and illite;\ncrucial source of K nutrient. Mica is most dominate K bearing clay mineral in\nPakistan which is formed by slow weathering of Himalayan rocks. The K contents\nof mica in clay, silt, and sand are 97%, 93%, and 70%, respectively (Ali et al. 2006).\nDuring weathering, mica releases the K ions into soil solution. If the process of\nweathering proceeds enough, mica is converted into expandable illite, also known as\nhydrated mica, after the entry of water in interlayer. The hydrous mica in Pakistani\nsoils is of two types namely biotite mica and muscovite. Among both these types, the\nbiotite mica is more important form fertility point of view as it releases the K,\n100 times more than muscovite in soil solution (Ali et al. 2006).\nLike other clay minerals, smectite and vermiculite are found in very low quantity\nin most of the soils in Pakistan, but these clay minerals play a crucial role in the\nfixation and release of K fertilizers due to their shrinking and swelling properties and\nhigher nutrient exchange capacity. The formation of vermiculite clay minerals takes\nplace after intensive weathering of illite, accomplished with the release of K. In soils,\nwhere the vermiculite is a dominant clay mineral, the phenomenon of fixation may\noccur due to high nutrient exchange capacity and high adsorption selectivity of\nvermiculites for ammonium and K than other nutrients, which may reduce the\nfertilizer use efficiency. However, the vermiculite clay minerals are rarely developed\nin the Pakistani soil except in Murree, Wazirabad, Gujranwala, and Satgarh soil\nseries (Ali et al. 2006).\nIn Pakistani soils, the smectite clay mineral can be divided into beidellite and\nmontmorillonite. Under wet conditions, both of these clay minerals expand, while\nboth shrink on drying. Regarding the K fixation, the behavior of beidellite clay\nmineral is similar to vermiculite, while the K fixation capacity of montmorillonite is\n50 times less than beidellite. Thus, in Pakistani soils, the occurrence of beidellite and\n\n\n14 2 Potassium Dynamics in Soils\n\n\n2.4 Plant Available Potassium 15\n\n\nvermiculite is highly related to K deficiency, while the occurrence of illite and\nmontmorillonite to optimum K supply status. A soil can be regarded as best which\ncontain montmorillonite and both illite/mica, because the K released from both these\nclay minerals can be held as an exchangeable nutrient by montmorillonite clay\nmineral with less fixation but more easy availability to crop roots (Ali et al. 2006).\n\n\n2.4 Plant Available Potassium\n\n\nThe amount of K present in the soil is evaluated by a number of soil factors such as\nits uptake by plant, degree of weathering such as the amount and type of clay, the\naddition of fertilizer, leaching losses, and the fixation process/K release that occur in\nthe soil. As mentioned earlier, the plants are unable to take up most of the soil\nindigenous K because it is present in structural or fixed form. Plants can take up only\nthose fractions of the K which are present in the dissolved form (<100 mg kg [\ufffd][1] ) or\nexchangeable form (Rehm and Schmitt 2002). Furthermore, the supply of K to plant\nis directly controlled by the K concentration in soil solution. Additionally, some soils\nwith low plant available K can maintain the high levels of solution K which fulfill the\ncrop requirements and hence the outer K input did not impact crop growth as the\nneeds are fulfilled by K already in soil.\nIn Pakistan, K content in soils has traditionally been considered adequate for\nnormal plant growth as they are developed from mica type of clay minerals; but in\nmost soils, most of this K is not necessarily available to plants to complete their life\ncycle. In such soils, K is bound to the clay mineral which do not release the K at the\nrates which are required for optimum crop harvest. In an early study, it was reported\nthat most of soils in Pakistan have less than 150 mg kg [\ufffd][1] of exchangeable K (Bajwa\nand Rehman 1996), and it is considered deficient to fulfill the requirements of most\nof the crops. Furthermore, the extensive cropping with high yielding cultivars\naccomplished with no potash fertilizer in Pakistani soils have seriously dropped\nsoil indigenous K level. More than 30% of soils in Pakistan require potash fertilizer\nbecause these soils are K deficient (Akhtar and Dixon 2009). However, the application rate is also very low and according to the most recent report only 16% farmers in\ncotton growing areas of Pakistan use potash containing fertilizers while 44% soils\nare revealed K deficient (Wakeel and Ishfaq 2016).\nIn intention to assess the changing pattern of soil K levels in Pakistan, data from\nsoil samples analyzed for advisory purpose to farmers from two particular years,\nnamely 1990 and 2005 were compared (Table 2.3). The Punjab province of Pakistan\nwas categorized into four agroecological zones, namely Rainfed Zone comprises of\nnorthern parts of the province; Rice Zone consists of irrigated north-eastern parts of\nthe province; Central Zone comprises of central irrigated districts of the province and\ncotton Zone falls in southern parts of the province. It was observed that within\n\n\u2013\n15 years; soil available K declined 7 49% in different agroecological zones of\nPunjab province. Such dramatic depletion of K is alarming, and soils are prone to\nadditional K deficiency if potash fertilizers will not be oriented in farmer input\npractices.\n\n\n16 2 Potassium Dynamics in Soils\n\n\nTable 2.3 Soil potassium level (mg kg [\ufffd][1] ) in various crop zones of Punjab\u2013Pakistan by 1990 to\n2005 (analyzed by Soil Fertility Research Institute, Punjab)\n\n|Zone|1990|Col3|2005|Col5|Percent decrease|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Zone|No. of samples|Mean value|No. of samples|Mean value|Mean value|\n|Rainfed|1500|114|1550|106|7|\n|Rice|1400|176|1645|132|33|\n|Central|2670|295|3200|198|49|\n|Cotton|1658|210|2280|165|27|\n\n\n\nSource: Ahmad and Mian (2009)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAhmad Z, Mian SM (2009) Increasing crop productivity through judicious use of potash in\nPakistan.
