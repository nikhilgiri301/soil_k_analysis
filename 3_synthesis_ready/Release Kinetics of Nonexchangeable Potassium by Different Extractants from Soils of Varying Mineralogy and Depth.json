The cumulative release of nonexchangeable\nK was greater in smectitic soils (353 mg K kg [2][1] at 0- to 15-cm depth and\n296 mg K kg [2][1] at 15- to 30-cm depth, averaged for 2 soils and 3 extractants) than in\nillitic (151 mg K kg [2][1] at 0- to 15-cm depth and 112 mg K kg [2][1] at 15- to 30-cm\ndepth) and kaolinitic (194 mg K kg [2][1] at 0- to 15-cm depth and 167 mg K kg [2][1] at 15to 30-cm depth) soils. Surface soils exhibited larger cumulative K release in\nsmectitic and illitic soils, whereas subsurface soils had larger K release in kaolinitic\n\n\nReceived 24 September 2004, Accepted 2 September 2005\nAddress correspondence to Ch.

The efficiency of citric\nacid extractant was greater in illitic soils than in smectitic and kaolinitic soils.\nRelease kinetics of nonexchangeable K conformed fairly well to parabolic and firstorder kinetic models. The curve pattern of parabolic diffusion model suggested\ndiffusion controlled kinetics in all the soils, with a characteristic initial fast rate up\nto 7 h followed by a slower rate. Greater nonexchangeable K release rates in\nsmectitic soils, calculated from the first-order equation (b \u00bc 91.13 \ufffd 10 [2][4] h [2][1] ),\nsuggested that the layer edge and wedge zones and swelling nature of clay facilitated\nthe easier exchange. In contrast to smectitic soils, higher release rate constants obtained\nfrom parabolic diffusion equation (b \u00bc 39.23 \ufffd 10 [2][3] h [2][1] ) in illitic soils revealed that\nthe low amount of exchangeable K on clay surface and larger amount of interlayer K\nallowed greater diffusion gradients, thus justifying the better fit of first-order kinetic\nequation in smectitic soils and parabolic diffusion equation in illitic soils.\n\n\nKeywords: Nonexchangeable K release, extractants, mineralogy, first order, soil depth\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nIt has been well established that a significant proportion of plant needs of\npotassium (K) are met from nonexchangeable fraction of soil K (Mengel\n1985; Srinivasarao et al. 1999, 2000). Under intensive cropping, in the\nabsence of K fertilization, initially exchangeable K in soil contributes to\nplant K nutrition, but with further cropping, exchangeable K attains a\ncertain minimal level; afterward, plant K removal from soil and contribution\nof nonexchangeable K to K uptake are almost synonymous and accounts for\nup to 90\u201395% of the total plant K uptake (Srinivasarao and Khera 1994).\nBecause of the larger contribution of nonexchangeable K to plant K needs,\nlack of crop responses to applied K have been reported even in soils with\nlow exchangeable K (Mengel and Uhlenbecker 1993). The major sources of\nnonexchangeable K in soils are K-rich 2 : 1 clay minerals such as micas and\nvermiculite (Sparks et al. 1987; Moritsuka et al. 2004). However, the\nrelease of K from the interlayer of these minerals may be very slow,\ndepending on the weathering stage of these minerals; therefore, whether the\nK release rates of soils under cropping are in tune with plant K needs\nbecomes the most important aspect as far as K nutrition of crop plants is\nconcerned.\n\nNonexchangeable K in soil is extracted by using several extractants such\nas dilute salt solutions (Lopez-Pineiro and Garcia-Navarro 1997), cation\nexchange resins (Martin and Sparks 1983), organic acids (Song and Huang\n1988), sodium tetraphenyl boran (Cox and Joern 1997), nitric acid (GilSotres and Rubio 1992). Electroultrafiltration (EUF) is also used (Rubio and\nGil-Sotres 1996). Several kinetic equations have been used to study the\nrelease of nonexchangeable K. These include first-order (Srinivasarao et al.\n1998), parabolic diffusion (Sharma and Swami 2000), zero-order\n\n\nRelease Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 475\n\n\n(Srinivasarao et al. 1998) and Elovich equation (Martin and Sparks 1983).\nHowever, different models have been found to fare better in explaining K\nrelease from soil particles or whole soils under particular condition because\nof the differences in release mechanisms (Carey and Metherell 2003). The performance of a particular model may be varying in relation to soil K status\n(Elkhatib and Hern 1988), K-depleted/undepleted soils (Srinivasarao et al.\n1998), extraction media (Sharma and Swami 2000), and stage of extraction\n(early/later) (Burns and Barber 1961). Better performance of parabolic\ndiffusion equation for light textured Chomu and Pali series compared with\nheavy textured Chambal series of India was reported by Sharma and Swami\n(2000) in explaining K release in CaCl 2 solution. Better performance of\nfirst-order equation for smectitic black soils was also reported earlier by\nDhillon et al. (1989) in CaCl 2 medium over illitic alluvial and kaolinitic red\nsoils. Nonexchangeable K release confirmed to first-order kinetics better in\nK-rich clay soils in 0.01 M CaCl 2 medium compared with light textured\nsoils (Sharma and Swami 2000).\nAlthough a major portion of plant nutrients is absorbed by crop plants\nfrom the surface soil, subsoil contribution to nutrition is often substantial\n(Beringer 1985). A great majority of studies on K in soils have been solely\nconcerned with samples collected from the surface soils (0\u201315 cm).\nDifferent forms of K in subsoil (15\u201330 cm) were evaluated in relation to\nthose in surface soil (0\u201315 cm) in 22 benchmark soil series of India, which\nindicated that subsoil K contribution was up to 96% of the surface soils\n(Srinivasarao et al. 2001). The present study examines the nonexchangeable\nK release from different benchmark soils of India representing a wide area\nvarying in their mineralogy and K status. Nonexchangeable K release from\nsubsoils is important because many crops can obtain substantial amounts of\nK from lower layers especially in deep rooted crops. Therefore, the objectives\nof present study are 1) to evaluate the nonexchangeable K release from\nimportant benchmark soils varying in mineralogy, K status, and also in\nrelation to soil depth and extraction media; 2) to evaluate different mathematical models for describing nonexchangeable K release and to find\nwhether their performance varies with mineralogical composition of soils,\nsoil K status, and extraction media; and 3) to examine the relationship of K\nrelease rates obtained in the kinetic studies with conventional soil test\n\nmeasures of K.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nSoil Analysis\n\n\nPhysicochemical and mineralogical properties of six benchmark surface\n(0\u201315 cm) and sub-surface (15\u201330 cm) soils that occur widely in intensively\ncultivated regions in six states of India sampled by Potash Research Institute\n\n\n476 Ch. Srinivasarao et al.\n\n\nof India, Gurgaon, were used in the present study. Details on soil series, location,\ntaxonomic classification, selected soil properties, and soil test K are given in\nTable 1. Soil pH was measured in a 1 : 2.5 (w/v) soil to water mixture by\nusing a glass pH electrode (Elico pH analyzer model LI-612). Organic carbon\n(organic C) was determined by the wet oxidation method of Walkley and\nBlack (1934), and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) was estimated by using the\nmethod of Bundy and Bremner (1972). Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of\nthe soils was determined by the sodium acetate (NaC 2 H 3 O 2 ) method\n(Richards 1954). Different extractable forms of K [e.g., water-soluble\n(Jackson 1973), 1 N NH 4 OAc (Hanway and Heidel 1952), and sodium tetraphenyl boron (NaTPB) (Schulte and Corey, 1965)] were determined.\n\n\nMineralogical Analysis\n\n\nThe mineralogical composition of silt and clay fractions is given in Table 2.\nFor mineralogical analysis, the soils were dispersed in 1% sodium hexametaphosphate with vigorous shaking (Sidhu and Gikes 1977). The sand\nfraction (0.05\u20132 mm) was separated by wet-sieving, and the silt fraction\n(0.002\u20130.05 mm) was separated by sedimentation. The clay (,0.002 mm)\nsuspension was siphoned off after requisite settling time (Jackson 1973).\nThe silt and clay samples were flocculated with excess KCl and MgCl 2 . The\nMg-saturated silt and clay samples were X-rayed, glycolated, and X-rayed\nagain with a Philips diffractometer. Potassium-saturated silt and clay\nsamples were X-rayed after drying for 1 h and again after heating to 5008C\nfor 1 h. Based on the peak area of different reflections, a semiquantitative\nanalysis of different minerals in the silt and clay fractions was undertaken\nby following the procedure of Klages and Hopper (1982).\nKamliakheri and Noyyal soil series belong to Vertisol and Vertic\nsubgroups, are alkaline in pH, calcareous in nature, fine textured, and are\nsmectite dominant soils. Lukhi and Rarha series belong to Inceptisols with\nillite as dominant clay mineral. Kodad and Vijayapura series belong to\nAlfisols and are kaolinite dominant. Soils of Vijayapura series had a considerable amount of amorphous materials, which are mainly hydrous oxides of iron\n(Fe), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and hydrated silico-aluminas. In each\ngroup, two series with wide variation in soil test nonexchangeable K were\nincluded in this study to understand the differences in K chemistry of soils\nwith similar mineralogical composition.\n\n\nNonexchangeable Potassium Release Kinetics\n\n\nNative exchangeable K was removed from surface and subsurface soils before\ninitiating the kinetic studies (Martin and Sparks 1983). For this, soil samples\nwere calcium (Ca) saturated by equilibrating 5 g soil with 0.25 M CaCl 2 three\n\n\nTable 1. Soil properties, mineralogy, and K status\n\n\npH w Org.

One gram each of Ca-saturated\nsoils, in duplicate, suspended in 20mL of 0.01 M CaCl 2, 0.01 M citric acid,\nand 0.01 M HCl media were equilibrated at 258C for 1, 7, 19, 43, 67, 95,\n115, 139, 163, 187, 211, 235, 259, 283, 307, 331, 355, 379, 403, and 427 h\nby shaking for 1 h before the suspensions were centrifuged for 10min at\n10,000 \ufffd g. The supernatant liquid was measured for K by flame photometer\n(Elico Model CL-360).\nNonexchangeable K released with time was fitted by using the different\nequations (Martin and Sparks 1983).\n\n\nFirst-order reaction: ln\u00f0K 0 \ufffd K t \u00de \u00bc a \ufffd bt\nParabolic diffusion: K t =K 0 \u00bc a \u00fe bt [1][=][2]\n\nZero-order reaction: \u00f0K 0 \ufffd K t \u00de \u00bc a \ufffd bt\nElovich equation: K t \u00bc a \u00fe b lnt\n\n\nwhere K t is the cumulative K released (mg/kg) at time t (hours), K 0 is the\nmaximum cumulative K released (mg/kg), and a and b are constants. Four\nmodels were tested by the least-square regression analysis to determine\nwhich equation described better the nonexchangeable K release from the\nsoils. Standard error of the estimate (SE) was calculated by\nSE \u00bc [(q 2 q [\ufffd] ) [2] /n 2 2)] [1][/][2], where q and q [\ufffd] represent the measured and calculated amounts of nonexchangeable K in soil at time t, respectively, and n is the\nnumber of data points evaluated. The rate constants of K release from soils in\ndifferent media of extraction were calculated on the basis of these models.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nNonexchangeable Potassium Release\n\n\nThe pattern of successive extraction of nonexchangeable K from soils\nbelonging to three mineralogically different soil series (i.e., smectitic\nNoyyal, illitic Rarha, and kaolinitic Vijayapura in different media of extraction] is presented in Figure 1. The amounts of K released during 427 h of\nextraction period was generally higher in smectite dominant soils followed\nby illite and kaolinite dominant soils (Table 3). However, there were deviations in the nonexchangeable K release in the citric acid medium where\nillitic Lukhi series (0\u201315 cm) and kaolinitic Kodad series (15\u201330 cm)\nshowed larger K release than smectitic Kamliakheri series. The amount of\nK extracted was greater in the first 3\u20134 extractions, decreased in later extractions, and then remained nearly constant after 10\u201311 extractions (Carey and\nMetherell 2003; Pannu et al. 2003). Within each group, there was a wide\nvariation in the cumulative K release between soils (Table 2). Kamliakheri\n\n\n480 Ch. Srinivasarao et al.\n\n\nFigure 1.

The difference\nbetween nonexchangeable K release between two series could be due to\nvariation in clay mineral composition in silt and clay fractions of soil\n(Table 2).

Srinivasarao et al.\n\n\ndominant minerals in clay fraction and in silt fraction, feldspars \u00fe quartz was\nthe dominant mineral. In Noyyal soil series, smectite and illite were the\ndominant mineral followed by feldspars \u00fe quartz, and kaolinite in clay\nfraction, and feldspars \u00fe quartz and illite in silt fraction. Presence of considerable amounts of K-rich minerals, such as illite in silt and clay fractions of soils\nwith fine texture, could result in larger K release as in Noyyal series.\nLukhi and Rarha series belonging to Inceptisols showed considerable\ndifferences in nonexchangeable K release. Rarha series showed higher K\nrelease than Lukhi series, irrespective of soil depth and extraction medium.\nIn both cases, illite was the dominant mineral followed by chlorite, vermiculite, feldspars \u00fe quartz, and kaolinite in clay fraction. Illite was dominant in\nsilt fraction of both Rarha and Lukhi series. Similarly, in kaolinitic soils, considerable quantities of illite in silt and clay fractions of Kodad series resulted\nin larger K release than Vijayapura series. Thus, fine texture, together with\nillite/mica dominance in silt and clay factions of soils, are major factors for\nlarger nonexchangeable K release in soils. Several authors reported earlier\nthat soils of fine texture showed larger K release than coarse textured soils\n(Martin and Sparks 1983). On the basis of relationships established between\nK replenishment rates of soils and amount and nature of clay minerals in\nillitic alluvial soils (Srinivasarao and Khera 1994) and smectitic Vertisols\n(Srinivasarao et al. 1998) it was stated that the release of K from nonexchangeable source depends mainly on the composition of clay minerals in soils.\nAlthough soils having high clay are generally associated with high reserves\nof soil K, it is not essentially true for all the soils.\nSurface soils (0\u201315 cm) showed larger cumulative K release in smectitic\nand illitic soils than subsurface (15\u201330 cm) soils, irrespective of the medium\nof extraction. In kaolinitic soils, surface soils showed either the same or lower\n\nK release than subsurface soils. This result could be due to downward\n\nmovement of finer particles with leaching during rainy seasons. Therefore,\nsubsoil K plays an important role in Alfisols soils, which are generally low\nin K because of lower levels of K-bearing minerals. Evaluating the subsoil\nK availability of 22 benchmark soil series of India, Srinivasarao et al.\n(2001) reported that light textured red and lateritic and acidic alluvial soils\nhad larger K availability in subsurface soils than surface soils.\nCumulative K release varied significantly among the media of extraction.\nIn all the soils, larger amount of K was extracted in 0.01 M citric acid followed\nby 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M HCl. The differences in K release among the\nextraction media could be attributed to differences in their nature of reaction\n\nin soil. Larger amount of K released in citric acid is due to the dissociated\nH [\u00fe] ions and complexing organic ligands in the organic acid medium. The\nlow molecular weight organic acids with OH and COOH groups in the orthoposition tend to form metal-organic complexes in solution with some metal\nions from mineral structures (Kononova et al. 1964), thus accelerating the\nmineral decomposition. Although the HCl medium also possesses proton\nsource, the mechanism is restricted only to exchange of H [\u00fe] ions with K [\u00fe]\n\n\nRelease Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 483\n\n\nions of minerals. Once exchange positions are filled with H [\u00fe], further exchange\nfrom highly selective sites of minerals is difficult with dilute acid solutions. In\n0.01 M CaCl 2, the K [\u00fe] ions on the surface of mineral structure are exchanged by\nCa [2][\u00fe] in the CaCl 2 solution. Because of larger size of Ca [2][\u00fe] ions and hydration\nenergy (Rich 1968), it does not exchange easily with K further in the interlayer.\nThe efficiency of citric acid medium was greater than CaCl 2 solution in\nillitic soils than in smectitic and kaolinitic soils. The increase in extracted K\nwas 20 (68 mg/kg) to 43% (114 mg/kg) in smectitic soils, 85 (104 mg/kg)\nto 81% (74 mg/kg) in illitic soils, and 19 (16 mg/kg) to 50% (41 mg/kg) in\nkaolinitic soils, respectively.\n\n\nMathematical Models\n\n\nDifferent mathematical models (e.g., first-order, parabolic diffusion equation,\nzero-order, and Elovich) were tested for their suitability to describe the release\nof nonexchangeable K from six mineralogically different benchmark soils\n(i.e., Kamliakheri, Noyyal, Lukhi, Rarha, Kodad, and Vijayapura (Table 4).\nResults showed that parabolic diffusion equation described the reaction\nrates fairy well, as evidenced by the highest coefficient of determination\nvalues for 0.01 M CaCl 2 (r [2] \u00bc 0.92\u20130.99; mean \u00bc 0.98), 0.01 M citric acid\n(r [2] \u00bc 0.94\u20130.99; mean \u00bc 0.98), and 0.01 M HCl (r [2] \u00bc 0.73\u20130.98;\nmean \u00bc 0.93), respectively. The lowest standard error values ranged from\n0.02 to 0.05 (mean \u00bc 0.03) for CaCl 2, from 0.03 to 0.05 (mean \u00bc 0.03) for\ncitric acid, and from 0.03 to 0.08 (mean \u00bc 0.05) for HCl media. This result\nshows that rate of K release from nonexchangeable fraction is a function of\nthe reciprocal of [p] t and is diffusion controlled exchange reaction from the\nmineral matrix or weathered periphery. The fit of K t /K 0 and the [p] t for the\nthree benchmark surface and subsurface soils with varied mineralogy and K\nstatus is shown in Figure 2. Successful description of K release by parabolic\ndiffusion equation of K was reported by Martin and Sparks (1983) for\nKalmia and Kennansville soils of the United States and by Dhillon et al.\n(1989) and Srinivasarao et al. (2000) for some Indian soils. However, there\nwere some differences in r [2] and SE values of parabolic diffusion equation\namong soil series and extraction media. Relatively higher r [2] and lower SE\nvalues were observed for illitic and kaolinitic soils than for smectitic soils.\nAmong the media, citric acid and CaCl 2 showed higher r [2] and lower SE\nvalues. Followed by parabolic diffusion equation, first-order kinetic\nequation also explained well the nonexchangeable K release from soils as\nindicated by higher mean r [2] values of 0.94 in all three extractants and lower\nSE ranging from 0.26 to 0.29 (Table 4). The performance of first-order\nequation holds good irrespective of extraction medium, but it explained\nbetter for smectitic soils (r [2] \u00bc 0.95\u20130.96) than for kaolinitic soils\n(r [2] \u00bc 0.91\u20130.92). Almost linear relationships between ln (K 0 2 K t ) vs. time\nin different extraction media are presented in Figure 3. Successful description\n\n\nTable 4.

There were considerable differences\n\nin rate constants between surface and subsurface soils.\n\nFirst-order release rate constants showed larger values for smectitic soils\nfollowed by illitic and kaolinitic soils. For all soils, 0.01 M citric acid medium\nshowed greater release rate constants followed by 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M\nHCl. The rate constants for smectitic soils varied from 99.99 to\n101.55 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h, for illitic soils from 81.02 to 91.38 \ufffd 10 [\u20134] /h, and for\nkaolinitic soils from 63.81 to 81.26 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h. The mean rate constants for\nall the soils were 91.40 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h in citric acid, 84.45 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h in CaCl 2\nand 81.47 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h in HCl media. The rate constants observed in the\npresent study were comparable with those reported by Munn et al. (1976)\nfor K release from soil separates (22.8\u201356.2 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h) and Srinivasarao\net al. (1998) for some smectitic soils of central India (126\u2013153 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h)\nin 0.01 M CaCl 2 . In all the soils 20\u201350% of K release occurred within 7 h\nof extraction period. Thereafter, the release was a slow and continuing\nprocess. The rapid initial release may be from the easily accessible sites on\nthe external planar surfaces and peripheral edge sites, whereas the later\nslow release may be from the interlayer sites of the clay complex (Bolt\net al. 1963). In all the soil groups, the finer the soil texture, the higher were\nthe rate constants. Smectitic soils with higher clay content and larger edge\nand wedge sites showed greater release rate constants. Higher K release\nrates in citric acid medium compared with CaCl 2 and HCl indicates greater\nmobilization of K by citric acid, especially during the later stages of K\nrelease by complexing organic ligands (Song and Huang 1988). This trend\nwas very much pronounced in illitic soil series (Table 3). This finding\nwas in accordance with Sposito\u2019s hypothesis that the surface bearing\ncharged siloxane ditrigonal cavities in soils reacts with dissolved organic\nmatter and forms complexes through exchangeable cations (Sposito 1984).\nLower K release rate constants in CaCl 2 could be due to larger size of\nhydrated Ca [2][\u00fe] (4.3 A [\u02da ] ) than hydrated K [\u00fe] (3.3 A [\u02da ] ); therefore, wedge zones\nwould selectively screen out the Ca [2][\u00fe] ion because of its larger size (Martin\nand Sparks 1983).\nGreater K release rate constants in smectitic soils could be due to fine\ntexture and larger wedge zones, and its swelling clay where the exchange is\nrelatively easier, whereas K [\u00fe] in illitic soils is held tightly and exchange is\nslower. This may be the reason for better performance of first-order equation\nfor smectitic soils irrespective of medium. Kaolinitic soils with light texture\nand lower amounts of K mica/illitic and vermiculite showed lower K\nrelease rates. Although illite-dominant alluvial soils possess large amount of\nnonexchangeable K reserves (NaTPB-K) as shown in Table 1, its release is\nslower. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient values between soil test nonexchangeable K extracted in NaTPB and cumulative K release in different\nextraction media were lower (r [2] \u00bc 0.58\u20130.72). Once the illitic soils were\nexcluded, including smectitic and kaolinitic soils, r [2] values improved substantially (r [2] \u00bc 0.94\u20130.95). Because of this reason, illite-rich alluvial soils, even\n\n\nRelease Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 489\n\n\nthough with high nonexchangeable K status, may suffer from K deficiency\nunder intensive cropping because the rate of K release from nonexchangeable to exchangeable/solution phase is not sufficient to meet the plant K\nuptake.\nRate constants of parabolic diffusion equation in different media ranged\nfrom 28.03 to 36.08 \ufffd 10 [2][3] /h for smectitic soils, 28.84 to 41.25 \ufffd 10 [2][3] /h\nfor illitic soils, and 27.30 to 40.78 \ufffd 10 [2][3] /h for kaolinitic soils. Unlike\nthose of first-order equation, smectitic soils showed lower release rate\nconstants than illitic and kaolinitic soils in all the three media of extraction.\n\nRelease rate constants of parabolic diffusion equation depend on diffusion\ngradient between interlayer (source) and exchange surfaces (sink) in the\nclay structure because it assumes that the rate-limiting step is the diffusion\nof K ions from the interior of the particle to surface. Lower exchangeable K\non clay surface and larger interlayer K in illite clay structure resulted in\nlarger diffusion gradients in illitic soils, hence the higher release rate\nconstants than smectitic and kaolinitic soils. This finding may be the most\nprobable reason for better performance of parabolic diffusion equation in\nillitic soils. The lowest magnitude of parabolic rate constants in case of\nsmectitic black soils could be attributed to higher clay content.\nSimilarly intercept (a) values of the first-order and parabolic models were\nhigher for smectitic soils followed by illitic and kaolinitic soils (Table 5). The\npositive and highly significant correlation (r [2] \u00bc 0.94) between nonexchangeable K extracted in NaTPB and intercept values of the first-order equation as\nthe extrapolated intercept is assumed to be proportional to the initial concentration in soil solution at time \u00bc 0. Therefore, the higher the intercept values,\nthe greater was the initial soil test K (Elkhatib and Hern 1988).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nFor assessing K fertilizer needs, the information on nonexchangeable K\nrelease from smectitic, illitic soils, and kaolinitic soils should be taken into\nconsideration. The study further indicated that the 0.01 M citric acid\nextracted more K than did 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M HCl in these soils.\nFurthermore, citric acid medium was found to be superior in extracting nonexchangeable K from illitic soils compared with smectitic and kaolinitic\nsoils. The better fit of the first-order model to the data for smectitic soils\nthan for illitic soils and also the relatively better fit of the parabolic model\nto the data for illitic soils than for smectitic soils would suggest that the\nrate-limiting step is either film diffusion or exchange reaction for smectites\n(due to their swelling nature) and intraparticular diffusion for illites (the interlayer space being more closed). Thus, the information generated from\nthe different kinetic models can help to explain the release mechanisms in\nmineralogically dissimilar soils.\n\n\n490 Ch.
