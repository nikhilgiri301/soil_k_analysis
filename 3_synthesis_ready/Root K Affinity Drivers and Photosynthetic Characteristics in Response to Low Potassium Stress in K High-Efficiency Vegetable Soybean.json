Merr.] with different K efficiency. Two K high-efficiency\nvegetable soybean genotypes (Line 19 and Line 20) and two K low-efficiency genotypes\n(Line 7 and Line 36) were investigated in low K and normal K conditions. The root\nof K high-efficiency genotypes had a higher K [+] affinity associated with a higher\nmaximum K [+] uptake rate ( _I_ max), but lower Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption ( _K_ m)\nand lower compensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min). Seedlings of K highefficiency genotypes also had higher root vigor [triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)\nreduction method] and greater absorbing activity (methylene blue method), especially\nin the low K condition. Furthermore, the root bleeding-sap rate of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes in low K stress was 9.9\u201324.3% greater than that of normal K conditions,\n\nwhich was accompanied by a relatively higher K concentration of root bleeding-sap\nin contributing to K [+] upward flux. The root of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean\ngenotypes exhibited K [+] high-affinity and driving advantages. Photosynthetic parameters\nof K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes were less affected by low K stress.\nLow K stress decreased the net photosynthetic rate of K high-efficiency genotypes by\n6.1\u20136.9%, while that of K low-efficiency genotypes decreased by 10.9\u201315.7%. The\nhigher chlorophyll (Chl) a/b ratio with enhanced relative content of Chl a in response\nto low K stress might be an adapted mechanism for K high-efficiency genotypes\nto maintain photosynthetic capacity. Stronger root K affinity drivers associated with\n\nphotosynthetic adaptability to low K stress are the key factors in determining the K\nhigh-efficiency of vegetable soybeans.\n\n\nKeywords: potassium, potassium efficiency, bleeding sap, chlorophyll a/b ratio, vegetable soybean\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 1 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nPotassium application benefits vegetable soybean yield and\nquality (Liu et al., 2017), while the direct absorption and\nutilization of available potassium by plants in cultivated soil\nare always essential (Singh and Reddy, 2017; Chen et al., 2020;\nDev et al., 2021). Selecting and breeding potassium (K) efficient\nvarieties of vegetable soybean is an important biological means\nin making full use of K resources (Rengel and Damon, 2008).\nPrevious studies have shown that there are great differences in K\nefficiency among different genotypes. For instance, intraspecific\nvariations in K efficiency have been reported in many crops\nincluding rice (Yang et al., 2003), wheat (Zhang et al., 1999;\nDamon and Rengel, 2007), sweet potato (Wang et al., 2015),\ntomato (Chen and Gabelman, 1995), and soybean (Sale and\nCampell, 1987; Wang C. et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019b).\nDifferences in the K efficiency of crops can be understood\nfrom two main aspects, such as (1) the difference in K uptake\nefficiency and (2) the difference in K utilization efficiency (Rengel\nand Damon, 2008). The utilization efficiency of K refers to the\nability of the crop to convert unit K into dry matter yield (Wang\net al., 2018). K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes are\ngood at redistributing K and dry matters with higher harvest\nindex (HI) and higher K harvest index (KHI) (Liu et al.,\n2019b). K uptake efficiency emphasizes the capacity of root K\nabsorption (Tsialtas et al., 2017). The higher specific K uptake rate\n(total K content/total root length) in K high-efficiency vegetable\nsoybean genotypes ensures the supply of K to the whole plant.\nBesides, K high-efficiency genotypes also have a strong ability\nto regulate their root architecture to adapt to low K conditions\n(Liu et al., 2019a).\nExcept for root morphology, K uptake kinetic parameters,\nroot bleeding-sap, and root vigor are also demonstrated as\neffective parameters in evaluating K uptake efficiency (Teo\net al., 1992; Hao et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,\n2017). Sufficient K can increase plant hydraulic conductance and\ntranspiration (Pettigrew, 2008). The vigorous root can increase\nnutrient and water uptake, promoting the whole plant growth.\nFor instance, the root bleeding-sap and the upward fluxes of\nK are higher in the cotton cultivars with high K efficiency\n(Yang, 2011). As substrates for photosynthesis, water and mineral\nelements absorbed by plant roots are transported upward by\ntranspiration (Liu et al., 2016). Improved root characteristics\nmay contribute to plant-water status, enhanced photosynthesis,\nbiomass, and yield of soybean cultivars (Cui et al., 2016). In\ncotton, K efficient genotype 103 has more suitable K absorption\nkinetic parameters and more efficient photosynthate transport\n(Hao et al., 2015, 2016). Thus, the uptake power of the root\nsystem determines the supply of nutrients in the above-ground\npart of the plant.\nLess photosynthetic assimilates and reduced assimilate\ntransport out of the leaves to the developing fruit greatly\ncontribute to the negative consequences that deficiencies of\nK have on yield and quality production (Pettigrew, 2008).\nGenotypic variations in photosynthetic decline caused by K\ndeficiency have been reported. For instance, compared with the\nK-inefficient cotton cultivar, the K-efficient cultivar has a higher\n\n\n\nnet photosynthetic rate (Pn) associated with higher biomass\nproducts (Wang N. et al., 2012).\nHence, understanding how plants take up and use K\nis of scientific and practical importance. Research into this\nmechanism has become increasingly urgent as a result of major\necological and agricultural issues. In our previous studies, K\nhigh-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes were demonstrated\nwith a strong K uptake and redistribution ability (Liu et al.,\n2019a,b). However, the root uptake dynamics and photosynthetic\ncharacteristics of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean are still\nnot clear. Therefore, this study compared the differences of\nroot activity, root bleeding-sap, the upward fluxes of K, K\nkinetics parameters, photosynthetic parameters, and chlorophyll\ncontent between K high-efficiency and K low-efficiency vegetable\nsoybean genotypes. The data obtained revealed the mechanisms\nunderlying K absorption and utilization of high-efficiency in\nvegetable soybean.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nPlant Material\n\nBased on previous K efficiency selection (Liu et al., 2019a), two\nK high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes (Line 19 and Line\n20) and two K low-efficiency genotypes (Line 7 and Line 36) were\nused in this study. Compared with K low-efficiency genotypes, the\nK high-efficiency genotypes have higher K agronomic efficiency\n(KAE), recovery, internal utilization-efficiency rate (KIUE), and\nspecific K uptake rate (Liu et al., 2019a,b). Greater reductions\nin K concentration of vegetative organs were found in K highefficiency genotypes than K low-efficiency genotypes in low K\nconditions (Liu et al., 2019b). All genotypes were released by\nthe Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, Harbin, China.\n\n\nExperimental Design\nA pot experiment was conducted at the agronomy farm of\nNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, Harbin, China (45 [\u25e6] 732N, 126 [\u25e6] 612E;\naltitude 128 m a.s.l.) in 2017. The soil used was a typical Mollisol\n(Black soil) with the following properties: soil pH 6.6, organic\nmatter 28.9 g kg [\u2212][1], total N 2.3 g kg [\u2212][1], total P 1.3 g kg [\u2212][1], total K\n18.9 g kg [\u2212][1], available N 159 mg kg [\u2212][1], available P 57.0 mg kg [\u2212][1],\nand available K 85 mg kg [\u2212][1] (insufficient for vegetable soybean\nyield and quality; Liu et al., 2017). The experiment was conducted\nin a completely random design with three replicates and five pots\nper replicate. About 3 seeds per pot were sown in May 2017 with\nregular manual pest and weed control. The pot size was 32 cm in\ndiameter by 27 cm tall. A uniform fertilizer application at seeding\nincluded 70 kg ha [\u2212][1] diammonium phosphate and 98 kg ha [\u2212][1]\n\nurea. Treatments consisted of two K-fertilizer rates at seeding,\nK 2 SO 4 0 kg ha [\u2212][1] (K0) and K 2 SO 4 120 kg ha [\u2212][1] (K120). Plants\nwere randomly harvested at fourth-node (V4), full bloom (R2),\nbeginning seed (R5), and full seed (R6) stages (Fehr et al., 1971)\nfor root bleeding-sap and K upward fluxes measurement.\nA hydroponic experiment was used for K [+] absorption kinetic\nparameters, root vigor, and root absorbing activity test. Seeds\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 2 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\n\nof the four selected genotypes were sterilized and germinated\non moistened filter paper in a plant growth chamber at 60%\nhumidity and 28 [\u25e6] C, under a 16 h light, 8 h dark cycle for 3\u2013\n4 days. After that, the seedlings were transferred into light-proof\nglass boxes (volume 15 cm [3] \u00d7 20 cm [3] \u00d7 20 cm [3] ) with halfstrength modified Hoagland nutrient solution, as described by\nWang C. et al. (2012). There were six replications in each box.\nThe cotyledons of all samples were excised to eliminate any\nadditional supply of nutrients. When the plants grew to the\nfirst trifoliolate stage (V1), they were treated with half-strength\nHoagland nutrient solution with different concentrations of\nK [+] (0.5 and 3 mmol L [\u2212][1] ). The K source was K 2 SO 4 . The\ninitial pH value of the nutrient solution was 6, which was\nadjusted by 0.1 mol L [\u2212][1] NaOH or 0.1 mol L [\u2212][1] HCl. After\ntransplanting, the samples were continuously cultured for 9 days.\nThe nutrient solution was changed every 3 days and kept\nenough O 2 by regular ventilation with an air pump. The pH\nvalue of the solution was adjusted to 6 when the nutrient\nsolution was changed.\n\n\nMeasurements\n\nCollection of root bleeding-sap: root bleeding-sap collection was\nbased on the method used by Cui et al. (2016) with slight\nimprovements in the pot experiments. The root bleeding-sap\nwas conducted from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at V4, R2, R5,\nand R6 stages. The plants were cut with branch scissors at\ncotyledons position, and the cross-section was cleaned with\na small amount of absorbent cotton and then immediately\nconnected to the root bleeding-sap collection device and the\njoint was sealed. The collected root bleeding-sap was temporarily\nstored in a refrigerator at 4 [\u25e6] C for measurement. The formula was\nas follows: root bleeding-sap rate (g h [\u2212][1] per plant) = bleedingsap weight/4 h.\nWhere K upward fluxes = root bleeding-sap rate \u00d7 K\nconcentration, K concentration was determined by flame\nspectrophotometer (INESA FP6400A, Shanghai, China) (Liu\net al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2017).\nK [+] absorption kinetic parameters: A measurement of a\ndepletion curve of a single plant. Five replicates per genotype\nwere conducted. After K deficiency and starvation for 48 h,\nsamples under the treatment of K3 at 9 days were immersed\nin 0.2 mmol L [\u2212][1] CaSO 4 solutions three times, dried, and put\ninto a 200 ml absorption solution. The composition of the\nabsorption solution was 0.05 mmol L [\u2212][1] potassium chloride\n(KCl) + 0.2 mmol L [\u2212][1] CaSO 4 . The absorption solution\nwas placed in a dark conical flask, the culture temperature\nwas (25 \u00b1 2) [\u25e6] C, and the light intensity was 210\u2013260 mol\nm [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] . Parameter calculation including the maximum K [+]\n\nuptake rate ( _I_ max), Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption\n(Km), compensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min), and\nstatistical analysis refers to the modified method of Epstein\nand Hagen (1952) and Claassen and Barber (1977). _C_ min\nrepresents the concentration of K [+] in the solution when\nthe concentration remains constant. Ion consumption curve\nequation: Y = a + bX + cX [2] (1), take the negative derivative\nof the equation: Y\u2019 = b + 2cX (2). Hence, if X goes to 0,\nthen Y\u2019 = b = Km.\n\n\n\nRoot vigor, as determined by enzymatic reduction assay of\ntriphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was conducted according\nto the modified protocol of Duncan and Widholm (2004).\nRoot absorption activity was determined by methylene blue\nadsorption (Zhang and Yan, 2003; Song and Wang, 2005). First,\nthe root volume is converted to 1 ml = 1 g. The root was put\ninto a solution with a known concentration of methylene blue for\n1.5 min. Removed and placed the root into the second beaker,\nrepeated twice. Colorimetric determination of methylene blue\nwas conducted in the remaining solution in the three beakers\nat 660 nm using the UV-visible spectrophotometer (PERSEE T6,\nBeijing, China).\n\n\nTotal absorbing area _(_ m [2] _)_ = [ _(_ C1 \u2212 C1 [\u2032] _)_ \u00d7 V1] \u00d7\n1 _._ 1 + [ _(_ C2 \u2212 C2 [\u2032] _)_ \u00d7 V2] \u00d7 1 _._ 1\n\n\nActively absorbing area _(_ m [2] _)_ = [ _(_ C3 \u2212 C3 [\u2032] _)_ \u00d7 V3] \u00d7 1 _._ 1\n\n\nThe ratio of actively absorbing area to total absorbing area _(_ % _)_\n= 100 \u00d7 actively absorbing area _/_ total absorbing area\n\n\nThe ratio of the total absorbing area to root volume _(_ m [2] cm [\u2212][3] _)_\n= Total absorbing area _/_ Root volume\n\n\nWhere C, the original concentration of the solution\n(mg ml [\u2212][1] ); C [\u2032], the concentration of the solution after leaching\n(mg ml [\u2212][1] ); 1, 2, 3 is the beaker number; V, Volume of the\nsolution; When 1 mg methylene blue forms a monolayer, it\ncovers an area of 1.1 m [2] (Zhang and Yan, 2003).\nPhotosynthetic properties of the youngest fully expanded\nmain-stem leaf (the third leaf from the apex) were determined\nat 10:00\u201312:00 am at V4, R2, R4 (full pod), R5, and R6 stages\nwith a Li-6800 (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, United States) at 25 [\u25e6] C,\n60% relative humidity, 500 \u00b5mol mol [\u2212][1] CO 2 concentration, and\n1,200 \u00b5mol m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] quantum flux.\nDetermination of chlorophyll (Chl) content (Wang et al.,\n2021) was conducted using 0.2 g fresh leaves which were cut into\npieces and put into a 50 ml centrifuge tube.

The\ncompensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min) in K highefficiency genotypes was 0.83\u20131.32 \u00b5mol L [\u2212][1], which was lower\nthan that of K low-efficiency genotypes (3.16\u20133.22 \u00b5mol L [\u2212][1] )\n( _P_ <0.05). The Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption (Km) is\na parameter evaluating the affinity between root and K [+] . The\ngreater the value, the smaller the affinity.

The root bleeding-sap rate per plant of Line 20 was\nthe highest among the four genotypes with 1.8 ml h [\u2212][1] root [\u2212][1] in\nK0 and 1.6 ml h [\u2212][1] root [\u2212][1] in K120, respectively. Compared with\nK120 treatment, K0 treatment increased the average of the root\nbleeding-sap rate per plant over the four stages by 9.9\u201324.3% in\nK high-efficiency genotypes, but by \u20132.2\u20135.1% in K low-efficiency\ngenotypes. On the other hand, the root bleeding-sap rate per root\nlength in four genotypes was found higher at the V4\u2013R2 stage,\ndropped down at the R5\u2013R6 stage. Interestingly, K high-efficiency\ngenotypes had a higher root bleeding-sap rate per root length\ncompared with K low-efficiency genotypes at the beginning seed\nstage ( _P <_ 0.05).

Meanwhile, K concentration of root bleeding-sap in\nK high-efficiency genotypes reached 51.1\u201363.2 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in K0\nand 60.2\u201364 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment at the beginning seed\nstage, which was significantly higher than that of K low-efficiency\ngenotypes with 41.1\u201348 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in K0 and 46.1\u201352.4 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in\nK120 treatment ( _P <_ 0.05).\nCorrelation analysis revealed that K upward fluxes rate\nper root length and K concentration of root bleeding-sap\nwere positively correlated with K concentration per plant\n( _P <_ 0.05) ( **Table 2** ).\n\n\nRoot Vigor and Absorbing Activity\nThe root vigor was tested in a hydroponic experiment using the\nmeasurement of respiratory activity with triphenyl tetrazolium\nchloride (TTC) ( **Figure 3** ). At the seedling stage (9 days after\ntreatment), the root vigor of K high-efficiency genotypes was\ninduced by low K stress. Low K stress (K0.5) increased the root\nvigor of K high-efficiency genotypes by 46\u201385% compared with\nnormal K treatment (K3) ( _P <_ 0.05). Although no consistent\ntrend was observed in K low-efficiency genotypes, low K stress\ndecreased root vigor by 21% in Line 36 ( _P <_ 0.05). The highest\nroot vigor of 516 \u00b5g g [\u2212][1] FW h [\u2212][1] was found in Line 20 under\nlow K conditions.\nThe root absorbing activity parameters are shown in **Table 3** .\nHigher total absorbing area and actively absorbing area were\nfound in K high-efficiency genotypes. Meanwhile, in K highefficiency genotypes, low K stress increased the actively absorbing\narea by 21.4\u201330.6% and the total absorbing area by 9.6\u201319%\n( _P <_ 0.05). In contrast, an opposite trend was found in\nK low-efficiency genotypes. Under low K stress, the actively\nabsorbing area decreased by 6.1\u201310.3% and the total absorbing\narea decreased by 6.6\u201315.7% ( _P >_ 0.05). Furthermore, K highefficiency genotypes also had a higher ratio of total absorbing\narea to root volume, especially in Line 19 with 62.3 m [2] cm [\u2212][3]\n\n(K0.5) and 60.2 m [2] cm [\u2212][3] (K3). Low K stress increased the ratio\nof actively absorbing area to total absorbing area by 9.3\u20139.4%\nin K high-efficiency genotype ( _P <_ 0.05), but by 0.6\u20135% in K\nlow-efficiency genotypes ( _P >_ 0.05).\n\n\nComparison of Photosynthetic\nParameters Between Two K Efficiency\nGenotypes\nA pot experiment was conducted to determine photosynthetic\nparameters of two K efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes\naffected by K deficiency (K0) are shown in **Figure 4** .

From full\nbloom to full seed stage, the Pn increased first and then decreased.\nThe maximum value occurred at the full pod (R4) stage of the\nK low-efficiency genotype Line 36, which reached 28.8 \u00b5mol\nCO 2 m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] and 33.8 \u00b5mol CO 2 m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] under K0 and\nK120 treatments, respectively. Meanwhile, from full pod to full\nseed stage, the dramatic decline of the Pn was found in K lowefficiency genotypes. The Pn of Line 36 decreased by 87.2% in\nK0 and 86.2% in K120 treatment ( _P <_ 0.05), and that of Line 7\ndecreased by 54.3% in K0 and 59% in K120 treatment. Whereas\nthe decline of the Pn in K high-efficiency genotypes was around\n33.5\u201351.8% in K0 and 36.7\u201341.1% in K120 treatment, which was\nnot as much as that of K low-efficiency genotypes.\nPotassium deficiency also decreased the stomatal conductance\n(Gs) in all genotypes, but K high-efficiency genotypes were less\naffected. The decrease of Gs by K deficiency was 7.5\u20137.8% in\nK high-efficiency genotypes, but 9.4\u201312.5% in K low-efficiency\ngenotypes. Low K treatment had the most obvious effect on Gs\nat the beginning seed stage.\nAs opposed to Pn and Gs, K deficiency increased the\nintercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci), especially in K lowefficiency genotypes. The increase of Ci by K deficiency was\n7.3\u20137.9% in K low-efficiency genotypes, but 2\u20136% in K highefficiency genotypes.\n\n\n\nPotassium deficiency decreased the transpiration rate (Tr)\nof all genotypes. Across the five stages, Tr of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes was around 8.8\u20139.8 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K0 and\n9\u201310.1 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment, which was\nhigher than that of 7.1\u20138.2 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K0 and 7.1\u2013\n8.6 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment in K low-efficiency\ngenotypes. At the full seed stage, higher Tr was found in K highefficiency genotypes with 4\u20134.5 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K0 and\n4.2\u20134.7 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment, but only 1\u2013\n1.2 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] and 1.4 \u20131.6 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in\nK low-efficiency genotypes.\n\n\nChlorophyll\nPot experiment indicated that K deficiency significantly\ndecreased leaf chlorophyll content of the four vegetable soybean\ngenotypes ( **Table 4** ). The average total Chl content in the\nfour growth stages of K high-efficiency genotypes was 2.29\u2013\n2.53 mg g [\u2212][1] in K0 and 2.89\u20132.91 mg g [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment,\nwhich was lower than that of K low-efficiency genotypes\nwith 2.57\u20133.2 mg g [\u2212][1] in K0 and 3.08\u20133.5 mg g [\u2212][1] in K120\ntreatment. However, K deficiency increased the ratio of Chl\na to Chl b, especially in K high-efficiency genotypes. The\nratio of Chl a to Chl b was increased by 36.2\u201338.1% in K\nhigh-efficiency genotypes ( _P <_ 0.05), but only by 6\u20139.8% in K\nlow-efficiency genotypes.\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 5 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al.

The results indicated that K high-efficiency\nvegetable soybean genotypes against low K condition by\nincreasing root bleeding-sap rate per plant and maintaining\nhigher root bleeding-sap rate per root length at the beginning\nseed stage. The root bleeding-sap rate of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes in low K stress was 9.9\u201324.3% greater than that of\nnormal K conditions, which was accompanied by the relatively\nhigher K concentration of root bleeding-sap in contributing to\nK [+] upward flux. In K high-efficiency cotton cultivars, higher root\nbleeding-sap and K upward fluxes could also be induced by low\nK stress (Yang, 2011). Suitable grafting would help watermelon\nseedlings accumulate more K by increasing root bleeding-sap\nvolume and the total K in the root bleeding-sap (Huang et al.,\n2013). Due to the rate of root bleeding-sap is closely related to\nplant nutrient supply, water transport, and even photosynthesis\n(Guan et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), increased rate\nof root bleeding-sap under K deficiency might be an important\nregulatory mechanism for vegetable soybean efficient uptake K.\nBesides, beginning seed stage is a most important period for seed\nestablishment, the higher root bleeding-sap rate per root length\nin K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes accompanied\nby higher K upward fluxes rate per root length and higher K\nconcentration of root bleeding-sap is positively correlated with\nplant K concentration ( _P <_ 0.05). This is another evidence\ndemonstrating that the root of K high-efficiency genotypes has a\nstronger affinity for K [+] .\nPotassium kinetic parameters and root activities are also\nimportant factors assessing K efficiency when plants suffering\nlow K stress (Silberbush and Barber, 1983; Cui et al., 2016;\nWhite et al., 2018). The present study revealed a lower\nMichaelis constant ( _K_ m) and compensation concentration for\nK [+] uptake ( _C_ min), and a higher maximum K [+] uptake rate\n( _I_ max) from K high-efficiency genotypes, compared with K\nlow-efficiency genotypes. Lower _K_ m and _C_ min indicate higher\naffinity between the roots and K [+] and stronger ability to use\n\n\n\nthe low-concentration K [+], while higher _I_ max ensures a faster\nK uptake rate (Glass, 1980; Teo et al., 1992). The absorption\nkinetic parameters of ion uptake are useful indexes of the level\nof adaptation of the genotype to the nutrient condition in the\nsoil (Crowley, 1975; Daniel et al., 2020). The study of Hao et al.\n(2015) also recognized that K kinetic parameters could be used to\ntest crop low-K adaptability. Therefore, it was reasonable to say\nthat K high-efficiency genotypes had better K adaptability than\nK low-efficiency genotypes. On the other hand, root activity is\nanother important heritable trait in evaluating root absorption\nability, which also influences nutrients acquisition and initial\ncanopy cover and, thereby, crop yields (Liu et al., 2015; Cui\net al., 2016; White et al., 2018). In the present study, both root\nvigor and absorbing activity (including actively absorbing area,\ntotal absorbing area, and the ratio of actively absorbing area to\ntotal absorbing area) were consistently enhanced by low K stress\nin K high-efficiency genotypes, while those of K low-efficiency\ngenotypes are inhibited. This kind of difference can be regulated\nby plant phytohormones (Yang, 2011), which were controlled by\nspecific genes and pathways (Liu et al., 2020). Therefore, K highefficiency genotypes are more adapted to low K stress through\nregulating root K affinity drivers, which is beneficial for the\nupward flux of nutrients (Liu et al., 2015).\nPhotosynthetic parameters affected by K levels are direct\nreferences to characterize the photosynthetic capacity of\ncrops (Wang Y. et al., 2020). Hence, it is important to\nexamine the photosynthetic characteristics of vegetable\nsoybean with different K efficiency types. In the present\nstudy, photosynthetic parameters are less affected by low K\nin K high-efficiency genotypes. The _Pn_ of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes decreased by 6.1\u20136.9% and K low-efficiency\ngenotypes by 10.9\u201315.7%. Many investigations also indicate\nthat crops with high K efficiency should be more efficient in\nphotosynthesis or that photosynthetic capacity is less affected\nby low K stress (Wang et al., 2014). For instance, under K\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 8 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\nFIGURE 5 | Schematic diagram demonstrating efficient K absorption and photosynthetic assimilation in K high-efficiency vegetable soybean under low K condition.\n\n\n\ndeficiency, _Pn_ of K-efficient cotton cultivar Liaomian 18 is\n19.4% higher than that of K-inefficient cultivar NuCOTN99 [B] .\nBesides, photosynthetic parameters of Liaomian 18 were less\naffected by low K stress (Wang N. et al., 2012). However,\nthe present study did not find absolute superiority of _Pn_\nin K high-efficiency genotypes, but they have a higher\nHI and KHI [the relevant results have been published by\nLiu et al. (2019b)]. A high HI is fundamental to efficient\nutilization of all resources taken up by the plant, and\nthe photosynthate transport and distribution rather than\nphotosynthesis rate are critical for low K adaptation in\nK high-efficiency genotypes (Rengel and Damon, 2008;\nHao et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nConsistent with photosynthetic parameters, Chl content also\nreflects the photosynthetic activity in leaves (Szafra\u00b4nska et al.,\n2017; Choudhury et al., 2019). In the present study, K highefficiency vegetable soybean genotypes exhibit lower total Chl\ncontent but greater Chl a/b ratio when suffering low K stress.\nThe effect of photosynthetic photon flux density on the leaf Chl\na/b ratio is one of the most characteristic differences between\nsun and shade leaves (Abtahi et al., 2019). Typically, total Chl\ncontent per unit leaf area is lower and the Chl a/b ratio is\ngreater in sun compared with shade soybean leaves (Anderson,\n1986; Fritschi and Ray, 2007). The higher Chl a/b ratio with\nenhanced relative content of Chl a in response to low K stress\nmight be an adapted mechanism for K high-efficiency genotypes\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 9 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\n\nto maintain photosynthetic capacity because Chl a is the main\npigment in leaves that absorbs light energy, which ensures\nlight absorption as much as possible (Abtahi et al., 2019).\nSimilar results were also revealed in the research of Wang et al.\n(2008). Besides, low K stress decreased leaf K [+] concentration\nof vegetable soybean, but K high-efficiency genotypes were\nless affected (Liu et al., 2019a). This could be an important\ninternal factor affecting the chlorophyll regulation ability of K\nhigh-efficiency vegetable soybean. The present study recognized\nthat the high efficiency of photosynthesis, including more\nadaptable photosynthetic parameters and Chl proportion, was\nessential for K utilization efficiency in K high-efficiency vegetable\nsoybean genotypes.\nIt is root uptake power that drives up nutrients transport,\nwhile photosynthetic capacity and assimilate redistribution\ncapacity are the key to crop yield (He et al., 2019). In the present\nstudy, K high-efficiency vegetable soybean was found to have\nobvious advantages in root K affinity drivers, which ensured the\nupward supply of K and other nutrients. Thus, the photosynthetic\nsystem of K high-efficiency genotypes was less susceptible to low\nK conditions and has a stronger regulation ability, ensuring the\nefficiency of K utilization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe higher affinity of root to K [+] associated with root activity\nunder low K stress is essential to promote root K absorption.\nThe strong drivers, represented with higher root bleeding-sap\nrate and Tr induced by low K stress, ensure the upward flux\nof K [+] and other essential nutrients as much as possible.

Therefore, the ability to\nredistribute photosynthetic products seemed more important\nthan photosynthetic capacity in K high-efficiency genotypes\n( **Figure 5** ). Overall, crop K high-efficiency should be holistic,\nand the factors involved are not isolated. Stronger root K affinity\ndrivers associated with photosynthetic adaptability to low K stress\nwere the key factors in determining the K high-efficiency of\nvegetable soybeans.\n\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmade available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n\nXL and QZ designed the experiments, supervised the study, and\nrevised the manuscript.
