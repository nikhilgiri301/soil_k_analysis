This has raised concerns, since updated knowledge of\nnutrient requirements at various stages of oil palm growth is essential for formulating fertilizer\nrecommendations that meet agronomic, economic, and environmental objectives. We therefore filled\nin this knowledge gap with the objective to quantify the standing biomass, dry-matter production,\nand nutrient demand of tenera oil palm of different ages, grown under current agronomic practices.\nTenera palms were sampled at 12, 29, 48, 88, 133, 209, and 238 months since nursery planting and\nseparated into spear leaves, leaflets, rachis, petiole, leaf bases, cabbage, trunk, bole, and roots attached\nto bole for determination of dry weights and nutrient contents. Fruit bunches were harvested, with\ndry weights and nutrient contents of ripe bunches determined. Annual dry-matter production\nwas calculated from dry weights of different plant parts, and together with nutrient concentrations\ndetermined in these plant parts and fruit bunches, annual nutrient demand was calculated. Excluding\nroots, the total standing vegetative biomass increased almost linearly from 1.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months\nold to 808.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old. Whole-palm dry-matter production increased with palm\nage but at a decreasing rate, from 1.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 285.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nafter 133 months, with little increase thereafter. The maximum rates of nutrient demand occurred\n\nafter 209 months, coinciding with peak production of fruit bunches\u2014except for K, which occurred at\nmonth 88 when vegetative growth demand for K peaked. Annual gross amounts of nutrients required\nto produce 25 t fresh fruit bunches ha _[\u2212]_ [1] were 1.99 kg N, 0.28 kg P, 3.94 kg K, 0.42 kg Mg, 0.99 kg Ca,\nand 2.5 g B per palm. The net amounts of nutrients required to meet similar production level of fruit\nbunches were 1.04 kg N, 0.16 kg P, 1.85 kg K, 0.26 kg Mg, 0.47 kg Ca, and 1.3 g B per palm per year\nif all nutrients contained in the pruned leaves were recycled. These results provide much-needed\nupdated data on the dry-matter production and nutrient demand of tenera oil palm grown under\ncurrent agronomic practices and also serve as a general yardstick for practitioners to further refine\n\nfertilizer recommendations.\n\n\n**Keywords:** tenera; biomass; tree parts; nutrient concentration; nutrient partitioning\n\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\n\nOil palm ( _Elaeis guineensis_ Jacq.) is the most productive edible oil-producing crop,\nwith potential to produce up to 9.5 t oil ha _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 1 ]. It requires a large amount of nutrients\nsuch as N, P, K, Mg, and Ca to maintain its high levels of standing biomass and drymatter production [ 2 \u2013 6 ]. These nutrients are typically supplied by fertilizers, since oil\npalm is predominantly grown on highly weathered tropical soils with low soil-nutrient\nreserves [ 7, 8 ]. Fertilizers are thus essential for sustaining growth of oil palm and economic\nproduction of fresh fruit bunches, which can account up to 32% of total production cost of\n\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_ [, 426. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12020426](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12020426) [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy)\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 2 of 18\n\n\nfresh fruit bunches [ 9 ]. The high operating budget for fertilizers emphasizes the importance\nof more efficient use of fertilizers to maximize profitability of palm oil production while\nreducing potential detrimental effects of inorganic fertilizers on the environment [10].\nThe amount of nutrients required by a growing oil palm encompasses the amount of\nnutrients required to meet growth demand and deficiency demand [11], where deficiency\ndemand is the amount of nutrients required to correct nutrient deficiency, which can be\ndetermined through measurements of nutrient concentrations in the leaflet and rachis\ntissues [ 12 \u2013 14 ]. Meanwhile, growth demand is the amount of nutrients required to grow\nplant tissues such as spear leaves (unopened leaves), leaves, trunk, roots, and fresh fruit\nbunches, as well as to replace any plant tissues that are removed such as fresh fruit bunches,\nleaves and roots [ 11 ]. This growth demand for nutrients can be calculated from the amount\nof dry matter incorporated in the plant tissues and its nutrient concentrations.\nA few studies have investigated the dry-matter production [ 2, 15, 16 ] and nutrient\ncontent [ 2, 17 ] in oil palm through destructive measurement of oil palms of different ages.\nThis had allowed determination of growth demand for nutrients and enabled formulation\nof the fertilizer requirement for oil palm. However, the oil palms sampled were mostly\nof the thick-shelled dura that has since been replaced by the thin-shelled tenera as the\nprimary commercial oil-palm planting material [ 11 ] because of its higher oil-yield potential\n( 9.5 t oil ha _[\u2212]_ [1] ) [1] . The higher oil-yield potential of tenera may be associated with greater\ntotal plant nutrient demand, and this nutrient demand is best determined through destructive measurements. However, this was not practiced until the work by Teoh and Chew [ 18 ]\nand Goh et al. [ 4, 5 ] who studied the N, P, and K requirements of tenera. However, they restricted their measurements to mature palms aged between 12.5 and 19 years. More recently,\na similar study was conducted on 14-year-old tenera but with limited measurements on\nthe nutrient contents of fruit bunches, trunk tissue, and roots [ 6 ]. Other studies have been\nlimited to determining the nutrient content of tenera bunches [ 19, 20 ]. In one rare study, the\nmicronutrient boron requirement of 20\u201382 month-old tenera was investigated [ 21 ]. Since\nthen, there have been no such investigations carried out to determine the nutrient demand\nof tenera of different ages.\nTherefore, it is obvious that the palm-oil industry lacks comprehensive knowledge on\nthe nutrient demand of tenera at various stages of growth. Recent advances in oil-palm\nbreeding and agronomic practices may have further influenced the uptake, partitioning, and\naccumulation of nutrients in tenera since the last comprehensive studies were conducted\non tenera three decades ago [ 4, 5 ]. As such, data collected from dura are sometimes used to\nfill this gap. This has raised concerns, since updated knowledge of nutrient requirements\nat various stages of tenera growth is essential for formulating fertilizer recommendations\nthat meet agronomic, economic, and environmental objectives [ 22 ]. Goh et al. [ 21 ] found\nthat 20-to-82-month-old tenera required about 27% more boron than dura of the same age.\nTarmizi and Mohd Tayeb [ 6 ] found that N and K contents in tenera bunches were higher\nthan those in dura bunches by 5% and 6%, respectively, but the P and Mg contents were 16%\nlower than those in dura bunches. In another study, the N, P, K, and Mg contents in tenera\nbunches were 56, 54, 44, and 14% higher than those in dura bunches, respectively [ 19 ]. All\nthese findings suggest that tenera, which has higher oil-yield potential, requires a larger\namount of nutrients to sustain its productivity. As such, fertilizer recommendations based\non older nutrient demand data might not adequately support the increased oil production.\nIt is thus imperative that we reevaluate the nutrient uptake and partitioning patterns in\ntenera at different stages of growth.\nWe aimed to fill in this knowledge gap with the objective to quantify the standing\nbiomass, dry-matter production, and nutrient demand of tenera of different ages, grown\non inland sedentary soils under the current agronomic practices in Malaysia.\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 3 of 18\n\n\n**2. Materials and Methods**\n\n_2.1. Study Site_\n\n\nThis study was carried out in an oil-palm plantation located in Layang-Layang ( 1.81 _[\u25e6]_ N\n103.45 _[\u25e6]_ E), Johor, Malaysia. The plantation has 129 oil-palm blocks with a total planted area\nof 2935 hectares. Block size varies from 5.1 to 34.8 hectares. There are 13 soil types found in\nthe plantation but Harimau Series (Typic Paleudult), which is a deep, well-drained soil with\n30% clay, 3% silt, 34% fine sand, and 29% coarse sand, dominates 56.5% of the total planted\narea [ 23 ]. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of Hariamu Series is low at 4.09 cmol kg _[\u2212]_ [1],\nwith exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg at 0.11, 0.68 and 0.18 cmol kg _[\u2212]_ [1], respectively. Harimau\nSeries soil is moderately acidic, with a pH of 4.5, 0.13% total N, and 8.2 ppm available P.\nThe topography of the study site is undulating, with slopes ranging from 2 to 6 _[\u25e6]_ . Annual\nrainfall received from 2011 to 2019 averaged ( _\u00b1_ sd) at 2522 _\u00b1_ 66 mm, with 135 _\u00b1_ 3 rain days.\nMean annual air temperature averaged at 26.5 _\u00b1_ 0.5 _[\u25e6]_ C. The study site is thus deemed\nfavorable for growing oil palm [8,24].\n\n\n_2.2. Planting Materials_\n\n\nTenera (Deli Dura _\u00d7_ AVROS Pisifera) palms were sampled. These were fertilized\ncommercial palms grown under the current Sime Darby Plantation agromanagement\npractices. These palms were sampled from different blocks, where each block is planted\nwith one specific palm age. Most blocks were initially planted with 148 palms per hectare\nbut there are some blocks planted with higher densities of 160\u2013180 palms per hectare. Based\non the developed soil map by the Sime Darby Plantation, palms planted in blocks with\nsimilar terrains and with Harimau Series as dominant soil type were selected for sampling.\nThe age of palms at time of sampling were 12, 29, 48, 88, 133, 209, and 238 months old,\ncalculated from the time of nursery planting. Four palms from each age group were\nrandomly sampled. Stunted, abnormal, and roadside palms were excluded from sampling.\nThe 88-month-old palms sampled from a high-density planting block were healthy and\nnot etiolated at the time of sampling. Fertilizers were applied on an annual basis and\nthe last three years\u2019 fertilizer quantities applied to the sampled palms prior to destructive\nsampling were averaged and are provided in Table 1. The nursery palms (12 months old)\nonly received one year of fertilizer applications while the 29-month-old palms received one\nyear of fertilizer applications after field planting. Oil palm is normally raised in the nursery\nfor 12 months before transplanting in the field.\n\n\n**Table 1.** Average fertilizer rates applied to the sampled tenera palms prior to destructive sampling.\nSPH and n.a. denote actual stands per hectare at time of sampling, and not applicable, respectively.\n\n\n**Quantity of Nutrients Applied (kg palm** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **year** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **)**\n**Palm Age** **SPH**\n**(Months)** **N** **P** **K** **Mg** **Ca** **B**\n\n\n12 n.a. 0.04 0.02 0.02 0.01 0 0\n\n29 157 0.60 0.51 0.71 0.06 0.57 0\n\n48 148 0.66 0.40 1.06 0.12 0.52 0.009\n\n88 173 0.97 0.21 1.93 0.28 0.52 0.009\n\n133 150 0.89 0.24 1.91 0.26 0.72 0.009\n\n209 133 0.89 0.22 1.99 0.26 0.70 0.009\n\n238 134 0.85 0.21 1.85 0.23 0.63 0.009\n\n\n_2.3. Destructive Sampling_\n\n\nThe tenera palms selected for destructive sampling were harvested, uprooted, and\nseparated into different morphological components viz. leaves (further divided into leaflets,\nrachis, and petiole), leaf bases, spear leaves, cabbage, trunk, bole, roots, male and female\ninflorescences, and bunches [ 2, 18 ]. Figure 1 briefly illustrates the sampling of various\nparts of the oil palm. Root biomass may contain significant amounts of nutrients, but no\nmeasurement was made in this study.\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 4 of 18\n\n\n**Figure 1.** Destructive sampling of the tenera oil palm.

Left\u2014ripe bunch; middle and right\u2014unripe bunches.\n\n\n2.3.1. Leaves\n\n\nEach leaf was removed individually and divided into leaflets, rachis, and petiole.\nLeaflets were sampled systematically by sampling one leaflet for every ten leaflets until\nthe tip of the rachis for both sides of a leaf. These leaflets were then bulked, weighed,\nand treated separately for nutrient analysis. All remainder leaflets were cut off, bulked,\nweighed, and dried. Each of the rachis and petiole was cut into six and four equal parts\nrespectively, bulked and weighed. A 10-cm long subsample was cut from the middle of\neach part, bulked, weighed, dried and used for nutrient analysis. \u2018Spear leaves\u2019 (unopened\nleaves) were cut off from the crown after felling the sampled palm, numbered and cut into\nsix parts of equal length, bulked and weighed. A 10 cm long subsample was cut from the\nmiddle of each part, bulked, weighed, dried and used for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.2. Trunk\n\n\nAfter the removal of all leaves, the whole trunk was uprooted with the bole. The\nbole was separated from the trunk, then the trunk was further separated into upper and\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 5 of 18\n\n\nlower trunk parts, because the tissues of both trunk sections contain contrasting nutrient\nconcentrations [ 2 ]. The upper trunk, which supports the leaves, is defined as the section\nfrom the base of Leaf\u201341 to the base of Leaf\u20131 (Figure 1a). The upper trunk was cut into\nthree equal sections, and each section was weighed separately. A 15-cm thick subsection\nwas cut from the middle of each trunk section and weighed. Each trunk subsection was\nfurther cut into eight equal parts, and two one-eighth parts were taken randomly. These\nsubsamples were bulked separately, weighed, and used for nutrient analysis. The lower\ntrunk, which forms the major portion of palm trunk is defined as the section between the\nbase of Leaf\u201341 and the trunk base where the bole was separated (Figure 1b). The lower\ntrunk was then cut into three equal sections and treated in the same way as the upper trunk.\n\n\n2.3.3. Cabbage\n\n\nThe cabbage is the succulent tissue found at the apex of the upper trunk, which is\nbasically comprised of a soft mass of immature leaves and inflorescences that contain much\nhigher concentrations of nutrients. It was treated separately. The cabbage was cut out,\nchopped, dried, weighed, and taken for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.4. Bole\n\n\nThe bole was separated from the trunk, and soils attached to the bole and the roots\nwere removed by spraying with water. Roots attached to the bole were removed with\na sharp knife. The bole was weighed and then cut into eight longitudinal sections of\napproximate size. Two one-eighth sections were weighed and taken for nutrient analysis.\nAll roots removed from the bole were bulked and weighed, and about 2 kg of each of the\nroots was taken for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.5. Leaf Bases\n\n\nAll leaf bases attached to each section of upper and lower trunk were removed, bulked,\nand weighed. Two pieces of leaf bases from each section were randomly sampled, weighed\nand used for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.6. Fresh Fruit Bunches\n\n\nAll fruit bunches were harvested before palm felling and were separated into ripe\nand unripe bunches. Each bunch was weighed in the field and immediately taken to the\nlaboratory where each bunch was treated separately [ 6 ]. In the laboratory, every bunch\nwas stripped and separated into fruits, stalks, and spikelets with trash and weighed. All\nof the fruits were cleaned and separated, firstly into pericarp and nut, and were again\nweighed individually. The stalk, spikelet, and pericarp were diced. A maximum of 2 kg of\nsubsamples from stalk, spikelet, and pericarp component were dried overnight at 70 _[\u25e6]_ C\nbefore grinding in a mill. The nut was dried similarly and then cracked with a hammer to\nextract the kernel. After separation, the shell was placed in a canvas bag and crushed with\na hammer before grinding in a mill. The kernel was pounded up in a porcelain mortar. The\nground material was then quartered for a subsample of about 250 g. The stalk was cleaned\nand treated in the same way as the spikelet/trash.\n\n\n_2.4. Laboratory Analysis_\n\n\nAll palm organs were wiped clean with distilled water before they were cut into\nsmaller pieces and dried to a constant weight between 50 to 70 _[\u25e6]_ C using a Memmert\nlaboratory oven Model UF450 (Memmert GmbH, Schwabach, Germany). Total N in the\norgan samples was determined using the combustion method with an elemental analyzer\nwith temperature set at 900 _[\u25e6]_ C [ 25 ]; P was determined colorimetrically by the yellow\nphosphovanadate complex using the AutoAnalyzer after dry-ashing [ 26 ]; K, Mg, and Ca by\nthe Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer after dry-ashing [ 27 ]; and B by the Azomethine\nmethod using a UV Spectrophotometer after dry-ashing with H 2 SO 4 [28].\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 6 of 18\n\n\n_2.5. Data Analysis_\n2.5.1. Determination of Dry Weight\n\n\nTotal dry weight of a specific palm tissue, DW x (where x represents a specific tree part,\nsuch as spear leaves, leaflets, rachis, petiole, leaf bases, cabbage, trunk, or bole) for each\npalm age was determined as:\n\nDW x = W 0 _\u00d7_ [W] [2] (1)\n\nW 1\n\n\nwhere W 0 is the total fresh weight of a specific palm tissue, and W 1 and W 2 is the subsample fresh weight and dry weight of a specific palm tissue, respectively. All weights are\nin kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n\n\n2.5.2. Estimation of Dry-Matter Production\n\n\nDry weights determined for each replicate of spear leaves, trunk, and bole at months 12,\n29, 48, 88, 133, 209, and 238 were treated individually and subjected to nonlinear regression\nanalysis using TableCurve 2D version 5.1 (SYSTAT Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA, 2002)\nto estimate annual dry matter incorporated in spear leaves (DM spear ), trunk (DM trunk ),\nand bole (DM bole ). Models generated from the curve-fitting software were examined.\nParsimonious models with low fitting standard error and high R [2] were selected [ 29 ]. From\nthe fitted curves, monthly DM spear, DM trunk, and DM bole were then calculated and summed\nto give annual dry-matter production in kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] . Trunk dry matter includes\nthe cabbage and the upper and lower trunk. Annual leaf dry-matter production (DM leaf ;\nkg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ) was calculated following Corley et al. [16] as:\n\n\n\nDW leaf\nDM leaf =\n\ufffd FN\n\n\n\n_\u00d7_ FPR (2)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nwhere DW leaf is the total dry weight of leaves (kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] ) at the time of sampling, FN\nis the total number of leaves per palm at the time of sampling, and FPR is the 12-month\nperiod\u2019s total leaf numbers produced for the year preceding the destructive sampling\n( no. palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ). The number of leaves produced by the sampled palms was estimated\nfrom Equation (3), which was derived from three oil-palm planting-density trials carried\nout under the Malaysian inland environment (see Supplementary Figure S1), which is\nsimilar to the environment of this study [ 30 ]. The number of leaves produced in a month\nfor a given palm age was estimated as:\n\n\nFPR month = 2.9645 exp ( _\u2212_ age/380.6418 ) (3)\n\n\nwhere age is the palm age in months since nursery planting. Annual root dry-matter\nproduction (DM root ; kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ) was derived from the aboveground vegetative\ndry-matter production (VDM) estimated in this study as:\n\n\nDM root = VDM _\u00d7_ 0.104 (4)\n\n\nwhere 0.104 is the mean root-to-shoot ratio, calculated from Henson and Chai [ 31 ]. The\ndry weight of fresh fruit bunches (DM FFB ) in kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] for the year preceding\ndestructive sampling was calculated as:\n\n\n\nY FFB\nDM FFB =\n\ufffd SPH\n\n\n\n_\u00d7_ 0.5275 (5)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nwhere Y FFB is the 12-month period\u2019s total weight of fresh fruit bunches (kg ha _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ),\nSPH is the number of palms per hectare for the block from which the sampled palms were\ntaken, and 0.5275 is a constant used for converting the weight of fresh fruit bunches to the\ndry weight [32].\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 7 of 18\n\n\n2.5.3. Estimation of Nutrient Demand\n\n\nThe annual quantity of nutrient required to grow and maintain each palm organ (N _x_ ;\nkg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ) for each palm age was calculated as:\n\n\nN _x_ = DM _x_ _\u00d7_ C _x_ (6)\n\n\nwhere DM _x_ is the amount of dry matter incorporated in a specific palm organ over a year,\nand where _x_ represents bunches, spear leaves, leaves, trunk, bole, or roots. C _x_ (% dry\nmatter) is the concentration of a nutrient element for a specific palm organ, _x_ . The annual\nnutrient demand calculated for each vegetative organ was summed to give the annual\nnutrient demand for vegetative growth. The sum of nutrient demand for vegetative growth\nand bunch production gives the total nutrient demand.\n\n\n2.5.4. Statistical Analysis\n\n\nDry weight and dry-matter production data, and nutrient concentrations data collected\nfrom vegetative tissues and components of fruit bunches were analyzed using JMP [\u00ae] Version\n14 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, 2021). The growth stages of tenera were divided into\nnursery (12 months old), immature (29\u201348 months old), and mature ( 88\u2013238 months old ).\nMeans were separated by the Tukey HSD test procedure at the threshold significant level\nof 5%. Pearson correlations between tissues\u2019 nutrient concentrations with palm age in\n12-to-238-month-old tenera were analyzed using JMP [\u00ae] Version 14 (SAS Institute Inc.,\nCary, NC, USA, 2021).\n\n\n**3.

Vegetative Biomass and Its Distribution_\n\nTotal vegetative biomass increased almost linearly from 1.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months\nold to 808.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old (Table 2). Trunk biomass alone increased from\n1.1 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 29 months after planting to 430.8 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old, while leaf\nbiomass, which is comprised of leaflets, rachis, and petiole increased from 1.0 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at\n12 months after planting to 223.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] after 133 months, with little increase thereafter.\nThe biomass of leaf bases increased substantially from 11.4 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 48 months old\nto 105.7 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 133 months old before declining to 90.4 and 59.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at\n209 and 238 months old, respectively. The bole was taken as the only belowground vegetative biomass in this study, while roots attached to the bole were excluded. Bole biomass\nincreased from 0.24 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 58.7 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] after 238 months of planting.\n\n\n**Table 2.** Dry weights (mean _\u00b1_ SE) of standing vegetative biomass of tenera oil palm sampled in Malaysia.\n\n\n\n**Palm**\n**Age ***\n\n\n\n**Vegetative Biomass (kg palm** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **)**\n\n\n**Leaflets** **Rachis** **Petiole** **Leaves** **Spear Leaves** - **Trunk** **Leaf Bases** **Bole** **Total**\n\n\n\n12 0.37 _\u00b1_ 0.05 e 0.24 _\u00b1_ 0.03 c 0.4 _\u00b1_ 0.1 c 1.0 _\u00b1_ 0.1 d 0.045 _\u00b1_ 0.005 d \u2013 \u2013 0.24 _\u00b1_ 0.01 c 1.3 _\u00b1_ 0.1 f\n\n29 3.2 _\u00b1_ 0.1 e 2.0 _\u00b1_ 0.1 c 5.1 _\u00b1_ 0.5 c 10.2 _\u00b1_ 0.7 d 0.35 _\u00b1_ 0.04 d 1.1 _\u00b1_ 0.1 e \u2013 0.57 _\u00b1_ 0.02 c 12.3 _\u00b1_ 0.7 f\n\n48 26.8 _\u00b1_ 0.2 d 21.1 _\u00b1_ 0.8 c 38.6 _\u00b1_ 1.9 b 87.6 _\u00b1_ 0.7 c 3.2 _\u00b1_ 0.1 cd 30.1 _\u00b1_ 0.2 de 11.4 _\u00b1_ 0.3 c 2.0 _\u00b1_ 0.04 c 134.0 _\u00b1_ 0.6 e\n\n88 49.4 _\u00b1_ 3.3 c 49.6 _\u00b1_ 5.6 b 54.0 _\u00b1_ 6.2 b 153.0 _\u00b1_ 14.8 b 6.0 _\u00b1_ 1.0 bcd 85.1 _\u00b1_ 4.8 d 72.7 _\u00b1_ 3.1 b 10.1 _\u00b1_ 1.1 bc 326.9 _\u00b1_ 16.9 d\n\n133 61.9 _\u00b1_ 2.3 b 75.5 _\u00b1_ 11.9 a 86.0 _\u00b1_ 8.9 a 223.3 _\u00b1_ 22.5 a 11.3 _\u00b1_ 1.5 ab 216.8 _\u00b1_ 7.7 c 105.7 _\u00b1_ 11.1 a 20.7 _\u00b1_ 2.5 b 577.9 _\u00b1_ 29.3 c\n\n209 72.7 _\u00b1_ 1.4 a 70.8 _\u00b1_ 1.5 ab 92.1 _\u00b1_ 4.7 a 235.5 _\u00b1_ 6.6 a 8.8 _\u00b1_ 0.6 abc 308.9 _\u00b1_ 3.0 b 90.4 _\u00b1_ 2.0 ab 21.1 _\u00b1_ 1.2 b 664.7 _\u00b1_ 7.5 b\n\n238 68.8 _\u00b1_ 3.5 ab 90.2 _\u00b1_ 6.4 a 87.3 _\u00b1_ 7.4 a 246.2 _\u00b1_ 12.4 a 13.3 _\u00b1_ 2.9 a 430.8 _\u00b1_ 34.3 a 59.6 _\u00b1_ 11.1 b 58.7 _\u00b1_ 7.0 a 808.6 _\u00b1_ 34.3 a\n\n\n                  - Months since nursery planting.

The proportion of accumulated biomass in leaves decreased with\nage, as the proportion of biomass in trunk increased. The contribution of leaf bases to total\nvegetative biomass appears substantial, especially from 88 to 209 months after planting.\nWithin the leaf biomass, leaflets and rachis contributed 30% each, while the petiole took up\nthe remaining 40%.\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 8 of 18\n\n\n**Figure 2.** Proportion of vegetative biomass of different ages of tenera oil palm.\n\n\n_3.2. Estimation of Dry-Matter Production_\n\n\nCumulative dry matter incorporated in tree parts was estimated through nonlinear\nregression (Table 3). The cumulative dry weights for spear leaves, trunk, and bole fitted well\nto modified exponential models. This method was highly satisfactory and gave accurate\nestimate of dry-matter production as R [2] of all the equations determined for most of the\nreplicates exceeded 0.90. Lower R [2] found in replicate 4 of DW spear and all replicates of\nDW bole was caused by outliers.\n\n\n**Table 3.** Equations to calculate the cumulative dry matter incorporated in spear leaves, trunk, and\nbole of tenera oil palm. The variable \u2018age\u2019 is the number of months since nursery planting and\nDW spear, DW trunk, and DW bole are dry weights (kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] ) accumulated in spear leaves, trunk, and\nbole, respectively, at the time of sampling.\n\n\n**Equation** **Replicate** _**a**_ _**b**_ **SE of Fits** **R** **[2]** _**p**_ **-Value**\n\n\n1 2.2826 _\u2212_ 417.6429 0.66 0.97 <0.01\nDW spear = exp\ufffda _\u2212_ ageb [1.5] \ufffd 23 2.49682.6945 _\u2212\u2212_ 497.2144439.7475 1.012.90 0.950.78 <0.01<0.01\n\n4 3.1698 _\u2212_ 825.2037 4.67 0.69 <0.05\n\n\n1 8.2456 _\u2212_ 33.6274 35.74 0.96 <0.01\nDW trunk = exp\ufffda _\u2212_ ageb [0.5] \ufffd 23 7.96978.9256 _\u2212\u2212_ 31.499542.5053 15.7149.53 0.990.94 <0.01<0.01\n\n4 7.6207 _\u2212_ 26.7059 21.30 0.98 <0.01\n\n\n1 8.5704 _\u2212_ 67.0073 13.85 0.76 <0.01\nDW bole = exp\ufffda _\u2212_ ageb [0.5] \ufffd 23 5.48916.3014 _\u2212\u2212_ 28.755836.5681 7.309.58 0.800.80 <0.01<0.01\n\n4 7.0320 _\u2212_ 45.4535 11.97 0.77 <0.01\n\n\n_3.3. Dry-Matter Production_\n\n\nWhole-palm dry-matter production increased with palm age but at a decreasing rate\n(Table 4). This was mainly attributed to the increasing amount of dry matter incorporated\nin vegetative tissue and fruit bunches during the first 133 months of growth. However, as\nthe amount of dry matter incorporated in leaves, trunk, roots, and fruit bunches started\nto stabilize at about 133 months onwards, the rate of whole-palm dry-matter production\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 9 of 18\n\n\ndecreased. The amounts of dry matter used for the spear leaves and bole were very small,\naveraging at 0.6 and 2.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1], respectively.\n\n\n**Table 4.** Dry matter (mean _\u00b1_ SE) incorporated in vegetative tissues (kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ) and fruit\nbunches of tenera oil palm.

Nutrients in Vegetative Tissues_\n\n\nThe concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B in the vegetative tissues of nursery,\nimmature and mature tenera palms are summarized in Table 5, while concentrations of\nthese nutrients in vegetative tissues for each palm age are provided in Tables S1 and S2. In\ngeneral, the concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B in vegetative tissues varied depending\non type of tissues, palm age, and nutrient elements. Nutrient concentrations between palms\nvaried considerably depending on palm age, nutrient element, and tissue types. For a\nwhole palm, the coefficient of variation for N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B concentrations could\nvary between 5.7 and 20.7%, 9.1 and 27.3%, 8.2 and 33.5%, 5.0 and 16.1%, 2.9 and 20.9%,\nand 2.8 and 19.2%, respectively.\nAmong the vegetative tissues, the cabbage, which comprises mainly meristemic cells,\nhad the highest concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B, while roots in general had\nthe lowest concentrations of these nutrients. The leaflets, which serve as photosynthetic\norgan had the second highest N concentration. The trunk, which is a storage organ, had\nhigher concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca after the cabbage and leaflets, except for Mg\nconcentration in the trunk of mature palms. Leaf bases, which are parts of the petiole that are\nattached to the trunk, had comparable concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca to the petiole.\nAveraged over the whole palm, the concentrations of N and Mg of 12-month-old\nnursery tenera were lower than in tenera of the same age studied previously (Table 6), but\nP concentration was comparable, and K and Ca concentrations were higher. For the whole\nimmature tenera, the concentrations of N and Mg were comparable to tenera studied by\nNg et al. [ 2 ] but P, K, and Ca concentrations were higher (Table 6). The concentrations of N,\nP, K, and Ca of mature tenera studied here were higher than previously studied dura and\ntenera except for Mg in mature dura (Table 6).\nK concentration in the leaves, trunk, and the whole palm did not change with palm age\nwhile concentrations of N, P, and Mg decreased with age (Table 7). On the other hand, Ca and\nB concentrations decreased with age in the trunk and the whole palm but not in the leaves.\n\n\n_3.5. Nutrients in Fresh Fruit Bunches_\n\n\nThe nutrient concentrations in fresh fruit bunches and their components are given in\nTable 8 .

Nutrient Demand_\n\n\nThe annual demand of N, P, Mg, Ca, and B for vegetative growth tended to follow\nannual vegetative dry-matter production (Figure 3; Table 4), with low demand during the\nfirst 12 months of growth. However, thereafter, nutrient demand increased rapidly up to\n88 months after nursery planting, and with slower increase thereafter up to month 209,\nbefore declining to a lower demand at month 238. Annual vegetative growth demand for K\nwas slightly different, as K demand declined sharply after peaking at month 88, and only\nreverted upward at month 238. Annual fruit-bunch demand for N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B\nclosely followed annual fruit-bunch production (Figure 3; Table 4), with a steady increase\nfrom 48 months after nursery planting, up to month 209 when fruit-bunch production\npeaked. Thereafter, nutrient demand declined following lower fruit-bunch production.\nAnnual total nutrient demand appeared to follow nutrient demand for vegetative growth,\nwith maximum nutrient demand occurring at month 209 when fruit bunch-production\nreached its peak\u2014except for K demand, which occurred at month 88, when vegetative\ngrowth demand for K peaked (Figure 3). At 12 months old, the total nutrient demand of\nthe tenera oil palm was 18 g N, 2.3 g P, 25 g K, 2.5 g Mg, 4.1 g Ca, and 0.01 g B per palm .\nHowever, its annual nutrient demand increased substantially to its maximum at 2.34 kg N,\n0.35 kg P, 4.36 kg K, 0.50 kg Mg, 1.14 kg Ca, and 3.0 g B per palm. These amounts of\nnutrients are sufficient to meet annual fruit-bunch production of 30 t ha _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 12 of 18\n\n\n**Figure 3.** Mean amounts of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B required to meet nutrient demand for vegetative\ngrowth and fruit-bunch production of tenera oil palm of different ages sampled in this study. Error\n\nbars are standard errors.\n\n\nDuring the entire duration of 238 months of palm growth, K was the most required\nnutrient, which accounted for about 54% of total nutrient demand, followed by N at about\n25%, while P, Mg, and Ca accounted for about 4, 6, and 12% of total nutrient demand,\nrespectively. Not surprisingly, as it is a micronutrient, B demand was the lowest, at about\n0.03%. Of the measured nutrients, between 37 and 54% of N, P, Mg, Ca, and B taken up by\nthe tenera palms across different ages was partitioned to fruit bunches; except for K, which\nwas lower (ranged between 19 and 36%) (Table 10).\n\n\n**Table 10.** Proportion of nutrients (mean _\u00b1_ SE) partitioned to fruit bunches in tenera oil palms of\ndifferent ages.

Discussion**\n\n_4.1. Standing Vegetative Biomass and Dry-Matter Production_\n\n\nThe aboveground dry weight of tenera palms measured in this study were comparable\nto previous studies on either dura or tenera palms grown on different soils and under\ndifferent management practices in Malaysia [ 16, 18, 34 ] and in Indonesia [ 35, 36 ] (Figure S2).\nOur results suggest that accumulation of aboveground vegetative biomass in oil palm tends\nto remain relatively constant across different types of planting materials and environments.\nHowever, clear differences in aboveground vegetative biomass accumulation were observed\non palms grown under suboptimal conditions such as peat in Malaysia [ 37 ] and in West\nAfrica [ 15, 38 ]. The poor growing conditions of peat [ 39, 40 ] and marked dry seasons\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 13 of 18\n\n\nprevailing in West Africa [ 41 ] would have detrimentally affected the growth of the sampled\npalms there; hence, they accumulated less aboveground vegetative biomass.\nThe rapid increase in dry-matter production during the first 88 months of planting is typical of oil palm and is consistent with previous studies [ 2, 16 ]. Production of\naboveground vegetative dry matter in mature palms was in close agreement with studies conducted in Malaysia [ 2, 16 ] but was much higher than in oil palms studied in West\nAfrica [ 15, 38 ] (Table S3). Seasonal drought (6 consecutive months with monthly mean\nrainfall of less than 100 mm per month _[\u2212]_ [1] ) [ 11 ] in West Africa would have affected the rate\nof leaf production and expansion [ 36, 42 ], and in turn resulted in lower leaf dry-matter\nproduction. Ng et al. [ 2 ], on the other hand, might have underestimated leaf dry-matter\nproduction by only considering 18 pruned leaves with average leaf dry weight of 3.95 kg\nwhile overestimating trunk dry-matter production by including leaf bases as part of the trunk.\nIf root dry-matter production is considered, the total vegetative dry-matter production\nestimated in this study agreed with Dufrene\u2019s estimation [ 38 ] of 171.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1],\nbut this was about 25% higher than Corley et al. [ 16 ] and 75% higher than Rees and\nTinker [ 15 ]. Dufrene [ 38 ] and this study estimated annual root dry-matter production,\nbut the other studies only considered net increase in root dry weight, and this perhaps\nexplains the observed differences. If Equation (4), which was developed in Malaysia, was\nused to estimate the root dry-matter production in Corley et al. [ 16 ], then total vegetative\ndry-matter production would be increased to 144.7 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1], quite close to the\npresent estimate of 168.2 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] (Table S3). It is thus obvious that production\nof vegetative dry matter could be quite similar across different environments, but the\npartitioning of above- and belowground vegetative dry matter might vary depending on\nthe prevailing growing conditions. Dufrene [ 38 ] showed that oil palm tends to partition\nmore dry matter to roots in places with pronounced dry seasons. In this study, the root\ndry-matter production was estimated using Equation (4) developed in Malaysia [ 31 ]. The\nestimated root dry-matter production only represents about 10.4% of total aboveground\nvegetative dry-matter production. This is a considerably small fraction of dry matter\npartitioned to the roots as argued by Corley and Tinker [ 11 ] (pp. 341\u2013342). Thus, it\nseems that further studies are required to ascertain root dry-matter production of tenera\npalms at different ages of growth, since this has important implication on total dry-matter\nproduction, partitioning, and vegetative growth demand for nutrients.\nBunch dry matter produced in this study was comparable to the amounts produced\nelsewhere in Malaysia but was 1.6 to 2 times more than those in West Africa (Table S3).\nThis is not unexpected, as dry-matter requirements for vegetative growth appear to be met\nfirst before any surplus dry matter is diverted to bunch production. This surplus is smaller\nin less-conducive environments like West Africa, where a marked dry season prevails.\nConsequently, total dry-matter production across different environments might not vary as\nsubstantially as highlighted here. Total dry-matter production found in this study was only\n15% more than Dufrene [38], despite having produced 61% more bunch dry matter.\n\n\n_4.2. Nutrient Concentrations and Nutrient Demand_\n\n\nThe variations in nutrient concentrations among vegetative tissues found in this study\nwere consistent with previous studies [ 2, 4, 5, 17, 18, 21, 43 ]. These results confirm that the\nuptake of nutrients cannot be reliably deduced from leaf nutrient analysis alone [ 43 ], as\nhigh concentrations of nutrients are also found in other vegetative tissues such as rachis,\npetiole, leaf bases, and trunk. Classical fertilizer recommendation methodology based\nsolely on leaf nutrient analysis data must consider the variations in nutrient concentrations\namong vegetative tissues. Considerable palm-to-palm variations in nutrient concentrations\nmight be attributed to genetic differences, since tenera palms planted at the study site came\nfrom different genetic origins. It has been shown that nutrient uptake could vary by up\nto 30\u201340% among oil-palm planting materials [ 43 ]. It is also possible that the variations\nobserved were caused by genetic\u2013environmental interactions. We therefore recommend\nestablishing plantations with blocks of homogenous oil-palm planting materials in order to\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 14 of 18\n\n\nobtain a more reliable estimate of fertilizer requirements. In the case of existing plantations\nwith mixed oil-palm planting materials, an appropriate sampling size should be established\nfor every management block so as to minimize variation.\nMuch higher nutrient concentrations found in the cabbage were expected and have\nbeen documented [ 2, 21 ]. This plant part is the growing point of the palm, so it is not\nsurprising to observe a much higher concentration of nutrients here, as more nutrients\nare required to grow developing tissues, such as immature leaves and leaf bases. Higher\nK concentrations found in all vegetative tissues, particularly in the trunk, agreed with\nprevious findings [ 2, 18, 43, 44 ], and confirmed its prominent role in the nutrition of oil palm.\nThe high concentrations of nutrients found in the leaf bases highlight the importance of\nthis plant part as nutrient sink and stock, and it should be given due attention since it\nconstitutes a significant portion of vegetative biomass (Table 2). The amounts of nutrients\nimmobilized by leaf bases and recycled back to the soil through shedding of leaf bases\ncould be significant [ 45 ]. The low nutrient concentrations found in the roots have been\nreported [2,4,5,21].\nThe higher concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca found in the whole immature and\nmature tenera studied here (Table 6), suggest that the tenera studied here might require\nmore N, P, K, Mg, and Ca to sustain vegetative growth for a same unit of biomass produced.\nRecent advances in agronomic practices might have improved the uptake of nutrients, and\nled to the observed higher concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca. It is also possible that\nthe presently studied tenera had higher nutrient concentrations in its vegetative tissues\nintrinsically as a result of advances in oil-palm breeding [43].\nThe decline in concentrations of N and P with age, particularly in the trunk, has been\nreported [ 2 ]. Henson and Chang [ 46 ] analyzed published nutrient concentration data and\nfound that only concentrations of N and P in the trunk declined with age, while N, P,\nand K concentrations in other palm tissues did not. The present study confirmed their\nfindings but also found that concentrations of N and P in the leaves, concentration of Mg\nin the leaves and trunk, and concentrations of Ca and B in the trunk declined with age\n(Table 7). The ability of oil palm to store K in vegetative tissues might explain the lack of\ncorrelation between K concentration and palm age [ 18, 44 ]. This is supported by higher K\nconcentrations found in the vegetative tissues such as rachis, petiole, leaf bases, trunk, and\nbole (Table 5). If whole-palm nutrient concentration is considered, only K concentration\ndid not decline with age (Table 7). The physiological mechanism underlying the decline\nin concentration of nutrients in plant tissues with plant or organ age is complex and has\nnot been fully understood [ 47 ]. One plausible explanation is that as the plant grows and\naccumulates more biomass, the increase in plant or organ biomass is greater than the\ncorresponding increase in nutrient content. This eventually decreases the concentration of\nnutrients due to the dilution effect of biomass [ 47, 48 ]. Trunk K behaved quite differently\nin relation to palm age. It tended to increase with palm age initially before declining to\na more stable level (Figure S3). Ng et al. [ 2 ] observed a similar trend of K concentration\nin the trunk (Figure S3). They argued that oil palm tends to build up a K reserve in the\ntrunk during the early years of planting, but this reserve will deplete gradually soon after\nfruit-bunch production peaks. The present observation seems to agree with Ng et al. [ 2 ] as K\nconcentration in the trunk tended to decrease with increasing fruit-bunch yield in both studies.\nThe variations in nutrient concentrations among bunch components found in this\nstudy were consistent with previous studies [ 6, 19 \u2013 21, 33 ]. The most striking variation is the\nnutrient concentrations in the mesocarp. The tenera bunches studied here had much higher\nN, P, K, Mg, and Ca concentrations in their mesocarps than previously studied dura and\ntenera bunches (Table 8). Consequently, the tenera bunches studied here contain higher N,\nP, K, Mg, and Ca contents than previously studied dura and tenera bunches (Table 9). It is\nthus obvious that for the same production level of fruit bunches, the tenera studied here\nwould require more nutrients to support fruit-bunch production.\nThe rapid increase in nutrient demand in the first 88 months since nursery planting\nwas mainly driven by growth rate (Table 4), consistent with Ng et al. [ 2 ] and Goh et al. [ 21 ],\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 15 of 18\n\n\nand also suggests that derivation of nutrient requirements from palms of one age or\nfrom mature palms alone appears inadequate. Higher demand of N, P, Mg, Ca, and B at\nmonth 209 was attributed to high demand of these nutrients for fruit-bunch production\n( Figure 3; Table 4 ). The decline in K demand for vegetative growth after month 88 was\nconsistent with the decline in trunk K concentration (Figures 3 and S3). It appears that the\nstudied tenera did not increase its K uptake when fruit-bunch demand for K increased due\nto increasing fruit-bunch production but instead used K reserved in the vegetative tissues,\nparticularly trunk K, to meet fruit-bunch production. Thus, it is important to build up K\nreserves during the early years of planting to meet increased K demand in later years. Teoh\nand Chew [ 18 ] estimated that trunk K reserve of fully fertilized tenera palms could support\nvegetative growth and fruit-bunch production for 2 to 6 years.\nThe substantial amounts of nutrients required annually by the tenera studied here reemphasize the large fertilizer needs of oil palm and the importance of judicious manuring\nthat meets agronomic, economic, and environmental objectives. The amounts of nutrients\ndepicted in Figure 3 were regarded as gross nutrient demand [ 2, 11 ] since nutrients recycled\nfrom pruned leaves were not considered. If annual fruit-bunch production of 25 t ha _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nis considered, the annual gross nutrient demand of mature tenera studied here would\nbe 1.99 kg N, 0.28 kg P, 3.94 kg K, 0.42 kg Mg, and 0.99 kg Ca palm _[\u2212]_ [1] which is about\n53, 57, 132, and 64% more N, P, K, and Ca than found in the dura studied by Ng et al. [ 2 ],\nrespectively, but Mg demand was only 2% higher than in the dura. No difference was\nfound when annual B demand was compared with another mature tenera [ 21 ], as both\nrequired 2.5 g palm _[\u2212]_ [1] .\nHowever, if nutrients contained in the pruned leaves were all recycled, the annual\nnet demand of nutrients would be 1.04 kg N, 0.16 kg P, 1.85 kg K, 0.26 kg Mg, 0.47 kg Ca,\nand 1.3 g B palm _[\u2212]_ [1] . These amounts were higher than net nutrient demand of fully fertilized mature dura [ 2 ] and tenera [ 18 ] studied previously. Teoh and Chew [ 18 ] found\nthat fully fertilized mature tenera grown on different soils in Malaysia required 1.34 to\n1.59 kg K palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] if K recycled from pruned leaves was considered. The higher\nnutrient demand is not unexpected because of higher nutrient concentrations found in\nthe vegetative tissues and fruit bunches of tenera studied here, and given that dry-matter\nproduction of either dura or tenera planting materials could be quite similar, especially\nwhen they are grown under favorable environments (Table S3). Therefore, for the same\nlevel of dry-matter production, the tenera studied here would need more nutrients.\nFruit bunches accounted for the largest portion of required N, P, Mg, Ca, and B, except\nin the case of K (Table 9), because a large portion of K is stored in vegetative tissues such\nas leaves, trunk, and leaf bases (Table 6). Goh et al. [ 44 ] found that fully fertilized mature\ntenera grown on different soils in Malaysia partitioned 70\u201373% of their K demand to\nvegetative tissues, whereas unfertilized tenera partitioned 55\u201370%. Thus, from the fertilizer\nmanagement context, the production level of fruit bunches has great influence on the\ndetermination of fertilizer requirements of oil palm.\n\n\n_4.3. Implications on Fertilizer Requirements of Oil Palm_\n\n\nThe tenera studied here has been fertilized following standard commercial fertilizer\nregimes that are commonly practiced in the palm-oil industry in Malaysia (Table 1). The\nvegetative dry matter and fruit-bunch production of this tenera was comparable to fully\nfertilized tenera studied in Malaysia [ 4, 5, 16 ], suggesting that the tenera studied here must\nbe growing at its potential. The tenera were neither deficient nor luxuriant in nutrient\ncontent since the net amounts of nutrients required for vegetative growth and fruit-bunch\nproduction closely matched the applied fertilizer quantities after accounting for losses\nto the environments [ 49, 50 ] (Table S4). The small deficit of about 46 kg N, 54 kg K, and\n11 kg Mg per hectare per year could be easily supplied by Harimau Series soil (Typic\nPaleudult). Soils in Malaysia could supply 90 to 194 kg N and 62 to 189 kg K per hectare\nper year [ 4, 44 ]. Therefore, the growth demand for nutrients determined in this study could\nserve as the potential nutrient demand of tenera oil palm grown under current agronomic\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 16 of 18\n\n\npractices in Malaysia, and perhaps elsewhere. The nutrient demand data obtained here can\nbe used together with soil and foliar nutrient analysis data to further refine the fertilizer\nrequirements for tenera oil palm grown on different soil types.\n\n\n**5. Conclusions**\n\n\nThe present study closes a significant gap in the nutrient management of tenera oil\npalm grown under current agronomic practices, by determining its nutrient demand at\ndifferent ages of growth.\nAlthough the dry-matter production of commercially grown tenera has not increased\nover the years, its N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B concentrations in vegetative tissues and fruit\nbunches were found to be higher. This has led to higher demand of these nutrients, which\nshould be given due attention when formulating fertilizer requirements for tenera grown\nunder current agronomic practices. The present findings provide an opportunity to match\nthe nutrient demand of tenera at different ages of growth. This allows more sustainable\nproduction of palm oil that meets agronomic, economic and environmental objectives.\nImportant findings of this study are summarized below.\n\n\n(1) Excluding roots, the total standing vegetative biomass increased almost linearly from\n1.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 808.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old.\n(2) Whole palm dry-matter production increased with palm age but at a decreasing\nrate, from 1.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 285.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] after\n133 months, with little increase thereafter.\n(3) Nutrient concentrations in vegetative tissues varied considerably depending on palm\nage, nutrient element, and tissue types. The tenera studied here generally had higher\nnutrient concentrations in the vegetative tissues and fruit bunches than previously\nstudied dura and tenera.\n\n(4) The maximum N, P, Mg, Ca, and B demand occurred at month 209 during peak\nproduction of fruit bunches, while maximum K demand occurred at 88 months after\nnursery planting, when vegetative growth demand for K peaked.\n(5) Tenera bunches studied here contain 4.74 kg N, 0.79 kg P, 6.35 kg K, 1.31 kg Mg,\n2.30 kg Ca, and 5.9 g B per tonne of fresh fruit bunches.\n(6) Total amounts of nutrients required to produce 25 t fresh fruit bunches ha _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nwere 1.99 kg N, 0.28 kg P, 3.94 kg K, 0.42 kg Mg, 0.99 kg Ca, and 2.5 g B palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n(7) If all leaves produced in a year were pruned off and all its nutrients were recycled, the\nnet amounts of nutrients required to produce 25 t fresh fruit bunches ha _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] would\nbe 1.04 kg N, 0.16 kg P, 1.85 kg K, 0.26 kg Mg, 0.47 kg Ca, and 1.3 g B palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n\n\n**Supplementary Materials:** [The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/agronomy12020426/s1)\n[10.3390/agronomy12020426/s1, Figure S1: Leaf production rate of tenera oil palm grown under](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/agronomy12020426/s1)\nMalaysian inland environment, Figure S2: Aboveground vegetative biomass of oil palm as quantified\nin this study and previous studies, Figure S3: Trunk K concentration in relation to palm age and\nfruit bunch yield in Ng et al.
