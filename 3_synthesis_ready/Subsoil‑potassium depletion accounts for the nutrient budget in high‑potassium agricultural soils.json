Correndo** **1** - **, Gerardo Rubio** **2** **, Fernando O. Garc\u00eda** **3** **& Ignacio A. Ciampitti** **1** \n\n**Continuous potassium (K) removal without replenishment is progressively mining Argentinean soils.**\n**Our goals were to evaluate the sensitivity of soil-K to K budgets, quantify soil-K changes over time**\n**along the soil profile, and identify soil variables that regulate soil-K depletion. Four on-farm trials**\n**under two crop rotations including maize, wheat and soybean were evaluated. Three treatments**\n**were compared: (1) control (no fertilizer applied); (2) application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur**\n**fertilizers -NPS-; and (3) pristine condition. After nine years, crops removed from 258 to 556 kg K \u00adha** **[\u22121]** **.**\n**Only two sites showed a decline in the exchangeable-K levels at 0\u201320 cm but unrelated to K budget.**\n**Topsoil exchangeable-K levels under agriculture resulted 48% lower than their pristine conditions,**\n**although still above response levels. Both soil exchangeable-K and slowly-exchangeable K vertical**\n**distribution patterns (0\u2013100 cm) displayed substantial depletion relative to pristine conditions, mainly**\n**concentrated at subsoil (20\u2013100 cm), with 55\u201383% for exchangeable-K, and 74\u201395% for slowly-**\n**exchangeable-K. Higher pristine levels of exchangeable-K and slowly-exchangeable-K and lower clay**\n**and silt contents resulted in higher soil-K depletion. Soil K management guidelines should consider**\n**both topsoil and subsoil nutrient status and variables related to soil K buffer capacity.**\n\n\nPotassium (K) is an essential macronutrient required by crops, which exhibit a broad range of K requirements\n(40\u2013300 kg \u00adha [\u22121] \u00adyear [\u22121] ) and K removal from the harvested \u00adproduct [1] . Wheat ( _Triticum aestivum_ L.) and maize\n( _Zea mays_ L.) crops export around 3 kg K \u00adMg [\u22121], whereas soybean ( _Glycine max_ L.) exports 16 kg K \u00adMg [\u22121][2][\u2013][4] .\nThe main source of plant K is the soil, where K is distributed in four different pools: (1) soil solution K, (2)\nexchangeable K \u00ad(NH 4 -OAc-K), (3) slowly exchangeable K \u00ad(NaBPh 4 -K), and (4) K-bearing primary \u00adminerals [5][\u2013][7] .\nThe soil solution-K and NH4-OAc-K fractions are the most readily available K source to plants. Thus, fertilizer\nrecommendations are mostly based on these \u00adfractions [8] . The NaBPh4-K pool includes less available K fractions\nalbeit has received more attention for diagnosing K fertilization needs during the last \u00addecades [9][\u2013][11] . Finally, the\nmineral-K is a recalcitrant soil K fraction, usually not considered for K diagnosing purposes.\nPotassium can be acquired from all soil layers explored by plant roots, depending on the crop species and\non vertical distribution of plant available \u00adK [12] . Although root mass is concentrated at topsoil, maize root mass\nwas reported as poorly correlated with root activity, which can remain high until 60 cm \u00addepth [13] . Spring cereals\nmight take up to 80% of the K from the 0\u201325 cm \u00adlayer [14], while soybeans may take about to 60% of the K from\nthe 0\u201330 cm \u00adlayer [15] .\nStudies at a global scale indicate that the stratification towards the topsoil is less marked for K than for other\nmajor nutrients such as phosphorus and \u00adnitrogen [16] . Thus, only a portion of the soil K available for plants is\ncaptured if soil samples are collected from the topsoil (i.e. 0\u201320 cm depth) [17] . This underestimation is reduced\nin those soils with a high topsoil K \u00adstratification [14] . Stratification normally occurs when K fertilizer is applied in\nthe \u00adtopsoil [18], as well as when roots uptake K from deeper soil layers and residues are deposited in the \u00adtopsoil [16] .\nThis process is enhanced in fertilized and high-yielding systems, involving a high deposition of plant residues\nsuch as in no-tillage \u00adsystems [19] .\nMost agricultural soils of the Argentine Pampas are characterized by high native soil K linked to the clay\nmineralogy (predominantly illite) of the parental \u00admaterial [20] . Positive yield responses to K fertilization have been\nrarely observed in the region so far; thus, fertilizer K applications have been negligible during the Argentinean\nagricultural era, which started around 100 years ago. However, continuous K removal via harvest is gradually\n\n\n1 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University, 3031 Throckmorton Plant Sciences Center, Manhattan,\nKS 66506, USA.

Under comparable negative K budgets in Pampean soils, greater \u00adNH 4 -OAc reductions (46% vs. 8%) at the topsoil were found in soils with high- (900 mg \u00adkg [\u22121] ) relative to low-initial (600 mg \u00adkg [\u22121] )\n\u00adNH 4 -OAc-K \u00adlevels [22] . However, most of Pampean soils are still above the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K critical level (about\n130\u2013170 mg K \u00adkg [\u22121] ) [21] .\nThe aim of this study was to quantify the effect of contrasting K removal on soil K fractions along the soil\nprofile. We hypothesize that: (1) in high native K soils, the topsoil (0\u201320 cm) \u00adNH 4 -OAc test is not sensitive to\nidentify short-medium term K depletion trends; (2) vertical distribution patterns of both \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and\n\u00adNaBPh 4 -K are affected by the agricultural footprint, with a significant depletion expected to occur beyond the\ntopsoil (0\u201320 cm); and (3) soil K deviates from the Pristine conditions depending on soil factors related to K\nbuffer capacity such as soil texture and indigenous richness of soil K, with more depletion expected to occur for\nboth K fractions with coarser textures and high pristine soil K levels.\n\n\n**Results**\n**Cumulative K budget.** Cumulative K budget reflects continuous K removal, without K fertilization. The\nhigh-yielding system, NPS treatment (Fig. 1), significantly increased K removal, with an average annual K\nremoval ranging from \u2212 29 to \u2212 62 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] \u00adyear [\u22121] . After more than 10 harvests, the cumulative K budget\nfor the Control varied from \u2212 258 to \u2212 421 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] and for the NPS ranged from \u2212 467 to \u2212 556 kg K \u00adha [\u22121]\n(Fig. 1). San Alfredo, La Blanca and La Hansa sites presented comparable K removal on Control plots (\u2212 330\nto \u2212 421 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] ), whereas Balducchi exhibited lower K removal (\u2212 258 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] ). Cumulative removal at the\nNPS resulted similar across sites (\u2212 467 to \u2212 556 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] ). Differences in K removal are largely explained by\nfinal yields, with lower yield for the Control in Balducchi but with similar yield for the NPS relative to the other\nsites (average 1.9 vs. 3.2 Mg \u00adha [\u22121], with larger yield gap for Control and NPS, respectively).\n\n\n**Topsoil \u00adNH** **4** **\u2011OAc\u2011K changes.** The evolution of \u00adNH 4 -Oac-K in the topsoil (0\u201320 cm) was site-specific\n(Fig. 1). The sites with longest agricultural history at the beginning of the experiment (Balducchi and La Hansa),\npresented significant \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K reductions from 2000 to 2009. The opposite occurred in those sites with\nshorter farming history at the beginning of the experiment (< 10 year: San Alfredo and La Blanca), with no differences between initial and final NH4-OAc-K levels. Surprisingly, no differences were detected between Control\nand NPS in any case (Fig. 1, Table 2). Thus, the lack of change or negligible reductions in topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K\nover cropping seasons did not correspond with the increasingly negative K budgets.\n\n\n**Vertical distribution patterns of soil \u00adKNH** **4** **\u2011OAcK.** The \u00adNH 4 -OAcK fraction was predominantly\nlocated (range 72\u201386%) in the subsoil (20\u2013100 cm) with significant differences between sites and treatments\n(Table 2). Under the Pristine conditions, the distribution in depth showed notorious differences among the\nfour sites (green circles; Fig. 2). The most contrasting soils were Balducchi and San Alfredo, portraying greater\n\u00adNH 4 -OAc-K towards the subsoil and topsoil, respectively. La Blanca and La Hansa sites presented a fairly similar\nPristine \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K pattern, following a sinuous trajectory with minimum levels at 20\u201340 cm, and rather comparable values at shallower and deeper layers. Interestingly, observed differences among soils were not reflected\nin the average \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K stocks (0\u2013100 cm), that were rather equivalent (1359, 1055, 1228, and 1284 g \u00adm [\u22122] for\nBalducchi, San Alfredo, La Blanca and La Hansa, respectively).\nA remarkable effect of agriculture was reflected in a considerable decrease in the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K levels for the\nControl and NPS relative to their Pristine condition (Table 2; Fig. 2) although its vertical distribution varied\ndepending on the location (Fig. 2). At all locations, significant interactions between treatment and soil depth\nwere documented (Supplementary material 1, Appendix A). Balducchi and La Blanca (Hapludolls), showed the\nhigher \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K depletion rates (averaging 63 and 37%; respectively), which was exacerbated towards the\nsubsoil (60\u2013100 cm). Contrastingly, in San Alfredo and La Hansa (Argiudolls), \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K reductions due to\nagriculture were lower (average 25 and 27%, respectively) and occurred mainly towards the topsoil (Table 2).\nDifferences in \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K between the Control and NPS showed a lower magnitude than relative for the difference of those treatments to the Pristine due to differences in time-spans (Cropping history, Table 1).\n\n\n**NaBPh** **4** **\u2011K.** Similarly to \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K, the slowly-exchangeable fraction \u00ad(NaBPh 4 -K) was found predominantly in the subsoil (20\u2013100 cm) (range 78\u201381%), without large differences between sites or treatments\n(Table 2). The \u00adNaBPh 4 -K contents were 2.1 times in average (range 1.2\u00d7\u20136.2\u00d7) larger than the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K.\nTreatment by soil depth interaction was significant (p < 0.05) at Balducchi and La Blanca, while main effects\nof treatment (p = 0.05) and soil depth (p < 0.05) were significant at La Hansa, and only soil depth resulted in a\nmarginally significant effect (p = 0.11) at San Alfredo (Fig. 3) (Supplementary material 1, Appendix A). Balducchi showed the larger impact of agriculture on their \u00adNaBPh 4 -K levels (average 41% depletion as compared to the\nPristine scenario), whereas the other sites varied in a rather small range (5\u201317%).\n\n\n**Soil K depletion drivers.** The \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K depletion patterns followed a close association with the Pristine- \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and clay content of each soil layer (Fig. 4). For the Pristine- \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K, the greater the native\nK values, the larger was the documented depletion K rate. On the other hand, increases in soil clay (%) levels\nwere associated with lower depletion \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K rate until reaching a threshold about 33% of clay, remaining\nat a minimum level for \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K depletion with high clay content. Conversely, for \u00adNaBPh 4 -K depletion, the\nmost relevant factor resulted the silt content (%), showing a depletion trend until reaching a threshold of 50%\nof silt, above of which the \u00adNaBPh 4 -K depletion becomes minimum. A relatively weak but positive association\nto Pristine-NaBPh 4 -K content was also observed, however; it resulted less relevant than for the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K\ndepletion.\n\n\n\n**Scientific Reports** |    (2021) 11:11597 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90297-1\n\n\nVol:.(1234567890)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\n\n**Figure 1.** Grain yield, cumulative K removal by grain (K budget), and \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K at 0\u201320 cm for check\ntreatment with no fertilizers added (Control) and fertilized plots with N, P and S (NPS) for each experimental\nsite under two different cropping sequences (Table 1) from 2000 to 2009. Each observation is the average of\nthree replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation for grain yields, and standard errors from their\nrespective analyses of variance for cumulative K budget and topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K (Tukey\u2019s HSD, _p_ < 0.05).

These results support our first hypothesis,\nwhich stated that \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K is not highly sensitive at identifying K depletion in these high native K soils. In\nfact, after nine years of cropping with negative K budgets, only two out of the four sites showed changes in this\ntopsoil K fraction. These two locations (Balducchi and La Hansa) are both characterized by presenting the longest continuous cropping-history, which may have led to greater reductions not only in terms of measured soil K\nfractions but also related to total soil K. Unfortunately, no historical yield data was available to further explore\nhypotheses related to the effect of cropping history. Nonetheless, these results would indicate that continuous\n\n\n\n**Scientific Reports** |    (2021) 11:11597 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90297-1\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\n\n**Figure 2.** Soil profiles of \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K (g \u00adm [\u22122] ) under three different conditions: pristine soils (green circles),\nunder grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with no fertilizers added (Control, orange triangles), and under\ngrain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with N, P, plus S fertilization (NPS, purple diamonds). Overlapping error\nbars indicate absence of significant differences between scenarios by soil depths combinations (Tukey\u2019s HSD,\n_p_ < 0.05).\n\n\nK removal after nine years of farming has come from extra K-pools (e.g., non-exchangeable-K, root K uplift)\nrather than the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K at top-soil.\nIn line with recent surveys performed in the Pampean \u00adRegion [21], our four soils remained high in K fertility\nalong the experimental period, as reflected by topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K values above the critical level. Considering an\naverage annual K removal of 62 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] (average yields for the studied crop rotation), a soil should lose about\n15 mg \u00adkg [\u22121] of soil K a year. If all the K budget is reflected on the NH4-OAc-K at topsoil, the critical range could\nbe reached in between 6 (Balducchi) to 224 years (La Blanca). Nonetheless, observed variability is in line with\nSimonsson et al. [23], who reported that, besides the K budget, the soil K depletion results from the interaction of\nmultiple factors such as cropping history, soil texture and mineralogy and potential subsoil K supply. Additionally, our data reveals that the subsoil \u00adNH 4 OAc-K levels are decreasing but still high.\nRegarding our second hypothesis, we found evidence to support that K depletion occurs mainly beyond the\ntopsoil. Both soil exchangeable and slowly-exchangeable K vertical distribution patterns displayed large depletion\nrelative to the Pristine scenario in the whole soil profile (0\u2013100 cm). However, depletion of both fractions was\nmore pronounced at subsoil (20\u2013100 cm) (55\u201383% for \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and 74\u201395% for \u00adNaBPh 4 -K) rather than in\nthe usually tested 0\u201320 cm soil layer. It is known that plants can remobilize K from the subsoil towards shallow\n\u00adlayers [16][,][24][,][25], and this effect would be exacerbated under minimum or no-tillage management where the stover\nmay release significant amounts of soluble K that later has low mobility into the soil \u00admatrix [19][,][26] . Thus, our results\nhighlight the relevance of subsoil on the K supply for \u00adcrops [27] and thus, of building awareness about soil K profile\n\u00adconcentrations [28] . For practical reasons, most of soil K recommendation systems are based on topsoil data without\nconsidering the subsoil\u2014e.g _._ 0\u201315 cm in the US Corn Belt, where also Mollisols is the dominant soil \u00adorder [29] .\nHowever, our results are consistent with a K recommendation system based on the combined \u00adNH 4 -OAc information from both the topsoil and the subsoil such as former system in \u00adIowa [29] and recommendations in \u00adIndia [30] .\nLastly, obtained results fully support our third hypothesis, since the two main factors affecting K depletion\nrates were the pristine K levels and the soil texture (reflected as clay and silt content).

Thus, an increased soil K buffer capacity could mask the effects of continuous K removal.\nIn other soils, negative K budgets were reflected not only in \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K but also in changes in more stable and\nrecalcitrant soil K \u00adfractions [9][,][11][,][24][,][37][,][39] . Finally, our results also indicate that the root K uplift process was accentuated at locations without fine-textured horizons (Balducchi and La Blanca). Thus, soil layers with greater clay\ncontent involve not only a high buffer capacity but may also denote a mechanical impedance to root \u00adgrowth [40],\n\n.\nultimately affecting K uptake and \u00adremoval [41]\nThis research offers an indication that topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K interacts with subsoil K and other soil K pools as\na K source for satisfying plant nutrient demand. Yet, it is worth acknowledging the need of more comprehensive\nstudies on soil-K depletion trends in response to different crop management practices for the Pampean Mollisols.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\nThe high indigenous-K fertility of Pampean Mollisols is progressively being depleted due to the prolonged and\nintensive agricultural use without K replenishment, thereby rendering them to express responsiveness to K in a\nnear future. Continuous K removal by crop harvest without K replenishment led to soil K depletion primarily\nconcentrated in the subsoil. In such sense, the single use of topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K in high native K soils could result\nin an incomplete assessment of soil K fertility diagnosis. Instead, both topsoil and subsoil K analyses could be\ncomplemented to develop more precise guidelines on medium-to-long-term K fertilizer needs. Also, as soil K\ndepletion increased with indigenous K level and decreased with finer soil texture, including them as key metadata\nwill contribute for an improved development of soil K guidelines.\n\n\n**Methods**\n**Experimental sites.** The Pampas region is located in the East-Central region of Argentina.

Maize and wheat are usually fertilized with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) but at rates below nutrient removal, resulting in negative \u00adbudgets [43] .\nIn 2000, a long-term fertilization network was established at farms from the southern Santa Fe region of\n_Consorcios Rurales de Experimentaci\u00f3n Agr\u00edcola_ (CREA), located in the Central Pampas of \u00adArgentina [31][,][44][,][45] . Four\nsites from the network, differing in soil properties and management history, were selected for this study (Table 1).\nTwo sites were under maize\u2013double-cropped wheat/soybean (M-W/S) rotation\u2014Balducchi (34\u00b0 9\u2032 26.0\u2033 S, 61\u00b0\n36\u2032 33.8\u2033 W) and San Alfredo (33\u00b0 53\u2032 14.1\u2033 S, 61\u00b0 27\u2032 30.5\u2033 W), and two sites were under maize-full-season\nsoybean-double-cropped wheat/soybean (M-S-W/S) rotation-La Blanca (33\u00b0 29\u2032 57.2\u2033 S, 62\u00b0 37\u2032 55.3\u2033 W) and\nLa Hansa (32\u00b0 23\u2032 04.2\u2033 S, 61\u00b0 11\u2032 58.8\u2033 W).\n\n\n**Design and measurements.** The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with three\nreplicates. Plot size was 25\u201330 m wide and 65\u201370 m long. Two contrasting fertilizer treatments were evaluated:\n(1) control, without fertilization, (2) the recommended nutrient management, including the three most deficient\nnutrients in the region\u2014N, P, and S (NPS). Additionally, adjacent soils to experimental plots with no antecedents\nof agriculture were evaluated as pristine soil conditions (Pristine). For the NPS treatment, N and S were applied\nat rates based on crop demand, ranged from 90 to 175 kg N \u00adyear [\u22121] and from 17 to 25 kg S \u00adyear [\u22121], P rates were\ndecided each season before planting according to the attainable yield and P removal, averaging 37 kg P \u00adyear [\u22121] .\nNitrogen fertilizer was not added to soybean. All nutrients were applied before or at planting using solid fertilizer blends. The source of N was urea (46% N), for P was mono-ammonium phosphate (23% P), and for S was\ncalcium sulfate (19% S).\nFor all treatments, crop residues were not removed or grazed and negligible K losses from leaching and/or\nrunoff were assumed. Annual budgets were estimated from crop grain yield and grain K concentrations data.\nNo differences in grain K content between Control and NPS treatments were observed during the first years\n(2000\u20132002), and no grain-K measurements were made for the 2003\u20132009 period. For grain crops, provided\ncrops evidence of K sufficiency, seed K contents are highly conserved that other management practices impacting\nyields are often inconsequential for grain K \u00adconcentration [46][\u2013][49] . Therefore, average values (2000\u20132002) of 4.0, 5.7\nand 19.0 g K \u00adkg [\u22121] grain for maize, wheat and soybean, respectively, were assumed to be constant for K removal\ncalculations. Those values are in range with previously published data for \u00admaize [2], \u00adwheat [3], and \u00adsoybean [4][,][50] .\nSoil samples were collected at early spring in 2000, 2004 (0\u201320 cm) and 2009 (0\u2013100 cm, see below) for all\ntreatments. Soil properties related to total organic C, soil-test \u00adP [51], soil \u00adpH [52] (1:2.5 soil:water), bulk \u00addensity [53], and\nsecondary \u00adelements [54][,][55] were determined at the onset of the trial (2000). Soil extractable-K was determined by\nthe pH 7 buffered 1.0 M ammonium-acetate method \u00ad(NH 4 -OAc-K) [56] . Soil texture was measured also at the onset\nof the trial at topsoil (0\u201320 cm) and the rest of the soil layers (20\u2013100 cm) were obtained from the Soil Survey\n\n\n\n**Scientific Reports** |    (2021) 11:11597 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90297-1\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\n\nSummary of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog\u00eda Agropecuaria,\nINTA).\nIn 2009, three sub-samples of soil profiles per plot were sampled and fresh mixed at five depths (0\u201320, 20\u201340,\n40\u201360, 60\u201380, and 80\u2013100 cm), dried at 40 \u00b0C until constant weight, and sieved (2 mm). Soil extractable-K was\ndetermined as \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K [50], and by the modified sodium tetraphenyl boron method \u00ad(NaBPh 4 -K) [9] . The vertical distribution of both \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K was expressed on a volumetric basis (g \u00adm [\u22122] ) as in Jobbagy\nand \u00adJackson [16] . Bulk density, determined for Control and NPS plots at the onset of the study for each soil layer\n(Table 1), was used to transform from gravimetric (mg \u00adkg [\u22121] ) to volumetric units (g \u00adm [\u22122] ).\n\n\n**Statistical analysis.** For testing the first hypothesis, variables of interest were the topsoil \u00adNH 4 OAc-K\n(0\u201320 cm) for 2000, 2004 and 2009 years and the apparent cumulative K budget (kg \u00adha [\u22121] ) of both the Control and NPS treatments. For the apparent cumulative K budget, treatment with two levels (Control and NPS),\nand the crop number with 12 (La Blanca, La Hansa) and 13 (Balducchi and San Alfredo) levels (2000\u20132008)\nand their interactions were considered the fixed factors while the block was considered as random. For topsoil\n\u00adNH 4 OAc-K, treatment with two levels (Control and NPS), year with three levels (2000, 2004 and 2009) and their\ninteractions were considered as fixed, while block was considered as random. In both cases, a mixed effect model\nwith repeated measures over time was applied using the _nlme_ \u00adpackage [56] of the R \u00adsoftware [57] . Additionally, the\nrelationship between the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K with the apparent cumulative K budgets (2000, 2004 and 2009) was tested\nwith a simple linear regression model by pooling data from all four locations.\nFor the second hypothesis, \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K contents (g \u00adm [\u22122] ) were considered to evaluate the\nagricultural footprint (Pristine, Control and NPS in 2009). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was partitioned\nby location. For vertical distributions of \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K, we applied a mixed effect models with\nrepeated measures over space (soil depth) using the _nlme_ \u00adpackage [56] . Thereby, treatment, soil depth and their\ninteractions were considered as fixed factors, while block was considered as random factor. The fulfillment of\nthe assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance for the K budget, \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K were\nvisually (QQ-plots and Student\u2019s residuals vs. fitted values) and formally evaluated (Shapiro-Wilks normality test).\nFinally, we selected the best models based on the lowest scores for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Means\nand significant interactions were obtained using the LSMEAN/PDIFF procedure using the _emmeans_ \u00adpackage [58] .\nFor the third hypothesis, regression analyses were executed to estimate the effect of soil texture (clay, silt\nand sand -%-) and pristine K richness (Pristine \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K) on the depletion of \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K\nand \u00adNaBPh 4 -K. A stepwise selection was applied using the _stepAIC_ function from the MASS \u00adpackage [59] to define\nthe most relevant variables linearly associated with both depletions. Once variables were selected, partial linear\nand linear-plateau relationships were further tested for interpretation purposes using the _stats_ package v3.6.2 [57] .\n\n\nReceived: 14 January 2021; Accepted: 10 May 2021\n\n\n**References**\n1.
