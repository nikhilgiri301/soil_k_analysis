It is crucial for the efficient use of K resources,\n\nfood security and resource sustainability to realize soil K balance status in China. Therefore,\n\ntemporal and spatial changes of K balance for farmland in China from 1980 to 2015 were\n\nanalyzed at national and regional levels using statistical data and related parameters. At the\n\nnational scale, K input increased from 6.78 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 23.44 Mt K 2 O in 2015 with an\n\naverage annual increment of 0.48 Mt K 2 O, and output changed from 8.10 Mt in 1980 to\n\n21.31 Mt in 2015 with an average annual increment of 0.38 Mt K 2 O as well. On average, K\nbalance was -24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,\n\nrespectively. Moreover, the average balance of six regions was considerably different which\nwere -21.37, 1.25, 13.70, -22.79, 99.22 and 7.18 kg K 2 O ha [-1] from 1980 to 2015. The potas\nsium use efficiency (KUE) decreased with time which were 127.09, 104.35, 87.69 and\n\n89.69% in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively, and the decline of slope could also\n\nreflect the variation tendency of KUE. Great variation of K balance across different regions\n\ndemonstrated that fertilizer application and management practices need to be adjusted to\n\nlocal conditions.\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nLow soil fertility is one of the main constraints of agricultural productivity, so enhancing soil\nfertility is the basis for guaranteeing food security [1, 2]. The recommended means of improving soil fertility is by regulating farmland nutrient cycles and balance through rational fertilization [3]. Balanced fertilizer application can not only save resources, but also improve\neconomic benefits. Nutrient balances (also known as nutrient budgets) are calculated by the\ndifference between nutrient inputs and outputs of a system with predefined spatiotemporal\nboundaries [4]. Thus, they are generally expressed as an amount of nutrient per unit of area\n\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 1 / 17\n\n\n1610132016011). The funders had no role in study\ndesign, data collection and analysis, decision to\npublish, or preparation of the manuscript.\n\n\n**Competing interests:** The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\nand time (e.g., kg ha [-1] yr [-1] ). Negative nutrient balances indicate that a system is losing nutrients,\nhowever in some cases, nutrients apparently accumulate (and might lead to nutrient losses if\nstrongly in excess). Nutrient balances have been used extensively for improving natural resource\nmanagement and/or for recommendations over the last decades [5\u20139]; they are useful tools as\nindicators of potential land degradation and for optimizing nutrient use in agricultural systems\nto maintain sustainability of soil nutrient resources and agricultural production [10, 11]. Therefore, maintaining the balance between plant nutrient inputs and outputs in agroecosystems has\nbecome very important for sustainable development and soil quality [12, 13].\nTo provide enough food for the continuously growing population in China, large quantities\nof fertilizers, mainly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers, have been used in agriculture\n\n[3, 14]. However, potassium (K), an essential element for crops, has often been neglected [15].\nPotassium deficiency is a global problem [16] and there have been huge changes in soil K all\nover the world, from Europe [17, 18] to Africa [19, 20] to Asia [21, 22], and North America\n\n[23]. China suffered a serious soil K deficiency from 1961 to 1997 [24]. Liu et al. [25] indicated\nthat soil K had been a limiting factor for sustainable agricultural production especially in some\nparts of northeast and north-central China. In recent years, soil K deficiency has been relieved\nwith the increase in fertilizer K application and straw return. Shen et al. [13] indicated that\nalthough the soil K balance was deficient in the period from 1993 to 2001, the situation was\nimproved from 1999 to 2001. Several studies also showed that significant soil K surpluses were\nobserved in vegetable production in Hebei [26], Shandong [27] and Jiangsu provinces [3].\nPrevious studies about K balance have mainly focused on specific experimental sites [15,\n28\u201331] or short-term observations at national level [32], but it is difficult to show in-depth\nanalysis of element balances based on specific experimental sites or one-year studies [3].\nAlthough a negative K balance might not occur in the short term, long-term negative K balance is still a potential problem [33]. Because nutrient balances can vary considerably from\nyear to year, short-term studies providing limited information might be misleading [24]; Sheldrick et al. [24] also emphasized the importance of using nutrient balances at the national level\nwhich would help to develop national fertilizer policies including decisions on investments in\nfertilizer factories and the exploitation of local resources and minerals to supply nutrients.\nInformation on temporal variability of K balances in agroecosystems at the national level\ncould be of great benefit for policymakers and farmers in finding strategies and measures for\nreasonable use of K resources to ensure food security [13], as described in previous studies [24,\n34\u201336].\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the temporal and spatial variation in K balances\nand K use efficiency in China from 1980 to 2015. The results will help to identify regions with\npoor soil fertility and assist in putting forward strategies by rational nutrient management to\nimprove low-yielding field.\n\n\n**Materials and methods**\n\n\nStudy area\n\n\nBased on 31 provincial data sets, gross soil K balance was calculated in mainland China excluding Hong Kong and Macao. China is divided into six regions according to geographical locations and China\u2019s administrative divisions, as shown in S1 Table [32, 37].\n\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe data used in this paper, such as chemical fertilizer, livestock numbers, crop yield, population number living in the countryside, planting area and cultivated land area, were obtained\nfrom the China Agriculture Statistical Report [38].\n\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 2 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\nIn this study, data pre-processing primarily included original data verification. The former\nsteps included filling in the missing data, data validation and derivative data construction.\nAfter that, a reasonable database was built, which included provincial K balance data from\n1980 to 2015. For the sake of analysis, we compared the K balance across four decades: 1980s\n(1980\u20131989), 1990s (1990\u20131999), 2000s (2000\u20132009) and 2010s (2010\u20132015).\nBecause of the enormous amount of data in the original database, it was difficult to identify\nthe flawed data. Therefore, a strict rule was applied for those indicators: the data from adjacent\nyears could not vary by more than 15%. The missing data could be filled in either by referring\nto a statistical yearbook/published literature or by using the data from adjacent years. However, some indicators that did not exist in the original database needed to be acquired from\nother indicators. For example, the amount of straw is a required indicator, but it can only be\ncalculated by multiplying grain crop production by a literature survey-based conversion factor\n(the ratio of grain to straw), which is distinguishing for different crops. The parameters needed\nin this model for K balance calculations in Chinese farmland were explained in Liu et al. [39];\nspatial variation of parameters was estimated by region.\n\n\nSoil K balance model description\n\n\nThe soil K balance model included the following inputs: chemical fertilizer, organic manure,\natmospheric dry and wet deposition, irrigation and crop seeds (K 2 O, similarly hereinafter)\n\n[39]. In detail, the organic fertilizer resources were categorized by human and animal manure,\nstraw and cake manure. The following outputs were used: crops removal (including grain and\nstraw uptake) and nutrient loss (leaching and runoff loss).\n**Chemical fertilizer inputs.** The ratio for K 2 O in compound fertilizer was different in different regions and years, as shown in S1 Table [32, 37].\n**Organic manure inputs.** The organic manure resources mainly include human and livestock manure, straw return and cake manure. The human and livestock manure including the\nparameters of livestock feeding period, daily excretion, K 2 O content and application rates to\nfield were listed in Table 1 [39\u201341]. The quantity of crop straw was calculated through grain\nyields and the ratio of grain to straw for each type of crops and the K contents in straw were\ncollected from published studies (Table 2) [42]. The rates of straw return to fields in the 2000s\nand 2010s were published in Li and Jin [32] with 15% in NE and NW, 60% in NC and 30% in\nthe MLYR, SE and SW. In the 1980s and 1990s, the crop straw was removed from fields and\nreturned back into the soil with burned ashes to different extents. The straw return rates in the\n\n1980s were about 1/3 of those in the 2000s, (5% in NE and NW, 20% in NC and 10% in the\nMLYR, SE and SW). In the 1990s, the straw return rate was 2/3 of those in the 2000s, (10% in\nNE and NW, 40% in NC and 20% in the MLYR, SE and SW). The cake production rate of different crops and the K content in cake manure were collected from published data (S2 Table) [39].\n**Other inputs.** In addition to chemical fertilizer and organic manure, atmospheric dry\nand wet deposition, irrigation and crop seeds were analyzed as sources of farmland nutrients\n(S3 Table).\n**Arable crop outputs.** The amount of arable crop outputs was the principal nutrient output in the agricultural system which was calculated through economic yield and K requirement\nfor unit of economic yield of different crops (Table 3) [32, 39]. The arable crop outputs were\ncategorized into five kinds of crops, including cereal crops, fruit and vegetables (fruit, vegetable\nand melons), oil crops (oil crops and beans), industrial crops (sugar beet, sugar cane, fiber\ncrops, cotton and tobacco) and root crops (sweet potato and potato).\n**Leaching and runoff outputs.** Few reports have been published quantifying accurate\namounts of K 2 O leaching and runoff outputs. This type of output only accounted for a small\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 3 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\n**Table 1.

At the\nregional level, the K output in the MLYR, SE and SW was high in 2015 and fluctuated suddenly\n(increasing from 120.25, 135.02 and 113.35 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to 257.74, 275.28 and 262.60\nkg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015), followed by the NC (increasing from 74.77 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to\n218.70 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015), and then the NE and NW (increasing from 62.78 and 33.65 kg\nK 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to 102.80 and 125.85 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015). Nevertheless, the K output in the\nNE increased slowly with some fluctuations from 1982 to 1989, thereafter stabilizing from\n1990 (94.47 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to 2015.\nThere were significant variations in K output at the regional level (negative values in the Fig\n4). The K outputs in MLYR and SE were significantly larger than those in other regions. The K\noutput in SW was significantly larger than that in NE, NC and NW. In addition, the K output\nin NC was significantly larger than that in NE and NW. There was no significant variation in\nK output between NE and NW. The K outputs all increased significantly over the past four\ndecades except for NE which increased from the 1980s to the 1990s, but it didn\u2019t change from\nthe 1990s to the 2010s.

The main K output source was cereals crops, which\nincreased over time for all regions except for SE. As for the other output sources, the K output\nfrom fruit & vegetables and oil crops accounted for a larger part for all regions except for SE in\nwhich the larger sources of K the output were fruit & vegetables and industrial crops.\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation in K balance\n\n\n**Temporal variation in K balance in China.** At the national scale, the average K balance\nfrom 1980 to 2015 was 0.81 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] .

After that time, the K balance reached a slight surplus and remained relatively stable from 2003 (2.74 Mt K 2 O) to 2015 (2.13 Mt K 2 O) (Fig 1A). On average, K balance\nincreased by -24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,\nrespectively.\n**Temporal and spatial variation in K balance by regions.** As it was shown in the lie graph\n(Fig 3C), the average K balance in six regions from 1980 to 2015 varied widely with values of\n-21.37, 1.25, 13.70, -22.79, 99.22 and 7.18 kg K 2 O ha [-1], respectively. The annual K balance\nshowed different trends in six regions (Fig 3C). The K balance in the SE moved into surplus\nfrom 1985 onwards, while the K balance in NE remained in the negative changing from -25.44\nkg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to -11.90 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015. Additionally, other four regions all reached\nbalance by 2002. In detail, the balance in the SE increased from 1980 to 2005 (186.88 kg K 2 O\nha [-1] ) even though the K balance had a short term decrease from 1995 to 1998; after 2005 it\nremained relatively stable to 2015 (202.29 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ). In addition, the balance in the NW\nwas slightly in surplus and remained relatively stable from 1980 (32.02 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to 2015\n(8.21 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ).

If the points were\naround the line, it meant that the K in some places had reached to a balance stage. Additionally, data points in the 1980s were scattered largely above and below the 1:1 line while more\ndata points in the 1990s aggregated around the line; more data points were below the line in\nthe 2000s and 2010s.\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variability in the K balance\n\n\nThere was great spatial variation for K input and output which was correlated with the different crops and soil fertility [30, 43]. Results in this study indicated that K input and output\nincreased dramatically with time. The K input kept increasing as the use of chemical fertilizer\nincreased year by year, whereas the K output also continued to increase because of the increase\nin crop yield and change of K output from different crops. For example, the proportion of K\nremoval in output for cereals crops (low K uptake) decreased from 70.2% to 55.8%, but it\nincreased from 8.7% to 24.1% for fruit & vegetables (high K uptake) in the past four decades.\nHowever, the input and output in the NW were lower over the past four decades than those in\nother regions because of the low chemical K fertilizer application and low crop yields [43, 44].\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 12 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\nOn one hand, over-reliance on the imported K fertilizer and the increasing cost limited the use\nof K fertilizer [13, 24, 45]. On the other hand, some farmers believed that N and P application\nplayed a more important role in increasing crop yield than K fertilizer [46] because the application of K fertilizer does not produce results as quickly as N and P fertilizer application; this is\nbecause of the high soil K supply capacity with high K-containing minerals such as micas and\nfeldspars in the soil parent material [47, 48].\nConversely, the K balance increased steadily, which was mainly attributed to improvement\nof the social economy and improved management among farmer households [3]. For example,\nchemical fertilizer application in the SE increased dramatically with economic development,\nleading to a substantial surplus in the K balance. Another important reason for the improved\nK balance is that more crop residues were returned back to soils with the development of agricultural mechanization [43]. In addition, K balance in the NE was still deficient which indicated that K input in the NE was insufficient to meet crop production. However, the soil\navailable K in NE was stable from the 1990s to the 2000s [43], which implied that the abovementioned K input sources were not the only source of K for crop absorption and that soil K\nmineralization also played a substantial role. In this study, the K balance in the NW was stable\nat the equilibrium state over four decades, but the soil available K decreased from the 1990s to\nthe 2000s [43]. One of the reasons for this might because K was easily fixed with the alternation\nof dry and wet climate conditions [49]; this might result in decreasing K availability because of\nthe slow mineralization of returned straw [50, 51].\n\n\nK fertilization predictions and recommendations\n\n\nThe nutrient balance exhibited a strong relationship with nutrient management and sustainable agricultural development [3], so it was necessary to budget the agricultural nutrient balance on a macro level, especially for policy makers who need to be informed on national\nsituations. The K balance prediction in 2020 was mainly based on the policy of zero growth of\nchemical fertilizer and 60% straw and manure return rates. So far, the crop yield in 2015 was\nthe highest and could be regarded as the optimal level. We assumed that if zero growth of\nchemical fertilizer is achieved by 2020 and crop yields is maintained at the optimal level as\nthose in 2015, the K balance for China will be 76.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] . Large temporal and spatial\nvariation in the K balance highlighted that fertilizer application and management practices\nneed to be adjusted based on local conditions. For example, the K surplus in the SE was over\n70% in recent years, which demonstrated that the potential for decreasing K fertilizer application in SE was large. Therefore, it is realistic to decrease chemical K fertilization whilst maintaining high and steady yields without increasing cropping areas. Furthermore, reducing the\nrate of K fertilizer applied was effective in reducing K surplus and enhancing the KUE [52].\nThe K fertilizer application could be decreased by 202.29 kg K 2 O ha [-1] to maintain equilibrium\nin the K balance. In contrast, it is essential to apply more K fertilizer timely and efficiently in\nboth NE and NW in order to maintain the soil K balance over the long-term because of the\ndecline in the K supply capacity. Reports indicated that straw return alone was not sufficient to\nmaintain the soil K balance although more crop residues were returned back to soils with the\ndevelopment of agricultural mechanization [47, 53, 54]. Nevertheless, it is necessary to pay\nattention to the rational utilization of organic manure, especially cow urine in the field, and\ncombine it with the same rate of commercial fertilizer in order to alleviate the K deficit [3, 18].\n\nThe K balance in the SE showed a short-term decrease from 1995 to 1998 because of the reduc\ntion in the number of cattle, which indicated that cow urine contributed substantially to the K\nbalance. Certainly, nutrient management recommendations must change with yield levels and\nprofit maximization in crop production systems [55].\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 13 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\nKUE\n\n\nPotassium use efficiency (KUE) is the uptake efficiency defined as the percentage of K input\nthat is recovered as K output in crops [3, 12, 34]. The KUE in China decreased with time\nbecause of increasing K application rate which suggested that the effect of K fertilizer on\nincreasing grain production had diminished [55, 56]. From the distribution of data in Fig 7,\nthe soil K balance in the 1990s in China was the most reasonable period during the past four\ndecades, which was in accordance with the K balance results (-24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50\nK 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively). Nevertheless, the K balances went\ninto surplus in several provinces in the 2000s and 2010s, which indicated that K fertilization\nhas deserved more attention with time. However, great spatial variability in KUE existed\nwith values of 138.63, 107.28, 83.02, 121.65, 73.97 and 97.22% in the 2010s for NE, NC, NW,\nMLYR, SE and SW, respectively. The KUE in SE was the lowest because of the overuse of K\nfertilizer.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nIt is necessary to budget the soil K nutrient balance on the national level, especially for policy\nmakers. The tendency toward N and P surplus and K deficit has been addressed and corrected,\nbut large spatial variation in the K balance in this study highlighted that fertilizer application\nand management practices need to be adjusted depending on local conditions. Well-managed\nfertilizer use can create a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation by increasing food production and reducing soil\ndegradation in nutrient-poor, fragile soils. Increased K fertilizer application has led to a reduction in fertilizer use efficiency in China. There is an urgent need for the government to act\ndecisively on this issue. The effect of K balance on crop yields under different soil fertility\nshould be verified in different soil types in further studies, to continue the application and\nextension of these results. Therefore, K fertilizer management needs to consider the soil K balance so as to build up a soil K pool to guarantee both high yield and high efficiency of K fertilizer. It is hoped that these results will provide a basis for rational K nutrient management in\nthe Chinese agricultural system.\n\n\n**Supporting information**\n\n\n**[S1 Table.
