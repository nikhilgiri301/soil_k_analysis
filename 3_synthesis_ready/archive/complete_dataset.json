However, no publicly-available global dataset**\n**currently exists for how crop residues are managed. Here we present such a dataset, covering the period**\n**1997\u20132021, on a 0.5\u00b0 resolution grid. For each grid cell we estimate the total production of residues**\n**from cereal crops, and determine the fraction of residues (i) used for livestock feed/bedding, (ii) burnt**\n**on the field, (iii) used for other off-field purposes (e.g. domestic fuel, construction or industry), and**\n**(iv) left on the field. This dataset is the first of its kind, and can be used for multiple purposes, such as**\n**global crop modelling, including the calculation of greenhouse gas inventories, estimating crop-residue**\n**availability for biofuel production or modelling livestock feed availability.**\n\n\n**Background & Summary**\nAbove-ground crop residues, such as the stalks and stover of cereal plants, are an important resource, since they\nrepresent more biomass than is harvested as grain and have an embodied energy equal to about 15% of global\nhuman primary energy usage [1] (below-ground residues are not considered here since, for cereals, they are almost\nnever removed from the field). They account for approximately 19% of livestock feed by weight, and are therefore crucial for the production of meat and milk [2][,][3] . They also play an important role as a domestic fuel, especially\nin poorer countries. For example, during the mid 1990s in China biomass burning, of which crop residues constituted more than 50%, provided more energy than was derived from oil [4] . Residues left on the field are also an\nimportant source of C and N for agricultural soils, helping to maintain or enhance soil organic carbon (SOC)\nstocks [5][\u2013][7], resulting in better retention of nutrients in the soil, reduced sensitivity of plant growth to drought,\nlower erosion rates and better soil aeration [8] . At the same time, approximately 10% of crop residues are treated as\na waste product and burnt on the field [9] . This clears the way for subsequent planting, helps to control pests and\ndiseases and avoids the costs associated with collecting and transporting the residues. However, burning releases\nparticles into the atmosphere that are damaging to human health and contributes to climate change via CH 4 and\nN 2 O emissionsThe scientific literature contains a variety of suggestions for how a change in crop residue management could [10][\u2013][12] .\naddress pressing global issues, such as climate change or the loss of naturally vegetated land. These include\npartial replacement of fossil fuels with bioenergy generated from crop residues [1][,][13][\u2013][15], leaving a higher fraction of crop residues on the field to increase SOC stocks and thus sequester CO 2 from the atmosphere [16] and\nreplacing human-edible grains in livestock diets with crop residues, allowing for a reduction in cropland area [17] .\nUnfortunately, assessing the effectiveness of any of these proposals is hindered by a lack of knowledge about how\ncrop residues are currently being used, leading to an uncertain baseline and making it difficult to determine the\ntrade-offs associated with allocating a higher fraction of crop residues to a specific usage.\nHere we address this knowledge gap by constructing a dataset showing crop residue management for cereals on a 0.5\u00b0 global grid and at an annual timescale for the period 1997\u20132021. We focus on cereals, since they\naccount for the majority of crop residue production (approximately 73% in 2020 [18] ), and have a similar energy\nand protein content, making them relatively uniform in their potential uses [19] . In each grid cell we estimate both\ncrop residue production and the fraction of crop residues that are (1) burnt on the field (2) used for animal\nfeed or bedding (3) used for other off-field purposes such as domestic fuel, industry, mushroom cultivation or\nconstruction and (4) left on the field (see Fig. 1). We consider a relatively fine spatial scale, since the high cost\n\n\nInstitute of Meteorology and Climate Research, Atmospheric Environmental Research (IMK-IFU), Karlsruhe Institute of\nTechnology (KIT), Kreuzeckbahnstr. 19, 82467, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

Incorporating our dataset into regional and global modelling will thus lead to better identification\nof areas that are hotspots for environmentally harmful losses (e.g. of greenhouse gases) and of areas that would\nsee the greatest benefits from changes in residue management. Second, the dataset can be used to evaluate the\ntrade-offs between different crop residue management options in a spatially explicit way. For example, it can\nbe used to assess the trade-off between soil carbon sequestration, energy generation from biofuel production,\nand feeding livestock. Currently these trade-offs are either not considered [34][,][36] or only considered at country [15],\nregional [38] or global scale [39] .\n\n\n**Methods**\nThe general strategy employed was to (1) determine crop residue production (2) estimate the quantity of crop\nresidues removed from the field via burning, for animal feed/bedding and other off-field uses and (3) assume\nthe remainder are left on the field after harvest (see Fig. 2). Since multiple methods have been proposed in the\nliterature for determining residue production, biomass burning and livestock feed requirements, we determined\na mean value of each of these quantities. This involved averaging three different methods for determining crop\nresidue production, two different datasets for agricultural biomass burning and three different methods for\nestimating the quantity of crop residues fed to livestock. The same calculational scheme was also used to explore\nthe 18 possible combinations of input data. This resulted in an ensemble of results that allowed us to define a\nmeasure of uncertainty (see Fig. 1e,f).\n\n\n**Cereal residue production.** Crop residue production is typically estimated from grain production via harvest indices, which measure the ratio of residue to grain production [1][,][15][,][38][\u2013][41] . Grain production data was taken\nfrom the SPAM dataset, which provides gridded, crop-specific production and harvested areas at 5 arcminute resolution [42][,][43] . This was aggregated to 0.5\u00b0 resolution and then scaled to match FAO data for yearly, country-specific\n\n\nScientific **Data** | _(2023) 10:685_ [| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0) 3\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificdata/ www.nature.com/scientificdata\n\n|Col1|a (\u2212)|b (ha/Mg)|c (\u2212)|d (ha/Mg)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Barley|1.822|0.149|2.77|0.27|\n|Maize|2.656|0.103|2.2|0.13|\n|Rice|2.45|0.084|2.56|0.22|\n|Wheat|2.183|0.127|1.96|0.14|\n|Millet|1.9|0.250|4.38|0.95|\n|Sorghum|2.302|0.100|4.55|0.55|\n|Other cereals|1.9|0.250|2.7|0.2|\n\n\n\n**Table 2.** Parameters used to convert grain yields to residue yields.\n\n\ngrain production and harvested areas [9] (a similar approach was for example used in _Grogan et al_ . [44] ). The result was\na gridded time series for the target period of 1997\u20132021.\nIn order to convert grain production to crop residue production, we considered three different methods. (1)\n_Residue production ratios -_ a set of fixed ratios was used to convert grain production to crop residue production.\nThese ratios are crop and region specific, but constant over time [17] . (2) _Exponential yield dependence_                 - grain yields\nwere converted to crop residue yields using the empirical formula [1],\n\n\n\n_bY_\n\n\n\n\u2264\n\n\n\n\n\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4 _aYe_ \u2212 _for Y_ \u2264 1/ _b_\n\n_R_ = \uf8f2 _a_\n\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4 _be_ 1 _for Y_       - 1/ _b_\n\n\n\n1/\n\n\n1/\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\uf8f1\n\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nwhere _R_ is the crop residue yield (Mg/ha), _Y_ is the grain yield (Mg/ha) and _a_ and _b_ are crop specific parameters\ndetermined by fitting measurement data and shown in Table 2 [1][,][40] . Using a yield-dependent function accounts for\nvariation in the residue production ratio over time, for example due to increasing grain yields. (3) _Linear yield_\n_dependence_               - grain yields were converted to crop residue yields using the empirical formula,\n\n\n_R_ = _Y c_ ( \u2212 _dY_ )\n\n\nwhere _c_ and _d_ 2 [40] .\nare crop specific parameters determined by fitting measurement data and shown in Table\nFinally, crop-specific values for residue production were combined to give total cereal-residue production.\n\n\n**On-field burning.** We considered two data sources for the on-field burning of agricultural biomass: (1) The\nGlobal Fire Emissions Database (GFED4s) provides monthly estimates of total agricultural biomass burning at\na 0.25\u00b0 resolution for the period 1997\u20132021. This is based on a combination of satellite observations and biogeochemical modelling [45][,][46] ; (2) The Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv2.5) provides a global list of fires with\nassociated location, date, vegetation-type and total biomass burned for the period 2002\u20132021 [47][,][48] . In both cases\nwe aggregated the data to determine the total yearly burning of agricultural biomass on a 0.5\u00b0 global grid. While\ncereal residues form the dominant type of agricultural residues burnt on a global scale (approximately 96% [9] ),\nother residues can be locally important, especially sugar cane. For example, in Brazil sugar cane accounts for 24%\nof burnt agricultural biomass [9] . This is partially accounted for by limiting the total biomass burning in each grid\ncell to be a maximum of 90% of the cereal residue production (see validation section for additional discussion).\n\n\n**Ruminant feed.** Cereal residues are an important feed for ruminants, especially cattle, sheep and goats, but\nare unpalatable to monogastric animals such as pigs and chickens. As such, there is a clear divide, with most of\nthe residues fed to ruminants derived from cereals, while other important residue classes, such as those from\nsugarcane and legumes, are predominantly fed to monogastrics [17][,][49] .\nIn order to calculate crop residue usage for ruminant feed, country specific data for meat and milk production from cattle, sheep and goats for the period 1997\u20132021 was obtained from FAOSTAT [9] . The production\nwas then apportioned to grid cells based on the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW 3) dataset, which gives\nestimates of animal numbers (including cattle, sheep and goats) for the year 2010 [50][\u2013][53], resulting in a gridded\nproduction time series for 1997\u20132021. Meat and milk production numbers in each grid cell were transformed\ninto crop residue usage via feed conversion ratios (FCRs) and crop residue feed fractions (CRFFs). FCRs give the\nquantity of feed (kg-dry-matter) required to produce a given quantity of meat or milk protein at the herd level\n(i.e. they take into account the need to also feed unproductive animals, such as juveniles). CRFFs give the typical\nfraction by weight that crop residues make up in an animal\u2019s diet. Regional averages for FCRs and CRFFs have\nbeen tabulated in the literature and we use three different sources: (1) _Herrero et al_ . [2] provide FCRs and CRFFs\nfor 10 world regions, and further divide these by animal type (cattle or small ruminant), production type (meat\nor milk), livestock production system (grazing, mixed, urban or other) and climate (arid, temperate or tropical);\n(2) _Mekonnen and Hoekstra_ [54] give FCRs for 10 world regions divided by animal type (cattle or small ruminant),\nproduction system (grazing, mixed and industrial) and production type (meat or milk, only cattle); (3) _Mottet_\n_et al_ . [3] provides FCRs and CRFFs for two world regions (OECD and non-OECD), divided by production system\n(grazing, mixed or feedlot). Since _Mekonnen and Hoekstra_ don\u2019t give CRFFs, we combine their FCRs with the\nCRFFs of _Herrero et al_ . The dominant livestock production system in each 0.5\u00b0 grid cell is determined from the\nGlobal Distribution of Ruminant Livestock Production Systems (GRPS 5) dataset, which documents livestock\nproduction systems on a scale of 5 arcminutes, including climate information (arid, temperate or tropical) [55] .\n\n\nScientific **Data** | _(2023) 10:685_ [| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0) 4\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificdata/ www.nature.com/scientificdata\n\n\nWhere necessary, the protein content of meat and milk was calculated using 138 g-protein/kg for bovine meat,\n137 g-protein/kg for sheep and goat meat and 33 g-protein/kg for milk [2] . The outcome of these calculations was\nthree distinct estimates for crop residue usage by animals. These numbers were further modified by crop residue\navailability (see below).\n\n\n**Animal bedding and horse feed.** On a global scale, data concerning the use of crop residues for animal\nbedding is scarce. However, it can form a significant fraction of livestock crop residue usage in richer countries,\nwhere residues typically don\u2019t form an important part of ruminant diets [2][,][3][,][54] . Here we use estimated bedding\nrequirements for the EU [15], and apply these on a global scale. Our assumption is that these numbers are reasonable\nfor richer countries, where bedding makes up a higher proportion of livestock residue usage. Taking into account\nseasonal differences and differences between production systems, we consider a bedding usage of 0.375 kg/day for\ncattle, 0.1 kg/day for sheep and goats, 1.5 kg/day for horses and 0.0625 kg/day for pigs [15] . These daily requirements\nare converted to gridded yearly requirements using the GLW 3 dataset for animal populations [50][\u2013][53][,][56][,][57] . For horses\nwe additionally include 420 kg-fresh-matter/year of straw usage for chewing [58] . Crop residue usage for poultry\nbedding is not considered, since industrial farms typically use other materials, such as sawdust [59] .\n\n\n**Trading of crop residues.** For some grid cells, the estimate of animal residue usage exceeds residue availability. This is unsurprising, since it is known that crop residues are traded for use as animal feed/bedding. For\nexample, in the UK crop residue demand in the livestock-dominated west, is partially met by importing cereal\nresidues from the arable-dominated east [60] . In order to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand, we allow\nfor trade from over- to under-supplied grid cells. We consider a grid cell to be in deficit if the combined on-field\nburning and animal usage exceed 90% of crop residue production. Deficit grid cells are allowed to import surplus\nproduction from nearby grid cells, favouring local supply, but with a maximum distance of 20 grid cells (approximately 1000 km at the equator). The total global deficit before taking trade into account is 270\u2013510 Tg/yr (i.e. the\nsum of residue deficits across all grid cells in which a deficit exists). After the trade correction this is reduced to\n60\u2013100 Tg/yr. Finally, remaining deficits are assumed to arise from a local overestimation of animal usage and are\nset to zero, meaning that the combination of on-field burning and animal usage never exceeds 90% of production.\n\n\n**Other off field uses.** In poorer countries, a significant fraction of crop residues may be burnt for domestic\nfuel [4] . The extent of burning largely depends on the availability of other fuels, such as wood, and on competition\nwith the demand for animal feed. In large parts of Africa and South Asia, the high demand for animal feed leaves\nlittle available for other off-field uses (see Fig. 1b). However, in China, where livestock production is dominated\nby monogastrics [9] and forest cover is low by global standards [9], crop residues have been historically important as a\ndomestic fuel. In the mid-1990s, when China\u2019s GDP was only marginally above the threshold that the World Bank\nconsiders to be low income, _Sinton et al_ . [4] report that approximately 4 EJ of energy was generated by domestic\nburning of crop residues. Assuming that 18 MJ/kg of energy is released [1], and that approximately 730 Tg/yr of\nresidues were produced in China at that time, results in 30% of crop residues being used for domestic fuel. We\ntake the figure of 30% as an upper bound for crop residue usage for other off-field purposes in poorer countries\n(also including construction materials, mushroom cultivation etc.), with the proviso that outside of China a lack\nof availability means that this boundary is rarely reached (see Fig. 1c and also Supplementary Note 1 for a comparison of the dataset to the results of site-scale farmer surveys in Africa and South Asia). When applying this\nupper boundary we follow the World Bank in defining poor countries as those with GDP per capita of less than\n$1046 in 2015 prices.\nFor rich countries, other off-field uses include usage for industry, construction, the cultivation of mushrooms\nand strawberries, energy generation via biogas reactors and losses during transport and storage [18] . In Germany it\nis estimated that these other uses account for approximately 4% of crop residue production (excluding losses) [58],\nwhile in Denmark, which has an exceptionally large biogas generating capacity, they account for 23% [61] . We\nassume that approximately 10% of crop residues are used for other off field purposes in rich countries, which are\ndefined as those with GDP per capita greater than $12735 at 2015 prices.\nFor each grid cell, the fraction of other off-field uses is determined by the GDP per capita of the corresponding country, along with crop residue availability. For middle income countries the maximum usage is determined by linearly interpolating between the poor country (30%) and rich country (10%) values according to\nGDP per capita. Changes in GDP per capita over time thus result in a changing upper bound for other off-field\ncrop residue usage. Residue removal via a combination of on-field burning, animal usage and other usage is\ncapped at 90% of production.\n\n\n**Crop residues left on field.** Crop residues not assigned another usage are assumed to be left on the field.\nDue to the constraints above, at least 10% of residues are left on the field, and this is imposed due to the difficulty of fully removing residues. In addition, we impose a maximum fraction of crop residues left on the field\nin a limited number of countries and regions, assigning any excess to other off-field uses. The aim is to further\nimprove the balance between on-field and off-field uses of crop residues, compensating for the lack of global\ndata about crop residue use for domestic fuel, industry, construction, biofuels etc. In China we impose a limit of\n60% of residues returned to the field in every grid cell. This results in a good match to literature values, where it\nwas reported that 46% (2009) [62] and 52% (2019) [63] of residues were returned to the field. Using the 60% limit our\ndataset estimates 47% (2009) and 51% (2019), while in the absence of such a limit the figures are 51% (2009) and\n60% (2019) (see also Supplementary Note 2). In Europe, it has been estimated that 40\u201370% of crop residues need\nto be returned to the field to maintain soil organic carbon and avoid erosion [15] . We thus assume that it is rare for\nmore than 70% of residues to be returned to the field, since this is not necessary for agricultural reasons, and\nselling excess straw is a way to supplement farm income. In North America and Oceania we impose a higher limit\n\n\nScientific **Data** | _(2023) 10:685_ [| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0) 5\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificdata/ www.nature.com/scientificdata\n\n\nof 80%, since the often semi-arid conditions require a higher percentage of residues to be returned to the field to\nguard against erosion [64] . For Australia we find good agreement between the estimate of our dataset (74% returned\nto the field in 2012) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (76% in 2012) [65] . On a global scale, the imposition of\nmaximum return rates results in 3% of production being shifted from on-field to off-field usage.\n\n\n**Data Records**\n[The datasets are stored as netCDF files in the RADAR4KIT repository and can be accessed at https://doi.](https://doi.org/10.35097/989)\n[org/10.35097/989](https://doi.org/10.35097/989) [66] . The spatial resolution is a 0.5\u00b0 global grid and the temporal resolution is annual for the\nyears 1997\u20132021.\n\n\n**Main dataset.** Values obtained with mean input values are intended as the default dataset. The filename is:\ncrop_residue_usage_mean.nc\n\n\n**Additional datasets.** There are 18 additional datasets, corresponding to all possible method combinations\n(see Methods section above) [66] . The naming convention is:\n\n\ncrop_residue_usage_{ _residue_production_ratio_ }_{ _livestock_source_ }_{ _fire_dataset_ }.nc\nwhere:\n{ _residue_production_ratio_ } = constant, exponential, linear\n{ _livestock_source_ } = herrero, mottet, mekonnen\n{ _fire_dataset_ } = GFED4s, FINN\n\n\nEach dataset has 5 layers and all units are Mg/year:\n\n\n1. _residue_production_ :- crop residue production from cereals\n2. _burnt_residues_ :- residues burnt on the field\n3. _animal_usage_ :- residues used for livestock feed and bedding\n4. _other_usage_ :- residues used for other off-field purposes (domestic fuel, construction\u2026)\n5.\n_left_on_field_ :- residues left on the field\n\n\nFor each grid cell and year the residue production (1) is equal to the sum of (2), (3), (4) and (5), meaning that\nall residues are assigned a use. Fractional residue usage is simply calculated by dividing the specific residue usage\nby the residue production.\n\n\n**Technical Validation**\nIn order to validate our dataset, we have collected literature values for cereal residue production and fractional\nresidue usage. We only considered studies that (1) fall within the period 1997\u20132021, (2) report at a country level\nor higher and (3) include all major cereals grown within the country/region.\nFor crop residue production there is close agreement between our estimate and literature values. On a global\nscale _Smil et al_ . [67] estimated 2500 Tg of cereal residue production in 1997, _Lal et al_ . [13] 2800 Tg in 2001 and _Shinde_\n_et al_ . [18] 3860 Tg in 2020. These values can be compared with our estimates of 2930, 2930 and 3900 Tg in the\nrespective years. At the country and regional scale, Fig. 3a shows a comparison between this study and literature [11][,][13][,][15][,][38][,][40][,][41][,][60][\u2013][63][,][68][\u2013][75] = 0.96.\n. Linear regression analysis gives a coefficient of best fit of 0.98 with r [2]\nData concerning fractional crop-residue usage is even sparser than that for crop-residue production. A linear\nregression analysis comparing our study with literature values [9][,][11][,][40][,][60][\u2013][63][,][65][,][68][\u2013][71][,][73][,][75][\u2013][80] results in a coefficient of\nbest fit of 1.05 and r [2] = 0.70 (see Fig. 3b), suggesting good agreement.\nOne point that stands out in Fig. 3b is that burnt fractions are typically higher in the literature than in our\nstudy. For example, on a global scale the FAO estimates that 10\u201311% of rice, wheat and maize residues are burnt [9],\nwhile we find 5\u20138%. Literature estimates for China range from 9% [9] to 27% [68] and for India from 9% [9] to 20% [79] .\nThis can be compared to our estimates, derived from satellite data, of 2\u20135% in China and 5\u20137% in India. It is not\nclear whether this discrepancy results from satellite data not capturing all fires or from methodological problems\nwith other approaches, such as farmer surveys [78] .\n\n\n**Data gaps.** There is significant scope to further improve our estimates of crop residue usage via improvements in the input data. Here we discuss which improvements would have the highest priority.\n\n\n_Crop residue production._ Estimates of crop residue production fit well with the literature (see Fig. 3), but could\nbe further improved by better spatial and temporal resolution (harvest indices) or fitting empirical functions\nto larger measurement datasets (exponential and linear approaches). However, this is not a high priority for\nimproving our crop residue dataset.\n\n\n_Animal usage._ Improving the spatial and temporal resolution of residue feed fractions and feed conversion\nratios is the most obvious way to improve estimates of crop residue use for livestock feed. Since this is a significant use of crop residues, especially in poorer countries, this would better constrain what fraction of crop\nresidues are left for all other uses.\n\n\n_Burning._ As discussed above, literature values for agricultural biomass burning vary significantly between\nthose derived from satellite data and those from other sources (which themselves have significant variation).\nFinding a way to improve the consistency of these estimates would be a priority.\n\n\nScientific **Data** | _(2023) 10:685_ [| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02587-0) 6\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificdata/ www.nature.com/scientificdata\n\n\n**Fig. 3** Comparison to literature values for residue production and fractional residue usage. ( **a** ) Cereal residue\nproduction at country and regional level (see Supplementary Table 1). The solid line is a linear regression fit\n(r [2] = 0.96) and the dashed line a 1:1 line. ( **b** ) Fractional usage of cereal residues at country and regional level (see\nSupplementary Table 2). The point colour shows the usage type, the solid line is a linear regression fit (r [2] = 0.70)\nand the dashed line a 1:1 line.\n\n\n_Other off field uses._ There is a lack of global data for crop residue usage for domestic fuel, construction, biofuels\netc. The existence of such a dataset would significantly improve our estimates of crop residue management.\n\n\n_Left on field._ The fraction of residues left on the field also lacks global data. However, even in the absence of\nsuch a dataset, improvements in data for off-field usage would allow on-field usage to be better constrained, and\nwould remove the need for imposing minimum and maximum limits.\n\n\n**Code availability**\n[The codes used to generate the dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/record/7843730#.ZEIxAC0Rq3I](https://zenodo.org/record/7843730#.ZEIxAC0Rq3I) [81] .\n\n\nReceived: 21 April 2023; Accepted: 21 September 2023;\nPublished: xx xx xxxx\n\n\n**References**\n1.

Its tenacity,\ndespite its harmful consequences for air quality, soil\nhealth, and the climate is a testament to its convenience\nand acceptance among farmers across a wide range of\nfarming systems and agroclimatic zones. Burning is so\nbroadly perceived as being natural that even its immediate toxicity is generally overlooked. Overall, there is\nno greater source of primary fine carbonaceous particles\nthan biomass burning, and it is the second largest source\nof trace gases in the atmosphere. Yet while the polluting\neffects of burning are seldom a concern of agricultural\nproducers, the act of burning often defies farmers\u2019 own\nunderstanding of the multiple benefits of biomass residues, which include nourishing and improving soils.\nThat said, the embrace in the past two decades of alternatives such as no-till farming on a fairly wide scale\nin parts of Europe, Asia, and especially the Americas,\ndemonstrates that change is possible with the right mix\nof public sector support and regulation.\n\n### **Nature and Magnitude of the Problem**\n\nAround the globe, in farming systems large and small,\nburning is one of the most commonly used methods for\nremoving crop residues after harvest. It is particularly\nprevalent following the cultivation of maize, but is also\npracticed with rice, wheat, sugar cane, and other crops\n(see figure 2). Burning is also a common way of preparing lands for cultivation after they have been fallowed.\nIn aggregate terms, China, India, and the United\nStates are the top burners of crop residues, followed by\nBrazil, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation. In relative\nterms, however, Africa is home to some of the most intensive rates of residue burning per hectare of harvested\nland. It is also the region where burning is growing the\nfastest. Among the top 20 burners (in aggregate terms),\nMexico and Tanzania stand out as the most intensive\n\nburners, followed by Brazil, the United States, and Nigeria. And over the past decades, burning has progressed\nsignificantly in countries including Brazil, Indonesia,\nThailand, India, and China (see figure 3). [1]\n\nTo put the above in perspective, however, crop resi\n\n\n**Figure 1:** Field Burning in the U.S. Great Plains\n\n\n_**Source:**_ \u00a9 NewsNetNebraska.\n\n\ndue burning represents only a small fraction of overall,\nagriculture-related open burning of biomass (see box 1\nand figures 4, 5 and 6). With regard to black carbon contributions, for instance, the burning of crop residues is\nestimated to represent only around 5 percent of overall\nopen burning emissions (Bond et al. 2013).2 This note\nfocuses primarily on crop residue burning because it is\nunambiguously related to agriculture, and represents a\nsignificant pollution abatement opportunity.\n\n### **Impacts**\n\nThe open burning of biomass releases a range of air\npollutants that are known to contribute to the deterioration of air quality. This has especially harmful effects\non human health and negatively affects crop growth,\nnatural ecosystems, visibility (due to haze), and physical\ninfrastructure. The key pollutant from a human health\nperspective is particulate matter (coarse particles of 2.5\nto 10 microns, and fine particles of 2.5 microns or less),\nthe impacts of which are mostly local and modulated by\nits concentration, by population density and exposure,\nand weather conditions. Other local air pollutants that\nresult from biomass burning include carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen\noxides (NOx), ammonia (NH 3 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ),\ncarcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\n(PAHs), and multiple other toxic compounds. Short- and\n\n\n\n**1** These rankings are based on Food and Agriculture Organization estimates of kilograms of biomass burnt, and do not take\ninto account all-important emissions factors.\n**2** Open burning is the largest source of global black carbon emissions.\n\n\n_This note was written by Emilie Cassou. Full references and acknowledgments are available online._\n\n\n## Agricultural Pollution Field Burning\n\n\n\nlong-term exposures to particulate matter and air pollutants more generally are strongly associated with a\nrange of health responses including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and premature death.\nIn crops, ground level ozone (formed when NOx, CO,\nand VOCs react with sunlight) can reduce photosynthesis and prohibit plant growth. Acid rain resulting from\nthe emission of SOplants, affect soils, and corrode urban structures. 2 and NOx is also known to damage\nBiomass burning also releases several climate pollutants, including the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon\ndioxide (COand fine particles known as black carbon. The effects of 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and methane (CH 4 ), [3]\nthese and other co-emitted species on climate are variable and complex. [4] Schematically, however, there are\ntwo major and unambiguous ways in which biomass\nburning contributes to climate change. One is a longterm warming effect linked primarily to CO 2 emissions,\nthough also to other GHGs, from deforestation and other forms of land conversion during which biomass is\nburnt and not fully replaced. The other is a short-term\nwarming effect attributed to the emission of black carbon from the burning of biomass in relative proximity to\nsnow- and ice-covered regions of the planet (see box 2).\nIn addition to polluting, the burning of biomass\namounts to destroying a resource that can be put to valu\n\n\nable uses that range from improving soils to controlling non-point\nsource pollution, and reducing the\nuse of substitute materials or products. Straw is a source of nutrients **5%**\n\n(nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur)\nand organic materials that, when Wheat **23%**\nreturned to the soil through the\nprocess of decomposition, contribute to nutrient cycling and topsoil\nformation. These, along with the use\nof straw to maintain ground cover,\ngenerally improve soil properties, **24%**\nhelping to slow runoff and erosion, Rice, paddy\nenhance nutrient availability and _**Source:**_\nplant growth, and mitigate yield _**Note:**_\nrisk. While burning returns some matter.\nnutrients to the soil and can even\n\nresult in a burst of fertility in the\nshort run, most of the organic material and nutrient content of straw is lost under high temperatures. Burning,\nmeanwhile, can perturb soil pH, moisture, and biota (for\nexample, bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, earthworms,\narthropods, and termites), resulting in imbalances. Beyond the farm gate, renouncing the recycling of biomass\nrepresents a lost opportunity to reduce downstream wa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**3** It also emits precursors to the GHG ozone (O 3 ).\n**4**\nThe burning of \u201crenewable biomass\u201d is generally considered carbon neutral. Even though it can influence the climate for\nyears before it is resequestered, the CO2 emitted in burning biomass is not considered a contributor to long-term climate change\nif the equivalent biomass is regrown, as in crop farming. Burning-related emissions of CH4 and N2O\u2014GHGs that are respectively 25 and 298 times more potent than CO2\u2014do contribute to radiative forcing even when the burnt biomass is replaced;\nhowever, biomass burning-related emissions of these gases are dwarfed by other global sources. Note that burning has also\nbeen found to increase biogenic soil emissions of CH4, N2O, and nitric oxide (NO)\u2014that is, linked to soil microbial activity.\nThe emission of pure black carbon has a potent and immediate (\u201cnear-term\u201d) warming effect on the climate. Depending on its\nsource, however, its warming effect can be countered by co-emitted species such as organic carbon, which can have a cooling\neffect. As a result, the net, near-term effect of burning-related emissions on climate depends on a complex set of circumstances,\nincluding where burning occurs (box 2).\n\n\n## Agricultural Pollution Field Burning\n\n**Figure 4:** Burning Plantations and Rainforests in Indonesia\n\n**Box 1.** What Is\nAgricultural Burning?\n\n\nAgricultural burning refers to any\nopen-air burning of biomass that\nis driven by agriculture and results\nfrom fires set intentionally in\npreparation for farming activities.\nAlthough this is conceptually\nstraightforward, the challenge\nof empirically establishing\nthis causal relationship makes\nagricultural burning exceedingly\ndifficult to define in practice, as\nwell as to measure. Whereas\nthe burning of agricultural\ncrop residues squarely fits the\ndefinition, other forms of open\nburning of biomass, including\nthe combustion of forests,\ngrasslands, and savannah, cannot\nall be traced to agriculture. A\nsmall minority of wildfires are\nprovoked by natural causes\nsuch as lightning, for instance,\nand planned agricultural fires\naccount for \u201conly\u201d 10\u201320 percent\nof open burning (ICCI 2014).\nThe vast majority of open\nburning is believed to result\nfrom the uncontrolled spread of\nagricultural fires.\n\n\n_**Source:**_ \u00a9 EPA/STRINGER (above); \u00a9 Regina Safri/Antara Foto/Reuters (below).\n\n\n\nter pollution linked to soil erosion or the additional use\nof synthetic fertilizers for instance.5 Other valuable uses\nof straw precluded by burning include its use for energy, feed, construction materials, or bioplastics. The value\nof using biomass in these and other cases comes from\ndisplacing other sources of these (such as energy or materials) and associated externalities. In other words, the\nimpact of burning is to not prevent these externalities.\n\n### **Drivers**\n\n\nBurning patterns in the Andes and Himalayas were\nfound to reflect multiple factors, and especially tradition,\nease, timing, weather and location, and the practicality\nof alternatives\u2014the latter being partly determined by\naccess to appropriate tools or markets for biomass residues. Across regions, burning is widely seen as a quick\nand inexpensive way to manage crop residues while preventing pests and diseases. And burning crop residues\ncan indeed be a rapid way to prepare fields for a second\nor third crop\u2014an aspect that matters in certain farming\ncontexts, where time and labor constraints factor into\n\n\n\nfarming decisions. In parts of China, for example, there\nis a short window of typically one to two weeks for the\nremoval of crop residues between harvests. Burning is\noften the preferred method of land preparation in such\ncases. In Russia, a sharp rise in residue burning has been\nlinked to the virtual collapse, since the 1990s, of the country\u2019s livestock sector along with its appetite for stubble.\nIn general, while the cost-benefit reality of burning\nvaries significantly and depends on many factors, burning is widespread because so many farmers perceive it\nto offer multiple benefits\u2014and presumably ones that\noutweigh its costs. At the same time, farmers\u2019 favorable\nperception of burning is partly owed to the fact that they\ndo not factor in the environmental and health costs of\nburning that are felt off-farm\u2014its negative externalities. Meanwhile, in contexts where bans or regulations\non burning are in place, weak enforcement means that\nthere is little disincentive for farmers to carry on with\nthe practice.\nIn parallel, a lack of awareness (that is, a partial\nawareness of the costs and benefits of burning and its\n\n\n\n**5**\nThat said, the retention of straw on fields is often associated with higher reliance on pesticides to control unwanted species\nincluding weeds, termites, and rats. This is not an issue when residues are transformed into biochar, a soil amendment.\n\n\n## Agricultural Pollution Field Burning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Agricultural Pollution Field Burning\n\n\n\nthem purchase or lease the equipment or inputs that are\nrequired. Investment can be further hampered by insecure land tenure, as seen in much of Sub-Saharan Africa\nand parts of Asia. Farmers also often lack the technical\nknowledge and know-how to adopt alternatives, and in\ncertain contexts, collective action or markets are insufficiently developed to help farmers overcome some of\nthese obstacles.\n\nIn addition, culturally produced mental models, social customs, present bias, procrastination, and other sociopsychological factors can play a role in perpetuating\nlong-held practices. Burning, for example, can be held\nin place by the notion that crop residues are a form of\nwaste, rather than a resource, and the customary belief that burning is the least costly way of removing a\ncumbersome waste stream. The idea that crop residues\nare a waste stream can also minimize the feeling of loss\nassociated with burning. The central place of plowing,\nin many farmers\u2019 concept of land-preparation can deter their adoption of residue management practices that\ndo not involve burning (box 3). A tendency to discount\nfuture gains and losses known as present bias can also\ninterfere. In other words, farmers may pursue the shortterm boost in soil fertility that burning offers, even\nwhile knowing full well that soils suffer from high temperatures, the loss of organic matter, and the excessive\namounts of fertilizer that are often applied in compensation. And like all humans, farmers can simply procrastinate, intending to change practices but never actually\nimplementing the change.\n\n### **What Can Be Done?**\n\n\nThere are multiple alternatives to burning, many of\nwhich can be directly valuable to farmers. [6] Staying focused on crop residue burning\u2014the broader question of\nopen burning being beyond the scope of this note\u2014major alternatives involve repurposing residues as ground\ncover, soil amendments (that is, mulch or compost), animal feed, or as feedstock for energy, [7] construction materials, paper products, bioplastics, and other artifacts. All\nof these can take on different forms, scales, and levels of\nsophistication. They can also take place on- or off-farm,\nwith the latter relying on the aggregation of residues\nfrom multiple farms to achieve economies of scale. Offfarm solutions can also involve larger upfront investments, as well as additional costs and complexities associated with moving product around. At the front end,\nresidues need to be collected from multiple farms, and\n\n\n\n**Figure 7:** A Band of Fire Across Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\n_**Source:**_ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), January 30, 2016.\n\n\nat the back end, their byproducts distributed\u2014processes that can involve varying degrees of commodification\nand market transacting.\nHelping any of these become a reality, rests first and\nforemost on supporting the technical feasibility and\neconomic attractiveness of alternatives to burning. Yet\nit also requires that the full range of drivers and barriers be addressed, including hidden costs of switching\npractices, farmer perceptions of crop residues and different possible uses of these, and such factors as present\nbias, action-intention divides, and even sociocultural\nconstructs (that is, mental models or schemas). Thus, a\nrange of instruments are needed to support alternatives\nto burning.\n**Laws and regulations.** Through legal action, burning can be restricted or outright banned. Several U.S.\nstates, for example, use a permitting system to limit\nburning to specific days, times, and atmospheric condi\n\n\n**6**\nBesides alternative uses of biomass, increased combustion efficiency can also reduce burning-related pollution (especially\nparticulates). Meanwhile, reducing the amount of residues that are generated in the first place, while theoretically possible,\noffers more limited options in practice. That said, reducing land clearing is a highly relevant though much larger topic that\nrequires addressing the complex drivers of deforestation.\n**7** The use of crop residues to generate useful energy (for example, biogas, or fuel used in cement production) can mitigate\nburning-related pollution to the extent that burning can occur in more controlled conditions, thus resulting in lower particulate\nand methane emissions. Beyond this, its main benefit is to displace other forms of energy production and any pollutants associated with these.\n\n\n## Agricultural Pollution Field Burning\n\n\n\ntions; and the burning of straw and stubble is outlawed\nin most of the European Union\u2019s member states. Many\nhave been able to manage or curb burning in this way,\nbut evidently, legal action there and elsewhere has varied in effectiveness. In China and Russia, national and\nsubnational bans on burning have yielded particularly\nlimited results. The efficacy of legal measures generally\nrests on multiple nonlegal measures and circumstances,\nincluding efforts to make the law known to farmers, a\nrule-abiding culture, the capacity to detect and punish\nillicit burning, and not least, the alignment of economic incentives and other motivators with the law. Several\nU.S. states use a combination of fines, aerial photography, remote sensing, and tip hotlines for enforcement.\n**Information, knowledge, and innovation** . Various\nforms of information and knowledge are needed to curb\nopen burning. They are needed to support an understanding of, among others: the costs and benefits (both\npublic and private) of burning and its alternatives; the\nexistence and extent of these; legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to them; where, when, and why\nburning is carried out (satellite detection can help up\nto a point); and how to implement alternatives (that is,\ntechnical information). Where farmers\u2019 beliefs about the\nbenefits of burning\u2014or conversely, the inconveniences\n\n\n\n**Figure 8:** No-Till Agriculture in Brazil\n\n\n_**Source:**_ \u00a9 Miguel Altieri.\n\n\nof not burning\u2014are deeply rooted, and even socially\nor culturally reinforced, information alone may or may\nnot counter these where they stand to be rectified. The\nabove underscores the need for multidirectional flows of\nknowledge and information, as well as the importance of\nhow information is framed and delivered. It also points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Agricultural Pollution Field Burning\n\n\n\nto the need for a multiplicity of actors, including but not\nlimited to traditional agricultural extension and advisory services, to be connected and engaged in generating\nand conveying information, knowledge, and technology\nto support alternatives to burning (see box 3). Without\nrobust information and innovation systems in place, efforts to curb open burning are likely to be in vain.\n**Sticks, carrots, and nudges** . In the Andes prior to the\narrival of the Spanish and the introduction of the plow,\nthe practice of burning fields carried a penalty of death\nbecause it damaged the soil, the lifeblood of high agricultural yields, reports a 2015 report by the International\nCryosphere Climate Initiative. Today, gentler approaches to advocacy and enforcement are more in vogue\u2014instruments such as fines, taxes, subsidies, and behavioral\ninterventions known as nudges that ultimately let farmers decide for themselves. Whether or not they accompany legal action, these instruments can be used to correct\nexternalities (that is, to expose farmers to the full costs\n\n\n\nand benefits of burning and its alternatives), and even\nto overcome sociopsychological barriers. For example, if\nit can be detected, burning can carry a fine, and alternative uses such as no-till, composting, and biogas production can be encouraged through concessional credit\n(for example, for the production or purchase of equipment), tax incentives (for example, for compost or biogas\nproduction), and supportive public investments. The effectiveness of different instruments is highly contextual\nand can be unrelated to their cost. The convenience of a\n\nresidue pickup service, the persuasiveness of a community-based enforcement system, or even the influence of\nrole models, may be more effective at dissuading burning than a cash incentive or fine. In sum, the complexity,\npersistence, and context specificity of the burning challenge needs to be mirrored by patient forms of public\nsector support that enable technological as well as social\ninnovation\u2014involving, serving, and motivating stakeholders at every level.\n\n\n",

(2019): Balance of potassium in two long-term field experiments\nwith different fertilization treatments. Plant Soil Environ, 65: 225\u2013232.\n\n\n**Abstract** : Balance of potassium (K) was observed in long-term stationary field experiments (21 years) at two sites with\ndifferent soil and climatic conditions (Luvisol, Cambisol). The following crops were rotated within the trial: potatoeswinter wheat-spring barley. All three crops were grown each year. The trial comprised 6 treatments: (1) no fertilization;\n(2) farmyard manure; (3) half dose of farmyard manure + nitrogen (N) in mineral nitrogen fertilizers; (4) mineral\nnitrogen fertilizers; (5) NPK in mineral fertilizers; (6) straw of spring barley + N in mineral nitrogen fertilizers. The\nrecovery rate of potassium from farmyard manure by crops was 24\u201326%, from mineral fertilizers it was 27\u201352%.\nDifferent fertilization intensities were manifested by significant differences in the content of exchangeable K in soil.\nChanges in non-exchangeable K (K ne ) were recorded only at the Luvisol site (850 mg K ne /kg), but not at the Cam\u00ad\nbisol site (3000 mg K ne /kg). The maximum negative balance (\u20132376 kg K/ha/21 years) was recorded at the mineral\nnitrogen fertilization treatment.\n\n\n**Keywords** : farmyard manure; mineral fertilizers; potatoes; wheat, barley; bioavailable K; non-exchangeable K\n\n\n\nThe total potassium (K) content in soils is in the\nrange 0.01% to 4% and usually oscillates around\nca 1%. To determine the optimum content of bio\u00ad\navailable K in soil, various methods may be used.\nIn past, it was especially the Egner-Riehm method\n(Egn\u00e9r et al. 1960). In the Czech Republic, the official\nmethod for agricultural soils analyses nowadays is\nthe Mehlich 3 method (Mehlich 1984, Madaras and\nLipavsk\u00fd 2009, Schroder et al. 2009, Kulh\u00e1nek et\nal. 2014, Madaras and Koubov\u00e1 2015). Binner et al.\n(2017) used the CaCl 2 /DTPA (CAT) extraction to\ndetermine the optimum content of bioavailable K in\nsoil; yet, this method is suitable mostly for garden\nsubstrates analyses. To determine exchangeable po\u00ad\ntassium (K ex ), 1 mol/L ammonium acetate solution\nwas used (Blake et al. 1999, Liu et al. 2010, Madaras\net al. 2014). However, plants do not uptake only po\u00ad\ntassium from the soil solution and exchangeable K.\nThey are able to absorb also some part of the non\n\n\nexchangeable K (K ne ) (Hinsinger and Jaillard 1993).\nIn the plant rhizosphere, a zone poor in K is formed.\nAs a consequence, plants excrete H [+] to the rhizos\u00ad\nphere (Steingrobe and Claasen 2000), which results\nin release of non-exchangeable K. To determine\nnon-exchangeable K, boiling 1 mol/L HNO 3 ex\u00ad\ntraction is often used followed by subtracting of\nNH OAc-determined K from the obtained values\n4 (ex)\n(Srinivasarao et al. 2014, Das et al. 2018, Kitagawa\net al. 2018). As reported by Liu and Bates (1990),\nthe content of non-exchangeable K provides good\ninformation about the amount of plant-available K.\nA significant positive correlation with fixed am\u00ad\nmonium ion strongly supports the hypothesis that\nnon-exchangeable K is bound mainly at boundaries\nof the clay minerals of the 2:1 types, mica and ver\u00ad\nmiculite (Brouder 2011). The fact that a significant\ncorrelation was not determined between the content\n\nof non-exchangeable K and clay particles supports\n\n\n\nSupported by the European Regional Development Fund \u2013 Project NutRisk Centre, Project No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_\n\n019/0000845.\n\n\n**225**\n\n\n_Original Paper_ _Plant, Soil and Environment, 65, 2019 (5): 225\u2013232_\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.17221/109/2019-PSE\n\n\n\nthe hypothesis that the clay mineral type is more\nimportant than the total content of clay particles\n(Kitagawa et al. 2018). The authors further suggest\ndetermining not only exchangeable K but also nonexchangeable K, which enables a complex view of\nthe potassium issue, especially at insufficient K fer\u00ad\ntilization (risk management) and resulting K deficit\nin agricultural soils.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the potassium\nbalance and related changes in soils at different ferti\u00ad\nlization treatments. Long-term field experiments were\ncarried out at two different sites. The crop rotation used\nin the experiment corresponds well with the intensive\nfarming systems used in the Czech Republic (CR).\nThis research is also important from the viewpoint\nof the long-term sustainable soil management in CR,\nwith respect to the fact that annual potassium doses\nin mineral fertilizers for more than 20 years have been\nonly 5\u20136 kg K/ha agricultural soil.\n\n\n**MATERIAL AND METHODS**\n\n\nThe trials were established in 1996 at two sites\n\nwith different soil-climatic conditions: Hn\u011bv\u010deves\n\nand Humpolec (Table 1). Within the trials, three\ncrops were rotated in the following order: potatoes,\nwinter wheat, spring barley. Each year all of the crops\nwere grown. The trial comprised 6 treatments: (1) no\nfertilization (control); (2) farmyard manure (FYM 1);\n(3) half dose of farmyard manure + nitrogen (N) in\nmineral nitrogen fertilizers (FYM 1/2); (4) mineral\nnitrogen fertilizers (N); (5) NPK in mineral fertiliz\u00ad\ners (NPK); (6) straw of spring barley + N in mineral\nnitrogen fertilizers (N + ST) (\u010cern\u00fd et al. 2010).\nOrganic fertilizers \u2013 farmyard manure and straw (ST)\nwere always applied in autumn (October) to potatoes.\nMineral phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were\napplied to each crop in autumn; mineral nitrogen\nfertilizers were applied to potatoes and spring barley\nin spring prior to the crop establishment. In the case\nof winter wheat, the nitrogen dose was divided into\nhalves, the first one was applied at BBCH 21, the\nsecond one at BBCH 31\u201332. The application rate\nof mineral nitrogen was 140 kg N/ha for wheat and\n70 kg N/ha for spring barley; at FYM 1/2 treatment,\nN was applied at the rate of 115 kg N/ha for wheat\nand 50 kg N/ha for barley. The NPK treatment of\nwinter wheat and spring barley included phosphorus\nat a rate of 30 kg P/ha (triple super phosphate) and\npotassium at a rate of 100 kg K/ha (60% potassium\nsalt). At the other treatments, the dosage of phospho\u00ad\n\n\n**226**\n\n\n\nrus (P) and K depended on the content of nutrients\nin the applied organic fertilizers (Table 2).\n\nSoil analyses were always proceeded with air-dried\nsoil samples (\u2264 2 mm; 0\u201330 cm depth; four replica\u00ad\ntions). For the purposes of this manuscript, soil\nsamples taken up in the year 1996 were analysed in\ndetail (autumn, before experiment establishing) and\nat the end of 7 [th] crop rotation, shortly after plant\nharvest in 2017. The data evaluated here are based\n\nonly on the results of the soils taken up from the\nplots with spring barley.\n\nAll plants were harvested after reaching the maturity\nstage every year of the experiment to get the yield\ndata. Samples of barley and wheat grain and straw as\nwell as potato tubers were dried at 40\u00b0C and subse\u00ad\nquently proceeded with dry decomposition (Mader et\nal. 1998). The potassium content was measured due\nto the atomic adsorption spectrometry (AA280FS,\nAgilent Technologies, Mulgrave, Australia).\n\nCaCl 2 /DTPA (CAT) extraction (CSN EN 13651, 2001).\nFor this procedure, 3.00 g of soil sample was weighed\ninto 50 mL tubes. To all samples was applied 30 mL\nsolution of 0.01 mol/L CaCl and 0.01 mol/L 0.002\n2\ndiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). The solu\u00ad\ntion was shaken for 1 h on a horizontal shaker.

The solu\u00ad\ntion was shaken for 5 min on a horizontal shaker and\n\nsubsequently filtered. Potassium content in extracts\nwas measured by the ICP-OES.\n\nAmmonium acetate extraction (hereinafter NH 4 OAc)\nwas realized due to modified procedure by Haby et\nal. (1990). Soil samples (3.00 g) were extracted with\n30 mL 1 mol/L ammonium acetate solution at pH 7.00.\nThe soil solution slurry was shaken for 2 h, and the\nsolution was separated from the solid by centrifuga\u00ad\ntion. The addition of excess NH 4+ to the soil displaces\n\nthe rapid exchangeable potassium from the exchange\nsites of the soil particles. The concentrations of K were\nsubsequently analysed by the ICP-OES.\n\n\n\nBoiling HNO 3 extraction (Helmke and Sparks 2000)\nwas following: 2.5 g of finely ground soil sample was\nheated with 25 mL of 1 mol/L HNO 3 in an Erlenmeyer\nflask on a hot plate for 10 min after boiling started.\nAfter cooling for 5 min, the sample was filtrated and\nthe extract was diluted to 100 mL with 0.1 mol/L\n\nHNO .

At the Hn\u011bv\u010deves\nsite, higher yields of cereals were recorded (grain:\nwheat \u2013 7.07 t dry matter/ha; barley \u2013 4.54 t dry\nmatter/ha) compared to the Humpolec site (grain:\nwheat \u2013 6.29 t dry matter/ha, barley \u2013 3.83 t dry\nmatter/ha). Higher yields of potatoes were recorded\nat the Humpolec site (7.82 t dry matter/ha) than at\nthe Hn\u011bv\u010deves site (7.40 t dry matter/ha). The con\u00ad\ntents of potassium in wheat grain (0.46\u20130.48% K)\nand barley (0.37\u20130.38% K) were identical at both sites.\nSignificantly greater differences were obtained in\nthe K content in straw: (Hn\u011bv\u010deves: wheat 0.88% K,\nbarley 0.98% K; Humpolec: wheat 1.03% K, barley\n1.18% K); and differences were recorded for K content\nin potato tubers (Hn\u011bv\u010deves: 1.84% K, Humpolec:\n2.15% K). Even though the contents of bioavailable\npotassium in soil at the Humpolec site were lower,\nreported K uptake by plants was higher \u2013 by 348 kg\nK/ha on average for all variants and the period of\n21 years. This difference was probably caused by\nhigher potato yield and also by higher precipitation\n\n\n\nand its regular distribution throughout the vegeta\u00ad\ntion period, which might have a positive influence\non the K uptake. Table 3 shows the positive balance\n(inputs minus outputs) only at the variant fertilized\nwith manure. The highest negative balance (\u20132376 kg\nK/ha) was obtained at fertilization with mineral ni\u00ad\ntrogen at the Humpolec site. Negative balance was\ncalculated also for the NPK fertilization, with average\napplication dose of 90 kg K/ha/year. Neither regular\nstraw incorporation influenced the K balance. The\nutilization of K from manure at the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site\n\nwas 26%, at the Humpolec site it was 24%. In case\nof the NPK fertilization it was 52% (Hn\u011bv\u010deves) and\n27% (Humpolec). There is a clear tendency to higher\nK utilization at soils with higher sorption capac\u00ad\nity, which complies with the results of Blake et al.\n(1999). Higher K utilization at mineral fertilization\nmay be caused by lower dose of K applied compared\nto manure treatments. At lower application doses,\ntheir utilisation is generally better.

These authors explain this as a result\nof K not strongly sorbed in manure.\n\n**Content of bioavailable K** . Results obtained using\nthe Mehlich 3 extraction agent are given in Figure 1.\nAt both sites, statistically significant differences were\nrecorded among individual variants, in compliance\nwith the K fertilization intensity. At the Hn\u011bv\u010deves\nsite, the average value of all treatments reached 200 mg\nK/kg, i.e. by 31% more compared to the Humpolec\nsite \u2013 157 mg K/kg. As to the official assessment\nof K pool in the plough layer in the CR for loamy\nsoils, it is ranked in the category \u2018satisfactory pool\u2019\nor \u2018good pool\u2019 \u2013 based on the variant (Smatanov\u00e1\nand Su\u0161il 2018). It may be presumed that even in\nthe control variant the yields were not influenced\nby the lack of N.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, manure application resulted\nin a significant increase of the exchangeable K con\u00ad\ntent. Liu et al. (2010) reported similar results in the\nlong-term experiments. Significantly lowest contents\n\n\n\nwere obtained at variants without K fertilization.\n\nComparison of both sites shows significantly higher\ncontent (by 34.6%) at the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site (with average\nvalues of 206 mg K/kg) than in Humpolec (153 mg\nK/kg). If the values are recalculated to the level of satu\u00ad\nration of the sorption complex with potassium, this\nparameter almost does not differ for the two sites \u2013\nit is 4.56% in Hn\u011bv\u010deves and 4.37% in Humpolec\n(Table 4); it is given by the differences between the\ntotal values of the cation exchangeable capacity\n(Hn\u011bv\u010deves: 116 mmol + /kg, Humpolec: 90 mmol + /kg).\nThe content > 3.50% cation exchange capacity (CEC) is\nconsidered as satisfactory for these soils. Comparison\nof the K values at both extraction agents (Mehlich 3/\nNH 4 OAc) shows certain similarity. For the Hn\u011bv\u010deves\nlocation, the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient be\u00ad\n\ntween the K contents determined with Mehlich 3 and\n\nNH 4 OAc was 0.989 at the significance level _P_ < 0.001;\nfor the Humpolec location it was 0.958. The relation\u00ad\nship between K in ammonium acetate and Mehlich\n3 is: _y_ = 0.974 _x_ + 7.6145, _R_ [2] = 0.9772 (Hn\u011bv\u010deves),\n_y_ = 0.9505 _x_ + 5.6757, _R_ [2] = 0.9815 (Humpolec). It is\nthus probable that mainly exchangeable potassium\nis released at the Mehlich 3 extraction. High agree\u00ad\nment of these methods is, to a certain extent, given\nby the fact that the study evaluates corresponding\nlong-term field trials. At ordinary agricultural soils,\nthe agreement would probably be lower.\n\nCAT extraction revealed significantly lower K con\u00ad\ntent compared to other extraction methods (Figure 3).\nThe average content for all variants was 110 mg K/kg\nat the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site and 120 mg K/kg at the\nHumpolec site. It is interesting that the ratio of the\nvalues (Hn\u011bv\u010deves/Humpolec) is opposite compared\nto the Mehlich 3 and NH 4 OAc methods, which is\nprobably caused by different character of clay parti\u00ad\n\n\n\nHn\u011bv\u010deves Humpolec\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n166\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n180\n\n\n160\n\n\n140\n\n\n120\n\n\n100\n\n\n80\n\n\n60\n\n\n40\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n180\n\n\n160\n\n\n140\n\n\n120\n\n\n100\n\n\n80\n\n\n60\n\n\n40\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCont FYM 1 FYM 1/2 N NPK N + St\n\n\n\nCont FYM 1 FYM 1/2 N NPK N + St\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

(2017) stated that\n\nthis method was sensitive at variants with added\n\nclay sorbents of the smectite type.\n\n**Content of non-exchangeable K** . Contents of\nnon-exchangeable potassium are shown in Figure 4.\nBoth sites significantly differ; contents were in the\nrange of 816 to 927 mg K/kg at the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site\nin contrast to the interval 2908\u20133068 mg K/kg at the\nHumpolec site. There is a significant influence of the\nsoil-forming materials. Parent material of Cambisol\n(Humpolec) is paragneiss; in the process of material\nchanges (weathering) potassium is released in signifi\u00ad\ncant amounts. On the contrary, Luvisol (Hn\u011bv\u010deves)\non loess has markedly lower potential to release\nK. Blake et al. (1999) observed the changes in the\ncontent of non-exchangeable K at long-term field\ntrials sites. The highest contents were reported for\nBad Lauchstadt: 1810\u20132196 mg K/ha, whereas lower\ncontents were reported for Rothamsted: 650\u20131442 mg\nK/ha. This corresponds with the range recorded at the\nHn\u011bv\u010deves site. High contents approaching 3000 mg\nK/kg were published by \u00d8gaard and Krogstad (2005)\nfor selected soils in Norway. Figure 4 shows that\ncompletely different fertilization for the period of\n21 years did not have a significant impact on the\nchanges of non-exchangeable K at the Humpolec site,\nnot even at variants unfertilized with K in the long\nterm. At comparison of K amount obtained at harvest\n(1663\u20132376 kg K/ha) and the content of non-ex\u00ad\nchangeable K in the plough layer (ca 12 500\u201312 800 kg\nK/ha) it is clear that the effect of fertilization on the\nchanges in the non-exchangeable K may not have\nbeen manifested.\n\n\nAt the Hn\u011bv\u010deves site, a significant tendency to\ndecrease the non-exchangeable K content was ob\u00ad\n\n\n**230**\n\n\n\nserved at the variants without K fertilization. The\n\ncontent of non-exchangeable K in the plough layer was\nca 3600\u20133800 kg/ha, which is comparable with the\nK values at harvest (1124\u20132111 kg K/ha). Moreover,\nnon-exchangeable K was also important for replen\u00ad\nishing plant-available K in soil at this site. A decrease\nof the non-exchangeable K in the long-term trials\nat the unfertilized variants compared to the manure\napplication was reported also by Blake et al. (1999)\nand Srinivvasarao et al. (2014). Furthermore, it must\nbe stressed that not all of the non-exchangeable K\nmay be used by plants, as it is released continuously\nduring many years, as was reported by Moritsuka et\nal. (2002). Non-exchangeable K release depends on\nmany factors, such as K concentration in soil solu\u00ad\ntion, concentration of other cations and pH value\n(Wang et al. 2011).\n\nTable 5 summarizes the results of individual tested\n\nmethods related to the boiling HNO 3 extraction. At\nthe Hn\u011bv\u010deves site, the average content of 1069 mg\nK/ha was obtained, whereas at the Humpolec site it\nwas 3167 mg K/kg.

The comparison\nof the Mehlich 3 and NH OAc methods shows that\n4\ntheir extraction strength is similar. The values ob\u00ad\ntained using the CAT extraction were only 60\u201365%\ncompared to the previous methods.\n\n**Changes in K in 1996/2017** . The archive samples\nfrom 1996 were analysed (for each parcel individu\u00ad\nally) and the results were compared with the 2017\nanalysis. The differences in the potassium content in\nthe plough layer (kg K/ha) are reported in Table 6.\nK amount in the plough layer decreased in all the un\u00ad\nfertilized variants. The highest decrease is recorded at\nvariant with mineral N fertilization. The comparison\nof negative values in the potassium balance (Table 3)\nand changes in Table 6 shows that the values in Table 6\nare lower compared to the balance only. It can be\nexplained by continuous mobilisation of potassium\nfrom the non-exchangeable bonds and further also by\nnot considering the K content in the subsoil, which is\nalso a significant potassium source for plants.\n\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n\nBinner I., Dultz S., Schellhorn M., Schenk M.K.

This chapter presents an alternative framework to depict soil K pools. The framework distinguishes between micas and\nfeldspars as K-bearing primary minerals, based on the presence of K in interlayer\npositions or three-dimensional framework structures, respectively; identifies a pool\nof K in neoformed secondary minerals that can include fertilizer reaction products;\nand replaces the \u201cexchangeable\u201d K pool with a pool defined as \u201csurfaceadsorbed\u201d K, identifying where the K is located and the mechanism by which it is\n\n\nM.

Bell et al.\n\n\nheld rather than identification based on particular soil testing procedures. In this\nchapter, we discuss these K pools and their behavior in relation to plant K acquisition\nand soil K dynamics.\n\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\n\nTraditionally, soil potassium (K) has been depicted as occurring in four pools\u2014soil\nsolution K, exchangeable K, interlayer K, and mineral or structural K (Barber 1995).\nVarious publications have estimated the relative sizes of these traditional K pools\n(for example, \u00d6born et al. 2005; Hinsinger 2006) with K in primary minerals\n\n\u2013\n(90 98% of total soil K) the dominant form of soil K. The K most readily available\n\n\u2013 \u2013\nfor plant uptake [exchangeable K (1 2%) and solution K (0.1 0.2%)] represents\nonly a very small fraction of the total soil K, although interlayer K in secondary\n\n\u2013\nminerals can also be a significant proportion (1 10%, depending on mineralogy).\nHowever, this terminology creates some confusion for a number of reasons. In\nparticular, exchange reactions between the solid and the soil solution phases can\nresult in reversible K movement to or from both surface and interlayer positions of\nclay minerals, while interlayer K can be found in both primary minerals (e.g., micas)\nas well as in secondary minerals (e.g., illite). Furthermore, soils with a history of\nrepeated applications of high-K waste materials and/or high rates of band-applied\ncompound fertilizers containing K may also contain neoformed secondary K minerals with poorly understood behavior in terms of K bioavailability.\nThese considerations have led to the development of an alternative framework to\ndepict soil K pools (Fig. 7.1). There are three key characteristics of this conceptual\ndiagram that differ from the traditional four-pool model. The first is the distinction\nbetween micas and feldspars as K-bearing primary minerals, which is based on the\npresence of K in interlayer positions between mineral layers in phyllosilicate minerals (micas and partially weathered micas) or in the three-dimensional structural\nframeworks of tectosilicates (feldspars). The flux from structural K in feldspars and\nmicas to soil solution K is unidirectional. However, the flux from interlayer K to soil\nsolution K can be bidirectional for partially weathered micas. The second characteristic is the identification of a pool of K in neoformed secondary minerals that can\ninclude fertilizer reaction products. The third characteristic is the replacement of the\n\u201cexchangeable\u201d K pool with a pool defined as \u201csurface-adsorbed\u201d K. The \u201csurfaceadsorbed K\u201d concept clearly identifies where the K is located and the mechanism by\nwhich it is held. It avoids ascribing possible locations (surfaces, wedge, and\ninterlayer positions) on the basis of particular soil testing procedures.\nQuantification of K in these different K pools, particularly in relation to K\navailable for plant acquisition in time frames relevant to individual crop or pasture\n[seasons (i.e., K bioavailability, Chap. 4), is challenging. This is due to both the](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n[limitations of current diagnostic soil testing methods (Chap. 8) and the need to](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nconsider crop, season, and soil-specific factors that regulate root dynamics, rhizo[sphere conditions, and soil moisture dynamics (Chap. 4).

Unless mineral soils have been\nrecently fertilized or amended with manure, soil solution K concentrations are\ntypically low (100\u20131000 \u03bcM) because of selective adsorption of K by some clay\nminerals (Hinsinger 2006). Leaching losses of K are usually low, but they may occur\n[when K inputs exceed the sum of K holding capacity and plant uptake (Chap. 3) or](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_3)\nwhere preferential flow of water occurs.\nAs the monovalent cation, K [+] in the soil solution is the form taken up directly by\nplants (Sparks 1987), with concentrations determined by reactions with solid-phase\nforms of soil K and with other cations on the exchange complex and in the soil\nsolution, and by soil moisture content (Sparks and Huang 1985). The small amount\nof K [+] present in the soil solution in all except recently fertilized soils suggests that\nthe rate of K uptake from this pool is likely to be limited as solution K [+] stocks are\n\n\n166 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nrapidly depleted (Barrow 1966). Therefore, factors that control solution K concentration ultimately influence uptake rates. These factors include the rates of K\ndiffusion in the soil solution from surrounding, undepleted soil, and the quantity\nof readily desorbable K on the exchange complex (Evangelou et al. 1994; Barber\n1995). The moderating effects of other major soil solution cations (Ca, Mg, and Na)\non the kinetics of soil solution K replenishment and subsequent uptake of K by plant\nroots have been the subject of extensive research, reviewed by Sparks (1987) and\nEvangelou et al. (1994). This research has shown that the complex interactions\namong soil solution chemistry, rooting density, and the subsequent competition for\nK uptake make extrapolation beyond the specific conditions of individual experiments difficult (Barber 1995). There is, however, a general recognition of the\nimportance of cation exchange capacity (CEC) on both the ability of the soil to\nbuffer soil solution K (sometimes measured as buffer capacity, BC K ) and also on K\nsupply to the root (Barber 1981). As CEC increases, there is less K available for plant\nuptake, even in soils with the same concentrations of exchangeable K (Bell et al.\n2009). These relationships have currently not been well defined.\n\n\n7.3 Surface-Adsorbed Potassium\n\n\nSurface-adsorbed K is the quantity of K associated with negatively charged sites\non: soil organic matter; planar surfaces of phyllosilicate minerals; and surfaces of\niron and aluminum oxides. However, the location of those charge surfaces and the\nspecificity of those sites for K varies greatly. An example of the contrasting sites was\nprovided by Mengel (1985) for a weathered grain of mica (Fig. 7.2). The p-position\nis a site on the planar surfaces of phyllosilicate minerals where hydrated K [+] is\nadsorbed. In these positions, K ions tend to retain a hydration shell, be weakly and\nnonspecifically bound, and be in rapid dynamic equilibrium with soil solution\nK. Exchange reactions in response to altered soil solution concentrations occur\nvery quickly. For example, cation exchange reactions on montmorillonite have\nbeen measured to be complete in less than 10 [\ufffd][1] s (Tang and Sparks 1993), but\nmodelled to be complete much faster, less than 5 \ufffd 10 [\ufffd][10] s (Bourg and Sposito\n2011). As a result, this K pool is considered to be in a form immediately available for\nmovement into the soil solution in response to depletion by plant root uptake (Barber\n1995).\nPlanar surface sorption sites, along with carboxylate and phenolate groups in soil\norganic matter and negatively charged sites on the surfaces of iron and aluminum\noxides, tend to show a greater affinity for divalent cations like Ca [2+] and Mg [2+]\n\n(Hinsinger 2006). This means that application of soil amendments (lime, limestone,\nor dolomite), or even frequent rainfall or irrigation in well-drained soils, can result in\ndisplacement of surface-adsorbed K from the charged surface by other cations and\npossible loss from the rooting zone through leaching. Other sorption sites illustrated\nin Fig. 7.2, the e- and i-positions, show greater affinity for K and a slower interaction\nwith components of the soil solution. These sites are discussed below.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-position\n\n\nexchangeable\ninterlayer ions\n\n\nmica core\n\n\nvermiculite\n\n\n\np-positions\n\n\nFig. 7.2 Diagrammatic representation of K adsorption positions for mica, a frayed edge of mica,\nand an outer layer where mica has transformed to vermiculite.

Layers carry a net negative charge and are bound together by K [+] ions.\nAway from the edges of the crystal, these K [+] ions do not have a hydration shell.\n\n\n168 M. J.

(adapted from Schulze 1989)\n\n\nThey are dehydrated and occupy the ditrigonal cavities in the tetrahedral sheets\nabove and below them in adjacent 2:1 layers (Fig. 7.3a). Muscovite and biotite are\ntwo common micas. Pure muscovite is a dioctahedral mica in which two-thirds of the\ncation positions in the octahedral sheet are filled with trivalent Al [3+] . Biotite is a\ntrioctahedral mineral in which all the cation positions in the octahedral sheet are\nfilled with divalent cations such as Fe [2+] and Mg [2+] . The negative layer charge in these\nminerals is derived primarily from isomorphic substitution of Al [3+] for Si [4+] in the\ntetrahedral sheets. The layer charge of both muscovite and biotite is close to 1 mol of\ncharge per 10-oxygen formula unit (Thompson and Ukrainczyk 2002).\nDuring mica weathering, the layer charge of these minerals declines and\ninterlayer K leaves from the edges of the particles (Scott and Smith 1967; Barber\n1995; Hinsinger 2006). As the net negative charge in the layers decreases, not only is\nK released from some interlayer positions near the edge of the particles but the space\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 169\n\n\n\nFig. 7.4 An example\nstructure of a potassium\nfeldspar (orthoclase) and the\ntypes of bonds present.\nArrows indicate the\ndesorption of K [+] cations\nfrom their original positions\nat the outer surface of the\n\ntectosilicate structure,\nindicated by circles with\ndotted lines. (adapted from\nFenter et al. 2000)\n\n\n\nWeaker\n\nionic bonds\n\n\nStronger\ncovalent bonds\n\n\n\nbetween the layers opens at those locations (Fig. 7.2). These changes allow for freer\nmovement of other cations into that portion of the interlayer region and facilitate\nexchange reactions. In general, weathering of micas leads to loss of layer charge and\ntransformation to vermiculite, and then to smectite (Wilson 1999; Thompson and\nUkrainczyk 2002) (Fig. 7.4).\nAs micas weather, interlayer adsorption sites become differentiated (Fig. 7.2).\nThe e-position is an interlayer adsorption site where hydrated K [+] is preferentially\nadsorbed and where K [+] can rapidly diffuse short distances out of the crystal lattice\nand into the soil solution. Potassium in this position is rapidly exchangeable with\nNH 4+, and NH 4+ is also preferentially adsorbed at these sites (Bolt et al. 1963;\nMengel 1985). The i-position is an interlayer adsorption site where dehydrated K [+]\n\nis preferentially adsorbed and where K [+] diffuses more slowly into the soil solution.\nA wedge zone is the interlayer volume at the nexus where two adjacent\nphyllosilicate mineral layers separate farther due to solvation forces. A wedge\nsite is an interlayer adsorption site at the point where two adjacent layers begin\nto separate farther due to solvation forces. Wedge sites on illite are most selective\nfor the dehydrated cesium cation (Cs [+] ) but are also selective for dehydrated K [+] (Lee\net al. 2017).\nHinsinger (2006) noted that while adsorption/desorption of K can occur in the\ne-positions in frayed edges of weathered clay minerals, this process was considerably slower than that at the planar surfaces discussed in Sect. 7.3. Even slower\nrelease can occur with K in the i-positions, because the ionic radius of K [+] and its low\nhydration energy allow it to dehydrate and fit perfectly into cavities created by the\nbasal plane of oxygen ions in the tetrahedral sheets of phyllosilicates. While adsorption/desorption reactions may still occur under particular circumstances, they are\nvery slow.\n\n\n170 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nMengel (1985) differentiated K adsorption positions by their Gapon selectivity\ncoefficients. The Gapon coefficient is a factor that quantifies the selectivity for one\nion over another at adsorption sites. The higher the Gapon coefficient is, the greater\nthe selectivity. Using the selectivity for K [+] over Ca [2+] (Bolt et al. 1963), Mengel\n(1985) reported that the Gapon coefficients differed by an order of magnitude\nbetween adsorption positions. The p-positions had the lowest selectivity for K\n(Gapon coefficients less than 10), the e-positions had an intermediate selectivity\n(Gapon coefficients approximately equal to 100), and the i-positions had the highest\nselectivity for K (Gapon coefficients greater than 1000).\nAs a mica weathers, transformations occur within very short distances.\nInterstratification is the occurrence of both high-charge layers of mica and layers\nwith lower charge in the same mineral domain. In phyllosilicate clays, the highcharge, K-bearing core is typically illite, i.e., a clay mica. Core illite layers are often\n\n                                                   continuous with near-edge layers where weathering has lowered the charge suffi\nciently to be classified as vermiculite. The difference in the structural charge of\ndomain cores and of layers near domain edges is usually ignored in the literature, and\nsuch particles are lumped into the term \u201cillites.\u201d Potassium that is held in the core\ninterlayers (i-positions) is not surface-adsorbed, is not exchangeable with ammonium, and is not likely to be bioavailable to plants unless subjected to the unique\n[conditions of the rhizosphere (Chap. 4). Indeed, K](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4) [+] cations in those positions can be\nextremely stable. In contrast, the lower-charge interlayer positions near domain\nedges, e-positions in Fig. 7.2, may retain K from fertilizer amendments and release\nit back slowly to the soil solution. Because the layer charge there is lower than in\nunweathered mica layers, K [+] ions are held less tightly and are more susceptible to\nsubsequent release. It should be noted that both primary micas and the high-charge\ncore of illite domains will yield a 1.0-nm d\u2013spacing in X-ray diffraction patterns. It is\ndifficult to quantitatively differentiate a primary mica from illite by using routine\nX-ray diffraction procedures.\n\n\n7.5 Interlayer Potassium in Secondary Layer Silicates\n\n\nSecondary layer silicates are phyllosilicate minerals that are weathering products\nof primary minerals. The interlayer compositions of these minerals are variable and\ncan contain a variety of cations and quantities of water. Figure 7.3b shows an\nexample structure that represents two different types of secondary minerals important to K behavior in soils: smectite and vermiculite. A key feature of these minerals\nis the presence of hydrated cations in the interlayer. The presence of water facilitates\nthe diffusion of cations in and out of the interlayer, making cation exchange possible.\nSoil tests that rely on cation exchange to measure K will measure some K from\ninterlayers of these minerals.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 171\n\n\n7.6 Structural Potassium in Feldspar and Feldspathoids\n\n\nStructural K in feldspars is the quantity of K in structures of tectosilicate minerals.\nMaking up nearly 31% of the Earth\u2019s crust, feldspars (specifically, orthoclase and\nmicrocline) and feldspathoids (e.g., leucine) represent the dominant form of structural K in many soils, with the quantities in soil determined by the intensity of\nweathering and also erosional and depositional factors (Sparks 1987; Barber 1995).\nWhile feldspars are commonly present in the silt and sand fractions of younger and\nmoderately weathered soils (Sparks 1987), alkali feldspars have also been found in\nthe clay fractions of moderately weathered soils (Huang and Lee 1969).\nThe K in feldspars occurs throughout the mineral structure (Fig. 7.3). In\nK-feldspars, silicon (Si)-oxygen, and aluminum (Al)-oxygen bonds are stronger,\ncovalent bonds, but K is held in the tectosilicate structure by weaker, ionic bonds\n(Fogler and Lund 1975). When feldspars weather, the K in the outer layer of the\nstructure is released first, causing structural relaxation of the remaining bonds in the\nsurrounding structure (Fenter et al. 2000). The result is an irreversible dissolution of\nthe mineral\u2019s silicate framework during weathering (Sparks 1987; Barber 1995;\nHinsinger 2006). While K feldspars can be present in only small quantities or are\ncompletely absent in some strongly weathered soils (Sparks 1987), the rates of\nweathering and subsequent K release may be slowed by the formation of a\nnoncrystalline Si-Al-O skin on the mineral surface (Rich 1972). Rich (1968) found\nthat the rates of K release from feldspars were typically slower than that from micas,\nalthough Song and Huang (1988) noted that this order may be altered in the presence\nof organic acid anions (oxalate and citrate) that can be exuded by roots of some plant\nspecies into their rhizospheres.\nThere is evidence to suggest that feldspars can contribute significant quantities of\nbioavailable K to plants, with these contributions potentially originating from sandsized fractions rather than clay-sized fractions. Examples include the work of Rehm\nand Sorensen (1985), who conducted a 4-year trial that varied fertilizer application\nrates of K and magnesium (Mg) in a factorial combination on an irrigated Valentine\nloamy fine sand with aeolian sand parent material. Application rates of fertilizer K\nranged from 0\u2013269 kg K ha [\ufffd][1] . Based on the levels of ammonium acetate\nextractable K, Rehm and Sorensen expected maize (Zea mays L.) yield to increase\nwhen fertilized with K; however, no increase was observed over the study period.\nThey attributed the lack of maize response to the added K to the presence of\nbioavailable K in feldspars in the fine sand and very fine sand size fractions. Sautter\n(1964) characterized the Valentine soil as having up to 23% K feldspars in the upper\n28 cm (inferred from Fig. 7.1 in that paper). Sadusky et al. (1987) measured K\nrelease rates from three US Atlantic Coastal Plains soils that had high quantities of\nfeldspars in the sand fractions, ranging from 6.7\u201316.0% in the surface horizons and\n8.2\u201324.0% in the subsurface horizons. Potassium release rates were studied for a\n\nperiod of up to 30 days in the presence of both oxalic acid and a cation exchange\nresin. Because the resin provided a continuous sink for K and kept solution K levels\nlower than did the oxalic acid, approximately two orders of magnitude more K were\n\n\n172 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nreleased with the resin than with oxalic acid. Most of the K was released in the first\n16 days (inferred from Fig. 7.1 in that paper). After 30 days, the total quantities of K\nreleased by the resin ranged from 67\u201392 mg K kg [\ufffd][1] soil in the surface horizon\nsamples.\nThis type of evidence suggests that blanket statements about coarser-textured\nsandy soils providing little bioavailable K to plants can be inaccurate. The observations of Niebes et al. (1993) that a substantial portion of K had been extracted by rape\n(Brassica napus L.) grown in the coarse (silt and sand) fractions of soils from two\nlong-term fertilizer experiments in Europe support this conclusion. Despite the short\nduration of this experiment (8 days of plant growth), they found for the coarse silt\nand sand fractions that 80\u2013100% of the bioavailable K was not originating in the\nammonium-exchangeable pool. The mineralogical composition and the K-supplying\npower of a given particle size fraction must be considered, and future K recommendations need to consider the possible contribution of K feldspars.\n\n\n7.7 Neoformed Potassium Minerals\n\n\nNeoformed K minerals are newly formed minerals created from the reaction of soil\nsolution K with other soil solution ions. Neoformed K minerals do not include\n\nprimary or secondary layer silicate minerals, but are considered to be a possible\nbyproduct of fertilizer use in intensive cropping areas, especially where compound\nfertilizers that include K are applied in bands with high in-band concentrations (e.g.,\nthe result of wideband spacings in sugarcane or row crops). Such minerals are\nprobably rare in soils, but they may form under certain conditions.\nAs an example, we consider the neoformation of potassium taranakite\n(K 3 Al 5 H 6 (PO 4 ) 8 \ufffd 18H 2 O) or its noncrystalline analogs. Du et al. (2006) coapplied\nmonocalcium phosphate with KCl on an acid (pH 4.6) soil. They hypothesized that\nsome of the added K displaced Al [3+] from exchange sites, leading to precipitation\nof K, P, and Al as a noncrystalline analog of potassium taranakite. Formation of\npotassium taranakite was also observed by Lindsay (1962) after adding saturated\nsolutions of monocalcium phosphate or monopotassium phosphate to an acidic\n(pH 4.9) Hartsells fine sandy loam soil. The formation of potassium taranakite\nwith only monocalcium phosphate indicates that to form this precipitate, K may\nnot need to be added but simply needs to be present in solution or in a position\n(probably the p-position) where it can be readily displaced into solution by fertilizer\naddition. Potassium taranakite was present at 15 min and 3 h after fertilizer addition,\nbut not after 3 days. When Lindsay added those same saturated fertilizer solutions to\na basic (pH 8.3) Webster silty clay loam soil, no taranakite formed. Acid conditions\nwhere Fe and Al are present are necessary for potassium taranakite formation.\nHow the formation of taranakite or other neoformed minerals changes K bioavailability during the growing season of plants has not been well researched and is\ncurrently not well known.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 173\n\n\n7.8 Fixation and Release of Interlayer Potassium\n\n\nThe processes by which K is adsorbed or desorbed from interlayer positions of\nweathered micas, vermiculite, and high-charge smectite are referred to as fixation\nand release. In potassium fixation, hydrated K [+] ions move to interlayer positions in\nphyllosilicate minerals, then dehydrate as the mineral layers contract. In this\nposition, the K [+] is unavailable to plants. Potassium release is when mineral layers\nexpand, K [+] ions rehydrate, and move to the soil solution, becoming bioavailable to\nplants. In addition to environmental factors such as pH, redox potential and temperature, fixation and release are governed by the soil solution concentrations of K and\ncompeting cations. The actions of plant root uptake (depletion) or fertilizer application (enrichment) determine the net impact of fixation and release on the dynamics of\ninterlayer K (Schneider et al. 2013). The processes of K interlayer fixation have been\nstudied extensively, due to the focus on exchangeable K as a proxy of the pool of soil\nK that is bioavailable to plants and the apparent inefficient use of applied K fertilizer\nin soils where K fixation occurs (e.g., Kovar and Barber (1990)), but there has been\nless research focus on the release process. Sparks (1987), Barber (1995), \u00d6born et al.\n(2005), Hinsinger (2006), and Z\u00f6rb et al. (2014) provide detailed reviews of much of\n[this work (see also Chap. 4).](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\nIn some ways, K fixation can be conceptualized as the reversal of mica\nweathering (Fig. 7.5). When micas weather, their interlayers expand, and K is\nreleased. Even though layer charge declines, there is an increase in CEC because\nmore surface area is available to exchange with cations in extractant solutions used\nto measure CEC. This greater surface area comes from interlayer positions that have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 7.5 Model of the processes of K fixation and release\n\n\n174 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK input \u2013 K output (kg ha [-1] year [-1] )\n\n\nFig. 7.6 Annual change in exchangeable K (exch. K) in response to annual K budgets in several\nlong-term fertilizer trials in Europe. Potassium inputs are from organic and inorganic K fertilizers,\nand K outputs occur in harvested produce. The general lack of equivalent changes in exchangeable\nK in response to surpluses or deficits in K budgets have been interpreted as evidence of K fixation or\nrelease, respectively. (Hinsinger 2002)\n\n\nbecome available for ion exchange upon interlayer hydration and expansion. When\nK is fixed between the layers of expanded 2:1 layer silicates, the layers contract,\ntrapping dehydrated K [+] ions in ditrigonal voids in adjacent tetrahedral sheets. The\ndehydration and contraction of interlayers prevent ion exchange, and an equivalent\ndecrease in CEC is observed. Fixed K becomes nonexchangeable, or at least not\n\n+\nexchangeable with NH 4 in the 1 M ammonium acetate extractant commonly used to\nmeasure CEC and exchangeable cations. For decades, the fixation process has been\nstudied in laboratory settings (Barshad 1948, 1951, 1954; Jackson 1963;\nReichenbach and Rich 1975; Wear and White 1951), and its effects can be observed\nat the field level in some long-term fertilized treatments, for example, at the\nRothamsted site discussed by Blake et al. (1999) and other sites in Europe (Hinsinger\n2002, Fig. 7.6). At the same time, the unfertilized or negative K balance treatments in\nlong-term studies have demonstrated that there can be significant net release of\nnonexchangeable K in unfertilized plots (Velde and Peck (2002), Fig. 7.6). However, whether K was released from feldspars, from primary or partially weathered\nmicas, or from secondary phyllosilicate minerals, or simply depletion of unsampled\nsubsoil layers (Kuhlmann and Barraclough 1987; Prasad 2009), was rarely\ndetermined.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 175\n\n\nPotassium ions, in addition to those of other monovalent cations such as NH 4+,\nrubidium (Rb [+] ), and Cs [+], are all fixed in a similar manner (Barshad 1954; Meunier\nand Velde 2004; \u0160ucha and \u0160ir\u00e1\u0144ov\u00e1 1991), while ions of monovalent sodium (Na [+] )\nand the divalent cations calcium (Ca [2+] ), magnesium (Mg [2+] ), barium (Ba [2+] ), and\nstrontium (Sr [2+] ) are not fixed to any appreciable extent. This is because monovalent\ncations have relatively weak energies of hydration compared to the divalent cations\nand so they are more likely to shed water molecules from the hydration sphere as\nthey enter the charged space of the interlayer region. Furthermore, because of their\nsize, K [+], NH 4+, Rb +, and Cs + ions can be positioned more stably in the ditrigonal\ncavities in the tetrahedral sheet than can other monovalent ions like Na [+] or lithium\n(Li [+] ) (Reichenbach and Rich 1975). Staunton and Roubaud (1997) reported that the\norder of increasing affinity of monovalent cations for montmorillonite and illite was\ngenerally Na < K < NH 4 < Cs, arguing that the strong retention of Cs may be the\nresult of the more covalent nature of the Cs\u2013clay interaction compared to the\nelectrostatic interactions of the other ions.\n\n\n7.8.1 Contractive and Expansive Forces\n\n\nAt the molecular scale, most K fixation by 2:1 layer silicates can be thought of most\nsimply as the force of lattice contraction exceeding the forces of lattice expansion\nwith K [+] ions in the interlayer space (Fig. 7.7). Contraction is a result of the attraction\nof negatively charged sites on the silicate surface for the positively charged cation.\nExpansion occurs when the layer charge is insufficient to overcome the energies of\nhydration of the cations in the interlayer (Hurst and Jordine 1964; Kittrick 1966;\nKaufhold and Dohrmann 2010). The repulsion of the strong dipoles of the oxygen\nions that are fixed in place on the basal planes of the minerals also contribute to\nrepulsion of the layers from one another.\nClay layers may also collapse when there are no interlayer molecules or ions (i.e.,\nwater, metal hydroxyl complexes, organic cations, and molecules) to prevent the\napproach of adjacent layers close enough for van der Waals forces of attraction to\nexceed the forces of expansion. The strength of van der Waals forces lies in the\nproximity of clay layers to each other, and the proximity is controlled by the\ncoulombic force of attraction of interlayer cations for interlayer surfaces. The greater\nthe attraction, the closer the cation is held to the interlayer surface. The closer the\ncation is held, the closer an adjacent clay layer can approach. The closer adjacent\nclay layers become, the stronger van der Waals attractive forces become. When van\nder Waals attractive forces exceed the forces of expansion, the clay layers will\ncollapse. Hence, cations with high energies of hydration and large hydrated ionic\nradii (e.g., Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] ) are not appreciably fixed because it is difficult to\novercome the distance that these hydrated cations place between clay layers and\nthe energy with which they hold onto their surrounding water molecules (Fig. 7.7).\nThe coulombic force of attraction of interlayer surfaces for interlayer cations is a\nfunction of layer charge, charge location, and bond geometries in the layer silicate\n\n\n176 M.

Tetrahedrally derived negative charge is more\neffective than octahedrally derived negative charge at attracting interlayer cations\nas a result of its proximity to the basal layer surface. Similarly, bond geometries,\nparticularly the hydroxyl group orientations in the octahedral sheet that are largely a\nfunction of cationic occupancies in the octahedral sheet, affect the attraction of\ninterlayer cations for interlayer surfaces by controlling how closely interlayer cations\ncan approach negative layer charge sites.\n\n\n7.8.2 Factors Affecting Potassium Fixation and Release\n\n\nSoil mineralogy is the key to understanding K fixation and release because only 2:1\nlayer silicates fix and release K in interlayer positions. Potassium can be fixed by\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 177\n\n\nmica weathering products, i.e., vermiculites and high-charge smectites (Barshad\n1951, 1954, Ranjha et al. 1990, Rich 1968, Martin and Sparks 1985). Some authors\nindicate that K can be fixed by micas per se, but this is not likely. Micas are defined\nby having a high layer charge (near 1 mol of charge per 10-oxygen formula unit).\nOnce the layer charge declines to a point where K can be reversibly or temporarily\n\u201cfixed,\u201d the mineral is no longer considered a true mica, although it has been derived\nfrom mica. These are partially weathered micas that cannot be distinguished from\nprimary micas as previously discussed. Where K-fixing minerals predominate in the\nclay-sized fraction of the soil, K fixation is often related to the clay content of the soil\n(Shaviv et al. 1985). However, K fixation has also been documented in silt-sized and\neven very fine sand-sized vermiculite and hydrobiotite (Harris et al. 1988;\nMurashkina et al. 2007a, b). The effects of soil type and soil horizon on K fixation\noccur primarily because the amounts and types of 2:1 layer silicates vary among soil\ntypes and soil horizons. Particle size distribution and possible artifacts related to\nsample grinding are important for assessing the degree of K fixation because they\naffect the accessibility of interlayer spaces. Smaller particles generally mean easier\naccess to interlayer spaces. In general, however, smaller particles mean more edge\narea per particle and therefore easier access of K to interlayer spaces where it might\nbe fixed.\nThe degree to which 2:1 layer silicates fix K is largely a function of layer charge\nand the distribution of that charge in the octahedral and tetrahedral sheets. Layer\ncharge affects the electrostatic attraction of the layers for K [+] ions (Rich 1968). Other\nfactors being equal, greater layer charge is often correlated with greater potential for\nfixation (Barshad 1954; Bouabid et al. 1991). Murashkina et al. (2007a) speculated\nthat K fixation in some soils dominated by smectite may be due to high-charge\nsmectites that are transitional to vermiculite. Charge location, however, also influences K fixation. Potassium-fixation capacity has been found to be well correlated\nwith isomorphic substitution in tetrahedral sheets, but poorly correlated with isomorphic substitution in octahedral sheets (Bouabid et al. 1991). This is likely\nbecause negative charge originating in the tetrahedral sheet is closer to K [+] ions in\nthe interlayer space (Reid-Soukup and Ulery 2002).\nIn acidic soils, the presence of hydroxy Al interlayers in vermiculite and smectite\nmay affect K fixation (Saha and Inoue 1998). The hydroxy Al interlayers act as\nobstructions between 2:1 layers that restrict the collapse of the interlayer space\naround the K [+] ions. Blockage of the surface results in a decrease in cation exchange\ncapacity and causes K to become more exchangeable and less likely to be fixed. In\naddition, hydroxy interlayers may slow the entry and exit of exchanging cations.\nDue to the impact of layer charge on K fixation, the redox state of structural Fe in\n2:1 layer silicates can also influence K fixation. The chemical reduction of structural\nFe in both smectites and vermiculites has been shown to lead to increases in negative\nlayer charge and K fixation. Furthermore, reduced Fe (i.e., Fe [2+] ) in the tetrahedral\nsheet appears to have a greater impact on K fixation than reduced Fe in the octahedral\nsheet (Chen et al. 1987; Dong et al. 2003; Favre et al. 2006; Florence et al. 2017;\nStucki et al. 1984, 2000). This is likely due to increased coulombic attraction\n\n\n178 M. J.

Conversely, the reduction of structural Fe [3+] in\nexpanded 2:1 layer silicates can lead to interlayer collapse and K fixation (Scott and\nAmonette 1988). Note that the oxidation of structural Fe in micas can either stabilize\nor destabilize interlayer K, depending on both the pH of the environment and on\nwhether oxidation leads to the ejection of the Fe atoms from the octahedral sheet\n(Thompson and Ukrainczyk 2002). When the oxidation of octahedral Fe in biotite,\nfor example, leads to Fe ejection, nearby hydroxyl ions tend to orient toward the\nempty octahedral site, allowing interlayer K ions to nest closer into the ditrigonal\ncavity and subsequently to be held more tenaciously (Barshad and Khishk 1970).\nAlthough redox-driven changes in K fixation and release might explain some\ntemporal fluctuations in soil exchangeable K, more work needs to be done to further\ntest the role of Fe redox processes on K fixation and release.\nRelease of interlayer K is facilitated by the expansion of interlayer spaces when K\nis replaced by cations with larger hydrated radii (e.g., Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] ), as illustrated\nin Fig. 7.2. Adequate soil moisture and low solution K concentrations are prerequisites for the release of interlayer K during the weathering process, with the\nkey role played by solution K concentration, as demonstrated in Fig. 7.8 (Springob\nand Richter 1998; Hinsinger 2002). Key considerations in assessing the potential\ncontribution of released interlayer K for plant uptake are the following: (1) release of\nK potentially bioavailable to plants is limited to the effective diffusion distance\naround roots and root hairs\u2014i.e., the zones of greatest solution K depletion\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 179\n\n\ncorrespond to the rhizosphere, which typically comprises less than about 3% of the\nsoil volume (Hinsinger et al. 2005); and (2) release of K is also favored by a high\nconcentration of H [+] [ions (i.e., low pH). This is explained in greater detail in Chap. 4.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n\n\n7.9 Interpreting \u201cExchangeable Potassium\u201d\n\n\nWhile the strengths and weaknesses of specific soil test procedures are discussed in\n[detail in Chap. 8, the diagnostic tests most commonly associated with the measure-](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nment of surface-adsorbed K is termed \u201cexchangeable K.\u201d Exchangeable K is the K\nextracted from a sample of soil via cation exchange using a solution of a specified\ncomposition under a specific set of conditions. The quantity of exchangeable K\nextracted from a given soil therefore varies according to the extracting solution and\nconditions used. Conditions typically involve displacement of K [+] by NH 4+ ions.\nExchangeable K is generally considered to be bioavailable to plants.\nThe continuum of sorption positions in soil minerals and organic matter is\ntypically distinguished by the affinity for K and the speed of the chemical reactions\nwith simulated soil solutions in soil testing procedures. Accurate quantification of\nthe K in the surface-adsorbed pool can be difficult, especially in soils where there are\nsignificant amounts of weathered mica grains or secondary phyllosilicate minerals.\nIn soils where the charge is predominantly associated with organic matter or\nkaolinite, exchangeable K determinations are a quantification of surface-adsorbed\nK. In such contexts, this measure can be a reliable index of the capacity of the soil to\nsupply bioavailable K to plants over an extended period (Obreza and Rhoads 1988).\n\n+\nA common misconception is that K exchangeable with NH 4 captures only\nsurface-adsorbed K. When soils contain significant amounts of phyllosilicate min\n+\nerals with hydrated interlayers (e.g., smectite or vermiculite), NH 4 will exchange\nnot only with surface-adsorbed K but also with a variable amount of interlayer\nK. The presence of water between individual layers allows cations to diffuse in and\nout of interlayer positions, making cation exchange possible. Ammonium is especially able to replace interlayer K in hydrated layer silicates because its size and\nhydration energy are similar to those of K.\nThe rates of exchange with NH 4+ are variable and difficult to predict, depending\non the minerals involved, the proportions of planar, edge, wedge and interlayer\nadsorption positions, and thus the selectivity of adsorption sites for K (Mengel 1985;\nSparks 1987; Lin 2010; R\u00f6mheld and Kirkby 2010). For example, the rate of K\ndesorption from kaolinite and smectite is usually rapid (Sparks and Jardine 1984),\nwhile from vermiculite and micaceous minerals (i.e., illite) it tends to be much\nslower (Sparks 1987). In these situations, Carey and Metherell (2003), among\nothers, hypothesized that the two-stage extraction of K by tetraphenyl boron could\nbe related to the e-position, including wedge zones (rapid) and i-positions (slow).\nIn most situations, the volume of soil immediately adjacent to roots is small\ncompared to the entire soil volume, so there is unlikely to be a simple, quantitative\nrelationship between K that is exchangeable with ammonium in a soil test procedure\n\n\n180 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nand that acquired by plants during a growing season. However, even in experiments\nin which soil volumes are small and root density is very high, as is typically the case\nin nutrient depletion assays, not all ammonium-exchangeable K is bioavailable to\nplants. Various authors have proposed the concept of a lower accessible limit of the\nexchangeable K pool, below which plants may not be able to extract K (e.g.,\nTabatabai and Hanway 1969; Schneider et al. 2016). Termed the \u201cplant minimal\nexchangeable K\u201d this term could perhaps be more simply described as the \u201cminimal\nplant-accessible K.\u201d The size of this fraction increases with increasing clay and CEC\n(measured at the pH of the soil (Schneider et al. 2016)), suggesting that as clay\ncontent increases the number of K-specific adsorption sites also increases. It may be\nhypothesized that this fraction of the measured exchangeable K could be a useful\npredictor of a \u201cplant minimal solution K concentration\u201d below which plants are\nunable to take up K.\n\n\n7.10 Mineral Transformations\n\n\n7.10.1 Reversible Changes in Interlayer Potassium\n\n\nLong-term K removal in cropping systems can result in accelerated degradation of\nmicas and an increase in secondary phyllosilicate minerals such as vermiculite and\nsmectite (Barr\u00e9 et al. 2008). Conversely, long-term fertilization with K has been\nshown to increase the apparent concentration of mica-like minerals in soils, even\nthough minerals with layer charges high enough to classify as micas were not being\nformed (Scheffer et al. 1960; Ross et al. 1989; Meunier and Velde 2004; Barr\u00e9 et al.\n2008). Ross et al. (1989) reported such observations after only 4 years of high K\nfertilization. Indeed, changes in the proportion of collapsed interlayers in clay\nminerals of rhizosphere soil materials over the course of a single growing season\nhave been reported by Barr\u00e9 et al. (2007b) and by Adamo et al. (2016).\nChanges consistent with these reports have been reported from both cropped and\npasture systems. For example, a 15-year study of alfalfa (Medicago Sativa L.)\ncropping on a loess-derived soil (De-Cheng et al. 2011) showed topsoil exchangeable K decreased due to alfalfa forage uptake and removal, but total K in the topsoil\nincreased, likely due to K uptake and translocation by the alfalfa roots from deep in\nthe soil. A similar phenomenon of enrichment of illite-like clay in temperate region\nsoils has been hypothesized to result from the redistribution of K from deeper soil\nhorizons to the topsoil horizon through root uptake and plant residue deposition\n(Barr\u00e9 et al. 2007a, 2009).\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 181\n\n\n7.10.2 Implications for Building and Depleting Soil Fertility\n\n\nThe fixation and release of K from interlayer positions in phyllosilicate minerals\nrepresent an important buffering system for plant-available reserves of soil K where\nthose minerals occur. Release of K from interlayers can be particularly important\nunder continuous cropping when rates of added K have been inadequate to replace K\nremoved in harvested crop biomass. There is also evidence that fixation of K in these\nminerals stores K when it is added to soils at rates that exceed removal or when it is\n\nredistributed to surface horizons by crop residue deposition, suggesting a degree of\nresilience that can be exploited to manage soil fertility in the longer term.\nThe immediate challenge to the sustainable exploitation of soil K is to develop\nsimple diagnostic indicators of the likely K status of these buffered systems.\nCandidates for this approach would include assays such as those developed by\nCassman et al. (1990) and refined by Murashkina et al. (2007a), in which the extent\nof fixation of added K fertilizer was ascertained. These assays would not only\nprovide information needed to develop an effective K fertilizer application strategy\n[(discussed in Chap. 12), but could also provide an indicator of the extent of K](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_12)\ndepletion of the interlayer buffer system. Such knowledge could allow the K buffer\nsystem to be exploited when K status was moderate or high, but replenished when K\nstatus was low to avoid irreversible degradation of these minerals. Another useful\napproach could be to develop region- or soil-specific predictions of the minimal\nplant-accessible K that are based on an easily determined parameter like clay content\nor CEC.\n\n\n7.11 Short-Term Transformations in the Rhizosphere\n\n\nThe low concentration of K in soil solutions is thought to be an important driver for\nthe release of K through mineral dissolution and interlayer K release. Plant roots play\na key role in depleting soil solution K concentrations in the rhizosphere. Hinsinger\n(1998) reported that solution K concentrations can decrease by 2\u20133 orders of\nmagnitude to as little as 2\u20133 \u03bcM in the vicinity of plant roots, and at these\nconcentrations the release of structural and interlayer K can occur at high rates\n(Springob and Richter 1998, Fig. 7.8). However, it is also clear that this dissolution\nprocess is accentuated by root exudates and other rhizosphere characteristics (e.g.,\nlow pH). For example, plants can release conjugate bases of a variety of organic\nacids and those anions complex Al, contributing to dissolution of aluminosilicate\n[framework minerals like feldspars (Chap. 4). Roots of maize (Zea mays L.) and rape](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n(Brassica napus L.) can release citrate and malate (Hoffland et al. 1989; Pellet et al.\n[1995), while roots of bak choi (Brassica rapa ssp.) (Wang et al. 2000) and radish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_rapa)\n(Raphanus raphanistrum ssp.) (Zhang et al. 1997) have been shown to release\ntartrate. These ions accelerate the dissolution process at mineral surfaces by\ncomplexing and solubilizing Al [3+] from minerals. Z\u00f6rb et al. (2014) suggested that\n\n\n182 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\nthe generation of these exudates is driven by the soil solution K concentration and\ncould be initiated when K concentrations fall to less than 10\u201320 \u03bcM. Plants also\nrelease hydronium ions, which lower the pH in the zone next to the root and\ncontribute to weathering by creating local charge imbalances when they form new\nbonds with oxygen ions at mineral surfaces (Brantley 2003). Much more detailed\n[coverage of these and other rhizosphere transformations is presented in Chap. 4.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_4)\n\n\n7.12 Nonexchangeable Potassium as a Functional Pool\n\n\nNonexchangeable K is soil K that is not measured by soil tests that rely on\nexchange or displacement of K by another cation. The current lack of analytical\ntechniques that can successfully differentiate between K that resides as structural K\nin feldspars; interlayer pools in micas, partially weathered micas and secondary clay\nminerals; or in neoformed K minerals in fertilized soils (pools 9\u201313 in Fig. 7.1)\npresents real problems for predicting the size and behavior of sources of K that are\npotentially bioavailable to plants. Collectively, these pools can make a major\ncontribution to the K uptake by crops. Hinsinger (2006) estimated that this aggregation of K pools could release up to 100 kg K ha [\ufffd][1] year [\ufffd][1], which is a significant\nproportion of plant K demand in many agricultural systems. This is substantiated by\nthe K budgets in the treatments without K fertilization of long-term fertilizer trials in\nEurope (Fig. 7.6). The contributions of interlayer and structural K to crop uptake will\nobviously vary with soil type and mineralogy. For example, Moody and Bell (2006)\ndemonstrated a significant contribution of nonexchangeable K (measured as the\ndifference between exchangeable K and K extracted using sodium tetraphenyl\nborate) to plant uptake in some Vertisols, but effectively no contribution in others.\nSubsequent work indicated that the majority of the nonexchangeable K taken up by\ndifferent plant species in the 15\u201330 soils studied was from dissolution of structural K\nrather than K release from near-edge interlayer positions. The apparent lack of\nsignificant release of K from near-edge interlayer positions in this study may reflect\nthe highly weathered nature of the Australian soils. Nonexchangeable, but nearedge, interlayer K could make a significant contribution to plant uptake from less\nweathered soils in temperate regions where partially weathered micas or vermiculite\nare present (Barr\u00e9 et al., 2007b, 2008).\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the main analytical methods used to\nquantify nonexchangeable K (extraction with boiling HNO 3 or sodium tetraphenyl\n[borate) are discussed in detail in Chap. 8. However, given the inability of current](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nanalytical soil test methods to differentiate between these nonexchangeable K\nsources, that is, structural and near-edge interlayer K, Hinsinger (2006) has\nsuggested they could be referred to collectively as \u201cnonexchangeable K.\u201d This\nterm has merit, as it recognizes the current limitations and uncertainty surrounding\ndiagnostic testing and the variability in interpretation of soil test results across soil\ntypes with differing mineralogy.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 183\n\n\n7.13 Classifying Soils According to Their Potassium\nBehavior\n\n\nSoil Taxonomy, the system of soil classification used in the United States (Soil\nSurvey Staff 2014) groups soils into classes that have similar behavior, use and\nmanagement, and productivity. The lowest level of classification is the family level,\nwhich emphasizes soil properties relevant to the potential use and management of\nthe soil. Differentiating criteria at the family level include particle size classes,\nmineralogy classes, and cation activity classes. In the United States, Soil Taxonomy\nis the basis for soil surveys, which are made by the National Cooperative Soil\nSurvey. These surveys are typically intended for general agriculture and land use\nplanning and are made at scales ranging from 1:12,000 to 1:31,680. Although soil\nsurveys are not intended to be used for making fertilizer recommendations, they\ncould be used to group and identify soils with potential for K fixation or release. This\nwould help researchers identify sites for future K fertility trials or help producers and\nconsultants identify soils that need K fertility recommendations designed to compensate for K fixation or release. Currently, Soil Taxonomy does not include specific\nclassification criteria for recognizing soils with potential for K fixation or release.\nHowever, the system could be modified by extrapolating mineralogical and\nK-fixation data for horizons at well-studied sites to other land areas.\nEffective recognition of K-fixing or K-releasing soils in Soil Taxonomy would\nrequire knowledge of the particle size distribution, mineralogy, and cation exchange\ncapacity of multiple soil horizons, including the surface horizons that are not\ncurrently used in the system\u2019s mineralogy classes at the family level. An assessment\nof the soil\u2019s cation exchange capacity (e.g., before and after heating a K-saturated\nsample of clay fractionated from the soil, as described by Ransom et al. (1988))\ncould be combined with the properties listed above to identify soils with a significant\npotential for buffering plant-available K. Additional work would be required to see if\na similar procedure could be used to recognize soils with a potential for K-fixation\nusing other soil classification systems such as the World Reference Base for Soil\nResources and the Australian Soil Classification System. However, neither soil\nclassification system includes clay mineralogy and cation exchange capacity as\nclassification criteria used to predict soil responses for use and management.\nEven without formal revisions to soil classification systems, informal, local\nmodels to predict the K-supply characteristics and locations of K-fixing or\nK-releasing soils could be useful. For example, O\u2019Green et al. (2008) developed a\nmethod to classify the K-supply characteristics of soils in vineyards of the Lodi\nWinegrape District of California in the United States. Their approach correlated\nreadily available soil survey information about parent material age, mineralogy, and\nweathering intensity with levels of exchangeable K and the K-fixation potential for\nsoils in the region. While their model was specifically designed for this region or for\nwine-grape cropping systems, it is innovative and the concepts could be applied\nelsewhere.\n\n\n184 M. J. Bell et al.\n\n\n7.14 Lessons Learned from Long-Term Experiments\n\n\nExhaustive cropping currently remains the most effective way of quantifying the\nbioavailable fraction of a nonexchangeable K pool, although these results may vary\nconsiderably with crop species (and perhaps even genotypes) and experimental\nconditions. However, long-term experiments offer an opportunity to explore the\nimportance of nonexchangeable soil K reserves, i.e., pools 9\u201312 in Fig. 7.1. An\nexample that quantifies the long-term impact of different K inputs/balances on soil K\ncontent in different K pools at the end of a monitoring period is the study of Blake\net al. (1999), with this extended to cover other long-term experiments in France,\nGermany, and Poland by Hinsinger (2002, 2006, Fig. 7.6). Others have measured the\nchange in soil K stocks in different pools over a defined period between treatment\nsequences or soil sampling events, e.g., Kaminski et al. (2010) and Madaras et al.\n(2014). Still others have reported qualitative changes in secondary phyllosilicate\nminerals in response to either K fertilizer use or unbalanced K removal (Barr\u00e9 et al.\n2007b, 2008). Collectively, such studies have been able to demonstrate the dynamic\nnature of soil K, the importance of mineralogy on K fixation and release (the latter by\neither desorption or dissolution) and the impact of net K balance on the direction of\nK fluxes.\nMany of these studies cannot conclusively identify the pools of soil K that\ncontribute to the overall K balance of the systems investigated. Some are limited\nby their soil sampling strategy, which typically focusses on the cultivated layer\n\n\u2013\n(0 25 cm) or even the upper 10 cm in minimum and zero-tillage systems. The\nsources and sinks of K may well be from deeper soil layers, especially in tropical and\nsubtropical environments where soil temperatures do not limit root exploration and\naccess to subsoil moisture. Nutrient stores in deeper layers are keys to productive\nagricultural systems (Bell et al. 2009), but changes in soil K in these layers are\ntypically not measured (Prasad 2009). Pradier et al. (2017) have measured significant\nchanges of K pools at considerable depth, down to 4 m when sampling the rhizosphere of eucalypt trees in Brazil. They observed an increase of exchangeable K in\nthe rhizosphere, possibly related to weathering of K-bearing minerals, as speculated\nby these authors. Even those that have endeavored to account for changes in the\namount of available K in different profile layers have found it difficult to precisely\nidentify the K pool acting as the predominant source or sink for K. This relates to the\n[limitations of existing soil test methods, discussed in Chap. 8, which are effectively](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_8)\nlimited to identifying changes in exchangeable and nonexchangeable K. Both measures will access different K pools in soils with different mineralogy, making\nextrapolation to other soil types and cropping systems challenging.\n\n\n7 Considering Soil Potassium Pools with Dissimilar Plant Availability 185\n\n\n7.15 Prognosis\n\n\nA better understanding of the allocation of K bioavailability to plants among\ndifferent functional pools in agricultural soils will allow the development of more\ndefensible and economically justifiable fertilizer recommendations. This will particularly apply to soils where there are significant amounts of nonexchangeable K in\neither (or both of) three-dimensional framework or layer silicate minerals. The\ndevelopment of such an understanding will require the use of a combination of\ndiagnostic soil K tests, including those that will provide an assessment of the likely\navailability of applied K fertilizer. While this will increase the costs of soil testing,\nthe greater certainty provided around understanding the K status of the particular\nfield under management will add considerable confidence to fertilizer decisions.\nFurther research is clearly required on this topic, as is research on soil sampling\nprotocols that allow quantification of K status in the soil layers from which the crop\nacquires significant quantities of K.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAdamo P, Barr\u00e9 P, Cozzolino V, Di Meo V, Velde B (2016) Short term clay mineral release and\n[re-capture of potassium in a Zea mays field experiment.

All the forms of K were\ncorrelated with each other revealing the existence of\ndynamic equilibrium among them.\n\n\n**Keywords** Forms of potassium, K dynamics, Cropping systems.\n\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\n\nSoil fertility is declining mostly as a result of excessive nutrient loss and insufficient nutrient addition via\nfertilizers and manures. This circumstance puts Indian\nagriculture under pressure to produce more food on\ndwindling arable land. Thus, intensive cropping is\nnecessary and future food production will grow increasingly reliant on mineral fertilizers, which have\nbecome indispensable for assuring adequate food\nproduction and reversing soil productivity reduction\ndue to nutrient depletion.\n\n\nPotassium is third most important plant nutrient\nwhich is absorbed by plant is in larger amount than\n\n\n426\n\n\nany other mineral element except nitrogen and it is\none of the three main pillars of balanced fertilizer use,\nalong with nitrogen and phosphorus. The potassium is\nmobile in plant, unlike other major nutrients, it\u2019s not\nthe integral part of the plant component but, it plays\na vital role in enzyme activity, acts as a catalyst for\ncarbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, translocation of assimilates, synthesis of proteins, as well as\nformation, break down and translocation of starch,\nmaintains water balance, agronomic productivity and\nsustainability (Mangel 1985).\n\n\nThe results of long term fertilizer experiments in\nIndia revealed that by growing crops without K for\nlonger periods lead the mining of soil native K and\nthere by declining available K. The availability of\nK in soil is governed by both organic and inorganic\nforms and prevailing soil chemical environment.\nAvailability of native K to plants is largely regulated\nby the dynamic equilibrium existing between different\nforms of K viz., water soluble-K, which is taken up\nby the plants and microbes directly (Sparks 2000);\nexchangeable-K, held by negative charges on clay\nparticles, humic substances and it is exchangeable\nwith cations and readily available to plants, non-exchangeable or fixed-K, which is trapped between\nthe layers of dioctahedral and trioctahedral micas,\nvermiculites and it is sparingly available to plants\n(Sparks and Huang 1985) and while lattice \u2013K or\nmineral or structural K, an integral part of primary\nK bearing minerals which compraises 98% of total\nK. Knowledge on these different potassium fractions\nin soils is essential for potassium management to\ndetermine long term sustainability of cropping systems. To formulate sound fertilizer recommendation,\npotassium supplying capacity of soil is essential.\nThis will depend not only on the available K content\nof soil, but also knowledge on different forms of K\nand their relationship among themselves is required.\nKeeping this in view, the present study was under\ntaken to assess dynamics of soil potassium under\ndifferent cropping systems in Y.S.R Kadapa district\nof Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\n\n\nThe present study was carried out in Y.S.R Kadapa\n\n\n\ndistrict of Andhra Pradesh. The district is situated at\n\nGeographical Co-ordination of 13\u00b0 43\u2019 to 15\u00b0 14\u2019 of\nNorthern latitude and 77\u00b0 55\u2019 to 79\u00b0 29\u2019 of the Eastern\n\nlongitude. This district lies in river basin of Pennar.\nThe district is classified as drought Prone area due to\nscanty and uneven distribution of rain fall. The annual\nrainfall of the district is 700 mm. Five soil samples\nfrom each cropping system at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm\ndepths were collected from the Y.S.R. district viz.,\nfallow \u2013 bengalgram, sunflower \u2013 sesame, paddy\n\u2013 paddy, groundnut mono cropping and groundnut \u2013\ngroundnut cropping sequences during 2018-19. Soil\nsample were air-dried, ground in a wooden pestle with\nmortar and passed through a 2mm stainless steel sieve\nand used for determining various soil properties by\nfollowing standard procedures.\n\n\nWater soluble K was extracted by shaking the\nsoil water suspension in the ratio of 1:5 for 5 min\nthen filtered and K was determined (Jackson 1973)\nand available K was extracted with neutral normal\n\nammonium acetate with 1:5 soil solution ratio and\nshaking for five minutes (Hanway and Heidel 1952).\nThe exchangeable K was obtained by subtracting\nwater-soluble K from available K. The non-exchangeable K was estimated by following the method as\ndescribed by Wood and De Turk (1941). Lattice-K\nwas calculated from the difference between total K\nand the sum of NH 4 OAc-K and nonexchangeable K\n(Wiklander 1954). Total K in soil was estimated by\nHF-HClO 4 digestion method using platinum crucibles as outlined by Pratt (1965). Potassium in all the\nextracts was estimated flame photometrically. The\nstatistical analysis was done to understand correlation\namong different forms of potassium and with soil\nproperties\n\n\n**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**\n\n\nDistribution of different forms of potassium under\ndifferent cropping systems tabulated in Table 1.\n\n\n**Available K**\n\n\nThe available K content of surface soils varied from\n73.65 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nto 282.80 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence\nwith mean values of 84.55 and 262.80 mg kg- [1] and\n\n\n427\n\n\n**Table 1.** Distribution of different forms of potassium under different cropping systems.\n\n\nCropping systems                        Available K                Water soluble K              Exchangeable K\n(mg kg [-1] )                    (mg kg [-1] )                   (mg kg [-1] )\n0-15 cm      15-30 cm      0-15 cm      15-30 cm      0-15 cm      15-30 cm\n\n\nMin 146.75 113.80 12.65 5.95 134.10 107.85\n\n1.

In sub-surface soils available K content\nvaried from 51.30 mg kg- [1] in groundnut monocropping system to 160.90 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence with mean values of 55.08 and 151.73\nmg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K 0.17\nand 1.58, respectively.\n\n\nThe highest available potassium was observed in\nsoils of paddy-paddy cropping system in both surface\nand sub-surface soils, which might be due to contin\n\n\nuous application of potassic fertilizers to both the\ncrops and lowest available potassium was recorded\nin sunflower-sesame cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system in surface and sub-surface\nsoils, respectively which might be due to continuous\nless application of potassic fertilizers application\nthan crop needed or imbalanced fertilization in crop\nnutrition caused mining of its native pools. Similar\nresults reported by Katkar _et al_ . (2011). The data\nfurther revealed that highest available potassium was\nobserved in surface soils than in sub-surface soils in\n\n\n428\n\n\nall cropping systems, which might be attributed to\npresence of vegetation or upward translocation of K\nfrom lower layers through capillary rise or ground\nwater as reported by Lungmuana _et al_ . (2014).\n\n\n**Water soluble K**\n\n\nThe water soluble K content of surface soils varied\nfrom 5.5 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping\nsystem to 43.30 mg kg- [1] in groundnut -groundnut\ncropping sequence with mean values of 9.52 and\n37.24 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K\n0.07 and 0.18, respectively. In sub-surface soils water\nsoluble K content varied from 5.05 mg kg- [1] in sunin\nflower-sesame cropping system to 17.25 mg kg- [1]\ngroundnut -groundnut cropping sequence with mean\nvalues of 6.63 and 14.35 mg kg- [1] and their per cent\ncontribution to total K 0.03 and 0.18, respectively.\n\n\nThe highest water soluble K was observed in\nsoils of groundnut-groundnut cropping system in\nsurface and sub-surface soils, which might be due to\naddition of fertilizers, presence of potassium bearing\nminerals while lowest water soluble K was observed\nin sunflower-sesame cropping system at both depths,\nwhich might be due to exhaustive nature of crops.\nThe data further revealed that highest water soluble\nK was observed in surface soils than in sub-surface\n\nsoils in all cropping systems, which might be due to\ncapillary movement of potassium from lower depth\nto upper portion reported by Hebsur and Gali (2011).\n\n\n**Exchangeable K**\n\n\nThe exchangeable K content of surface soils varied\nfrom 68.10 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping\nsystem to 254.10 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping\nsequence with mean values of 75.03 and 236.77\nmg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to total K\n0.52 and 1.20, respectively. In sub-surface soils\nexchangeable K content varied from 43.70 mg kg- [1]\nin groundnut monocropping system to 144.05 mg\nkg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence with mean\nvalues of 46.07 and 138.84 mg kg- [1] and their per cent\ncontribution to total K 0.14 and 1.44, respectively.\n\n\nThe highest exchangeable K was observed in\nsoils of paddy-paddy cropping system in both surface\n\n\n\nand sub-surface soils, which might be due to high\ndose of K fertilizers were applied to paddy in both\nseasons or due to the fact that soils contain relatively\nhigher clay per cent which offered more exchangeable sites for K. these results were in agreement with\n(Hebsur and Gali 2011) and lowest exchangeable K\nwas observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nand groundnut monocropping system in surface and\nsub-surface soils respectively might be due to exhaustive nature of sunflower and sesame crops and low\nutilization under groundnut monocropping system or\ndue to non replenishment of K from the other (Rao\n_et al_ . 2013). The results further revealed that highest\nexchangeable K was observed in surface soils than in\nsub-surface soils in all cropping systems.\n\n\n**Non-exchangeable K**\n\n\nThe non-exchangeable K content of surface soils\nvaried from 309.95 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame\ncropping system to 970.35 mg kg- [1] in fallow-bengalgram cropping sequence with mean values of 337.35\nand 896.49 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution\nto total K 2.33 and 5.08, respectively. In sub-surface\nsoils non-exchangeable K content varied from 238.80\nmg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system to\n623.00 mg kg- [1] in paddy-paddy cropping sequence\nwith mean values of 275.13 and 602.53 mg kg- [1] and\ntheir per cent contribution to total K 1.15 and 6.26,\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe highest non-exchangeable K was observed\nin soils of fallow-bengalgram cropping system and\npaddy-paddy in surface and sub-surface soils, respectively which might be due to higher percentage\nof clay in these soils and lowest non-exchangeable K\nwas observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nat both depths, which might be due to continuous\ncropping with less application of K fertilizers may\ndecreased K content in these cropping systems. The\ndata further revealed that highest non-exchangeable\nK was observed in surface soils than in sub-surface\nsoils in all cropping systems. These findings were in\nagreement with Mazumdar _et al._ 2014.\n\n\n**Lattice K**\n\n\nThe lattice K content of surface soils varied from\n\n\n11498.10 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping\nsystem to 23326.60 mg kg- [1] in groundnut-groundnut\ncropping sequence with mean values of 14038.10 and\n20116.32 mg kg- [1] and their per cent contribution to\ntotal K 94.00 and 97.08, respectively. In sub-surface\nsoils lattice K content varied from 6460.20 mg kg- [1]\nin groundnut-groundnut cropping system to 35828.20\nmg kg- [1] in groundnut monocropping sequence with\nmean values of 7219.58 and 31708.88 mg kg- [1] and\ntheir per cent contribution to total K 92.18 and 98.68,\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe highest lattice K was observed in soils of\ngroundnut-groundnut cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system in surface and sub-surface\nsoils, respectively. These findings were in accordance\nwith Sawarkar _et al_ . 2013 which might be due to these\nsoils were derived from potassic bearing minerals\nhowever, lowest lattice K was observed in sunflower-sesame cropping system and groundnut-groundnut\ncropping system in surface and sub-surface soils,\nrespectively. The data further revealed that highest lattice K was observed in surface soils than in\n\nsub-surface soils in all cropping systems, except in\nfallow-bengalgram cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system which might be attributed to\nincrease in finer fractions of soil particles at lower\ndepth.\n\n\n**Total K**\n\n\nThe total K content of surface soils varied from\n11920 mg kg- [1] in sunflower-sesame cropping system\nto 24190 mg kg- [1] in groundnut-groundnut cropping\nsequence with mean values of 14460 and 20952 mg\nkg- [1], respectively. In sub-surface soils total K content\nvaried from 6990 mg kg- [1 ] in groundnut-groundnut\n\n\n\n429\n\n\ncropping system to 33330 mg kg- [1] in groundnut\nmonocropping sequence with mean values of 7834\nand 32134 mg kg- [1], respectively.\n\n\nThe highest total K was observed in soils of\ngroundnut-groundnut cropping system and groundnut\nmonocropping system in surface and sub-surface\nsoils, respectively which might be due to predominance of potassium bearing primary minerals and\nlowest total K was observed in sunflower-sesame\ncropping system and groundnut-groundnut cropping\nsystem in surface and sub-surface soils, respectively.\nThe data further revealed that highest total K was\nobserved in surface soils than in sub-surface soils in\n\nall cropping systems, except in fallow-bengalgram\ncropping system and groundnut monocropping system. Similar results were reported by Mazumdar _et_\n_al._ (2014).\n\n\n**Correlation among forms of potassium**\n\n\nCorrelation between forms of potassium with soil\nproperties in surface and sub-surface soils, tabulated\nin Tables 2-3, respectively.\n\n\nIn surface soils available K was positively\nand significantly correlated with water soluble K\n(r = 0.416*), exchangeable K (r = 0.987**) and\nnon-exchangeable K (r = 0.791**). Similar results\nwere obtained by Swamanna _et al._ (2015) under rice\ngrowing soils of Kurnool district of A.P. Available\nK also showed positive and significant correlation\nwith total K (r = 0.421*). Water soluble K was\nhighly and significantly correlated with available K\n(r = 0.416*) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.744**).\nSimilar results were reported by Kundu _et al_ .

These observations were in accordance\nto the results reported by Dhakad _et al_ . (2017), Saini\nand Grewal (2014). Exchangeable K was highly and\nsignificantly correlated with available K (r = 0.987**)\nand non-exchangeable K (r = 0.708**) indicating that\ndecline in the level of exchangeable K is replenished\nby the release of non-exchangeable K. Similar results\nreported by Elbaalawy _et al._ (2016). Swamanna _et_\n_al. (_ 2015). Non-exchangeable K was highly and significantly correlated with available K (r = 0.791**),\nwater soluble K (r = 744**) and exchangeable K (r =\n0.708**). Similar observations were made by Dhakad\n_et al_ . (2017), Lakaria _et al_ . (2012), Prasad _et al._\n_(_ 2010), Swamanna _et al._ (2015). Non-exchangeable\nK positively and significantly correlated with lattice K\n(r = 705**) and total K (r = 0.741**). Lattice K was\nhighly and significantly correlated with water soluble\nK (r = 0.665**) non-exchangeable K (r = 0.705**)\nand total K (r = 0.999**). Total K was highly and\nsignificantly correlated with available K (r = 0.421*),\nwater soluble K (r = 0.682**), non-exchangeable K (r\n= 0.741**) and lattice K (r = 0.999**). Similar results\nwere obtained by Dhakad _et al_ . (2017) indicating\nthat these relationships confirmed that availability of\nexchangeable, nonexchangeable and total potassium\ncould significantly determine potentially available\npotassium in these soils.\n\n\nAll the forms of K showed a positive trend of\ncorrelation among themselves largely corroborating\nthe well-known concept of existence of a dynamic\nequilibrium among different forms of K present in\nsoil through which K supply to the roots of crop\nplants are directly or indirectly ensured as reported\n\n\n\nLungmuana _et al._ 2014.\n\n\nIn sub-surface soils available K was highly and\nsignificantly correlated with exchangeable K (r =\n0.766**) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.943**).\nSimilar observations were made by Jatav and Dewangan (2012). Whereas available K also showed\nnegative and significant correlation with lattice K (r\n= -0.482*) and total K (r = -0.472*). Water soluble\nK was positively and significantly correlated with\nnon-exchangeable K (r = 0.486*). Exchangeable K\nwas highly and significantly correlated with available\nK (r = 0.766**) and non-exchangeable K (r = 0.701*).\nSimilar results reported by Jatav and Dewangan\n(2012) Rajeevana and Kavitha (2017). Non-exchangeable K was highly and significantly correlated\nwith available K (r = 0.943**), water soluble K (r =\n0.486*) and exchangeable K (r = 0.701**). Similar\nobservations were made by Rajeevana and Dewangan\n(2017). Non-exchangeable K was negatively and\nsignificantly correlated with lattice K (r = -0.472*)\nand total K (r = -0.462*). Lattice K was highly and\nsignificantly correlated with total K (r = 0.999**)\nwhile it was negatively and significantly correlated\nwith available K  (r = -0.482*) and non-exchangeable\nK (r = -0.472*). Total K was highly and significantly\ncorrelated with lattice K (r = 0.999**) but it was negatively and significantly correlated with available K\n(r = -0.472*) and non-exchangeable K (r = -0.462*).\n\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n\nBased on these results, it is therefore suggested that\nK removal by the crop must be supplemented to\nsustain the soil fertility either by K application or by\n\n\ncrop straw incorporation to the soil. Soil K fractions\nvaried with depth and cropping sequences. Soil K\nfractions were found in the order lattice K > non-ex\nchangeable K > available K > exchangeable K > water\nsoluble K. Under irrigated conditions all the forms\nof potassium were highest in paddy-paddy cropping\nsystem followed by groundnut-groundnut cropping\nsystem and sunflower-sesame cropping system while\nunder rainfed conditions all the forms of potassium\nwere highest in fallow-bengalgram cropping system\nfollowed by groundnut monocropping system. The\nresults and the methodology adopted in the present\nstudy will be useful in assessing forms of K under\ndifferent cropping systems. These results would not\nonly useful for the study area, but also in other cropping systems across the globe.\n\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n\nDhakad H, Yadav SS, Jamra S, Arya V, Sharma K, Gaur D (2017)\nStatus and distribution of different forms of potassium in soils\nof Gwalior district (MP) _Int J Che Stu_ 5: 161-164.\nElbaalawy AM, Benbi DK, Benipal DS (2016) Potassium forms in\nrelation to clay mineralogy other soil properties in different\nagro-ecological sub-regions of Northern India. _Agric Res J_\n53: 200-206.\n\nHanway JJ, Heidel H (1952) Soil analysis methods, as used in Iowa\nState. _College Soil Testing Laboratory, Iowa, Agriculture_\n57: 1-31.\n\nHebsur NS, Gali SK ( 2011) Potassium dynamics in soils under\ndifferent cropping systems of Karnataka.

Therefore,\n\n\nsustainability requires improvements in the soil efficiency management. This study evaluated\n\n\nthe influence of soil management and crop succession or rotation combinations with cotton\n\n\non K dynamics and exchangeable reserves in the soil profile, and the partial balance of K after\n\n\nnine years of cultivation in a clayey Oxisol in the Cerrado. The soil was sampled in layers up\n\n\nto 100 cm depth in four cotton production systems treatments: 1) conventional soil tillage\n\n\n(CST) with cotton monoculture; 2) CST with annual cotton-soybean-cotton succession; 3) CST\n\n\nwith cotton/soybean/maize rotation; and 4) no-tillage system (NTS) with cotton/soybean/\n\n\nmaize rotation and _Urochloa ruziziensis_ (ruzigrass) as a cover crop in the off-season after grain\n\n\ncrops. The experiment was conducted using a randomized block design with four replications.\n\n\nCST with cotton monoculture favored the leaching of K surplus from fertilization. Crop rotation\n\n\nincluding ruzigrass in the NTS allowed better control of K dynamics, ensuring its circulation in\n\n\nthe soil-plant compartments and reducing leaching. The increased organic matter (OM) in this\n\n\nsystem enlarges the storage capacity of K in the topsoil. The adoption of no-tillage crop systems\n\n\nintegrating ruzigrass is viable to improve the efficiency of K fertilizers in cotton cultivation in\n\n\nhighly weathered tropical soils.\n\n\n**Keywords** : _Urochloa ruziziensis_, no-tillage, long-term experiment, potassium fertilization,\n\n\ntropical savanna\n\n\n**\u200b**\n\n\n\nBrazil is one of the world\u2019s major cotton producers with\na cultivated area of 1.66 million ha in the 2019-2020 **\u200b**\n\nseason and 98 % of the production from the Cerrado\nbiome (CONAB, 2020), a Brazilian tropical savanna\nthat encompasses around 205 million ha. Oxisols (Soil\nSurvey Staff, 2014), predominant soil group in the\nCerrado, have good drainage, but are naturally acidic,\npresenting high Al saturation and poor natural fertility\nwith low OM content and CEC. The use of liming\nand fertilizer amendments in the last decades led\n\nsoils to become one of the most relevant agricultural\nenvironments for food production worldwide (Lopes\nand Guilherme, 2016).\nTo achieve high yield and fiber quality, cotton\ncropping in Cerrado uses large amounts of fertilizers,\nwhich increase the production cost. Cotton demands\nhigh amounts of K, since it is vital for fiber formation\nand quality (Yang et al., 2016). The production of 1 ton\nof seed cotton requires an extraction equivalent to 58\nkg ha [\u20131] of K 2 O from the soil, but only 30 % of that is\nexported by the harvested cottonseeds and fibers (Borin\net al., 2019).\nIn tropical soils, K supply to plants occurs\nmainly by the exchangeable form, but also by the\nnon-exchangeable form and K is also released by crop\nresidues (Rosolem et al., 2019). Depending on fertilizer\n\n\n\nmanagement, crop combination, and soil characteristics,\nK surplus from fertilization remain more susceptible to\nrunoff or leaching losses. Since these soils have a limited\n\n**\u200b** K adsorption capacity, no-tillage system (NTS) and the\n\ninsertion of forage grasses into crop rotation can be a\nstrategy to conserve soil K fertility, because Poaceae\nplants are very efficient in cycling K (Garcia et al., 2008;\nResende et al., 2019; Rosolem et al., 2019).\nConsumption of K fertilizers in Brazil reached\n6.77 million tons of K 2 O in 2018, while worldwide use\ncorresponded to 38.85 million tons of K 2 O (FAO, 2020).\nNational mineral reserves are limited and currently\nabout 95 % of the K fertilizer is imported (Boldrin et\nal., 2019), which justifies efforts in developing technical\napproaches to increase the K use efficiency in the\nBrazilian agriculture.\nThis study evaluated the influence of soil\nmanagement and crop combinations with cotton on\nK dynamics, exchangeable reserves in the soil and\npartial balance after nine years in a clayey Oxisol in the\nBrazilian Cerrado.\n\n\n**Materials and Methods**\n\n\n**Study site**\n\n\nA long-term experiment under rainfed conditions was\nconducted between Aug 2005 and Oct 2014 in the\n\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Sci.

The soil\nis classified as clayey dystrophic Red Latosol (Santos et\nal., 2013), Typic Haplorthox (Oxisol) (Soil Survey Staff,\n2014). The climate is Aw, according to the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger\nclimate classification system (Alvares et al., 2013), with\nan average rainfall of 1,800 mm, concentrated from Oct\nto Mar.\n\nIn the three years prior to the experiment, the area\nwas cultivated with cotton, and before that, soybean\nmonoculture, with the soil prepared annually by plowing\nand harrowing. In Aug 2005, the soil was sampled at\n0-20 cm depth and underwent the chemical and particle\nsize analyses (Table 1). In early Sept 2005, the entire\nexperimental area received 2,200 kg ha [\u20131] of calcitic\nlimestone with 90 % calcium carbonate equivalent and\nwas subsoiled at 35 cm depth, subsequently plowed and\nharrowed.\n\n\n**Experimental design and treatments**\n\n\nThe experiment was conducted for nine years and\nconsisted of four production systems involving cotton\ncultivation: 1) conventional soil tillage (CST) with\ncotton monoculture CSTCM; 2) CST with annual cottonsoybean-cotton succession (CSTCSC); 3) CST with cotton/\nsoybean/maize rotation (CSTCSM); and 4) cotton under\na no-tillage system - NTS [soybean (spring-summer)\n+ _Urochloa ruziziensis_ (ruzigrass) (autumn-winter)/\nmaize intercropped with ruzigrass (spring-summer)/\ncotton (spring-summer-autumn)]. CST treatments were\nfallow in autumn-winter (Table 2). The experiment was\nconducted using a randomized block design with four\n\n\n\nreplications. The experimental plot for each cropping\nsystem covered an area of 576 m [2] (14.4 \u00d7 40 m). Native\nvegetation (native Cerrado) without management\ninterventions in a site adjacent to the experiment was\nused as a reference for exchangeable K and OM content\nin the soil profile.\n\n\n**Tillage systems, crop management, and harvest**\n\n\nTreatments with CST were prepared annually between\nlate Sept and early Oct, after the beginning of the rainy\nseason. The preparation consisted of a disc harrowing\nto turn the soil over up to 20 cm deep, followed by a\nleveling disc harrowing. Another leveling disc harrowing\noperation was performed two days before soybean,\nmaize, or cotton sowing.\nIn Aug 2009, 2,000 kg ha [\u20141] of dolomitic limestone\nwith 85 % calcium carbonate equivalent was applied.\nIn Oct 2009, before sowing the crops, 1,000 kg ha [\u20131] of\nphosphogypsum (PG) was added. In CST treatments,\nthese additives were incorporated up to 20 cm with\nplowing and harrowing and were broadcasted on the\nsoil surface without incorporation in the NTS treatment.\nDuring the nine years of the experiment, soybean\nwas sown in the spring, in the second half of Oct,\nafter the beginning of the rainy season. Soybean row\nspacing was 45 cm. Maize was sown between late\nOct and early Nov also at 45-cm row spacing. Cotton\nwas sown from late Nov to mid-Dec, with 80 cm row\nspacing. Plant populations per ha ranged from 350,000\nto 400,000, 55,000 to 65,000, and 80,000 to 100,000, for\nsoybean, maize, and cotton, respectively, depending on\nthe cultivar used each year.

All soybean\nfertilization was applied in the sowing furrow. Maize\nand cotton received all phosphate fertilizer and\napproximately 20 % of N and 50 % of K 2 O in the sowing\nfurrow. The remaining N and K 2 O amounts were divided\ninto two topdressing applications. The total amounts\nof fertilizers, in kg ha [\u20131] of N, P 2 O 5, and K 2 O, were 999,\n1,134, and 1,170 in CSTCM treatment; 579, 846 and 834\nin CSTCSC and 642, 897 and 939 in CSTCSM and NTS.\nIn the NTS treatment, after soybean harvest,\nruzigrass was mechanically sown using 6 kg ha [\u20131] of\nseeds with 100 % culture value. This operation occurred\ntwo days after desiccation of volunteer soybean plants\nand weeds in the plots using the paraquat herbicide\n(400 g ha [\u20131] of active ingredient). Maize in the NTS was\nintercropped with ruzigrass using 7 kg ha [\u20131] of seeds\nwith 85 % culture value mixed with the starter fertilizer\n\ndistributed in the sowing furrows. Ruzigrass remained in\nthe plots as a cover plant throughout the off-season after\nsoybean or maize and was desiccated with glyphosate\n(1,400 g ha [\u20131 ] of active ingredient) 30 days before sowing\nthe next maize or cotton crop.\nCotton, maize, and soybean crops were manually\nharvested in each experimental plot, at three random\npoints, each including four rows 5-m long. Yield was\nobtained by adding the data collected at the three points\nand the results were converted into kg ha [\u20131 ] and grain\nmoisture corrected to 13 %.\n\nThe accumulated export of K in each production\nsystem was determined by multiplying crop yields by\nthe mean removal rates, equivalent to 17, 20, and 3.7\nkg of K 2 O per ton of seed cotton, soybean, and maize\ngrains, respectively (Borin et al., 2019; Duarte et al.,\n2019; Embrapa, 2013). From exported quantities, partial\nbalances of K (Resende et al., 2019) were estimated, as\nwell as the exported/applied ratios of the K fertilizer\nused in the period.\n\n\n**Soil sampling and analysis**\n\n\nIn Oct 2014, soil samples were collected from the\nexperimental plots and in the native Cerrado of an\nadjacent area, at the 0-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-60, and 61100 cm layers of the profile, to analyze the exchangeable\nK and soil organic matter (SOM) contents. At each depth,\n10 soil samples were collected and homogenized to form\na composite sample for the laboratory analysis. The\nexchangeable K was extracted with Mehlich-1 solution\nand quantified in a flame photometer, while SOM was\ndetermined by the Walkley-Black method (Teixeira et\nal., 2017).\n\n\n**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**\n\n\n\n**Statistical analysis**\n\n\nThe data at each sampling layer were submitted to the\nanalysis of variance using SISVAR software (Statistical\nAnalysis System, version 5.6) with means compared by\nthe Tukey test. A _p_ \u2264 0.05 was used to indicate statistical\nsignificance.\n\n\n**Results and Discussion**\n\n\n**Exchangeable potassium and organic matter**\n**contents in the soil**\n\n\nAlthough the exchangeable K contents were not\nstatistically compared between the sampling depths,\nthe highest absolute values were detected in the upper\nlayers of the soil profile, mainly at 0-5 cm, decreasing\nprogressively with depth, irrespective of the treatment\n(Figure 1). Ferreira et al. (2009) also observed this\ntendency in a Rhodic Hapludox (Oxisol). The authors\nstated that reducing K levels in the profile are associated\nwith a gradual lowering in organic carbon (OC) contents\nand soil organic matter (SOM) to retain cations in deeper\nlayers.\nThe SOM levels determined in the samples up\nto 100 cm in the profile (Figure 2) follow the same\ntendency as exchangeable K (Figure 1), indicating a\nstrong relationship between these two variables. This\nbehavior is expected for highly weathered soils, with\nlow-activity clays, like the studied Oxisol, in which SOM\naccounts for most CEC (Lopes and Guilherme, 2016)\nand, therefore, for the retention of K in the soil profile.\nThe highest K content (1.18 cmol c dm [\u20133] ) in NTS\nwas found in the 0-5 cm layer (Figure 1) and was 79 %\nhigher than the mean value of the three CST treatments,\nconsistent with the higher SOM content in this layer\nfor NTS (Figure 2). Considering that the SOM and CEC\nare positively correlated in the Cerrado Oxisols (Lopes\nand Guilherme, 2016; Ramos et al., 2018), it seems\nthat the increased CEC enhances the K retention and\n\naccumulation. The absence of soil tillage for nine years,\nstraw production and abundant root development of _U._\n_ruziziensis_ (ruzigrass) used as a cover plant (Sanches et\nal., 2020), along with cotton, maize, and soybean crop\nresidues in the NTS treatment, certainly had a positive\ninfluence on SOM accumulation and, consequently,\non K levels in the 0-5 cm layer. The average annual of\nstraw available in NTS for soybean sowing was 3,945\nkg ha [\u20131], from cotton crop residues; for corn sowing,\n9,137 kg ha [\u20131] of the ruzigrass straw; and for cotton\nsowing, 11,388 kg ha [\u20131] of the maize crop residues and\nruzigrass straw.\nThe production system and history of K\nfertilization influenced the K dynamics in soil profile.\nIn the upmost surface layer, the exchangeable K content\nwas 66 % higher in NTS compared to CSTCM. However,\nin the deeper sampling layer, the situation was reversed\nwith CSTCM presenting more than twice the K content\n\n\n**3**\n\n\n**Ferreira et al.** **Potassium reserve in Oxisol**\n\n\n**Figure 1** \u2013 Exchangeable K content in clayey Oxisol up to 100 cm depth after nine harvests in different cotton production systems.

The comparison between the CSTCSM and\nNTS treatments, which received the same commercial\ncrops and fertilizer amounts, shows that in the latter,\nthe K content in the 0-5, 6-10, and 11-20 cm layers,\nwas 93 %, 115 %, and 117 % higher, respectively. At\ndepths 21-30, 31-60, and 61-100, the K levels were\nstatistically similar between the CSTCSC, CSTCSM, and\nNTS treatments. These results reflect the role of SOM\n\nin increasing the net negative charge of the soil that can\nretain more cations in the top layers of the NTS (Ramos\net al., 2018), as well as the active recovery of K by the\nruzigrass root system from the deep layers to topsoil\n(Tanaka et al., 2019).\nThe weighted average of the sample layers up to\n20 cm shows that the exchangeable K corresponded to\n0.53 cmol c dm [\u20133] in the NTS, equivalent to 829 kg ha [\u20131]\nof potassium chloride fertilizer (KCl), and to 0.26 cmol c\ndm [\u20133] in CSTCSM (407 kg ha [\u20131] of KCl). The conservationist\nmanagement system with crop rotation under no-tillage\nand the inclusion of ruzigrass as a cover plant in the\noff-season retained more than twice the K available for\n\n\n**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**\n\n\n\nabsorption in the soil layer with greater root activity of\nthe commercial crops, equivalent to about 422 kg ha [\u20131]\nof additional KCl. This contrasting dynamics reinforces\nthe importance of the no-till farming to prevent nutrient\nlosses to runoff (Almeida et al., 2021), besides the strong\ninfluence of covering the soil by living plants as much\nas possible throughout the year to keep K recycling and\nits accessibility to plants in the crop system (Resende et\nal., 2019). The joint effect of no-till and ruzigrass activity\ncomposes an effective way to improve the use efficiency\nof K fertilizer in tropical soils.\nAlthough not statistically compared, the reference\nsoil from the native Cerrado area that had never been\n\nfertilized presented exchangeable K levels similar to\nthose found in some production systems with annual\ncrops at different depths (Figure 1). This shows that\nthe clayey soil with a relatively high SOM content\nin that area (Figure 2) has a natural K reserve that is\npossibly kept due to the action of native vegetation roots\ndistributed at great depths, promoting efficient recycling\nover time.\n\n\n**4**\n\n\n**Ferreira et al.** **Potassium reserve in Oxisol**\n\n\n**Figure 2** \u2013 Organic matter content in clayey Oxisol up to 100 cm depth after nine harvests in different cotton production systems.

Native\nCerrado as reference of the natural condition.\n\n\n\n**Partial potassium balance and exchangeable**\n**potassium pool in the soil profile**\n\n\nThe highest exchangeable K levels in the deeper sampling\nlayer were observed in the CSTCM treatment (Figure 1).\nThis treatment received the greatest cumulative dose of\nthe nutrient over the nine years of the experiment (Figure\n3A), which, associated with recurrent monocrop, plowing\nand harrowing, must have led to K mobilization to the\ndeeper layers of the soil profile. Below 60 cm, the volume\nand specific surface area of cotton roots are much smaller\n(Carmi et al., 1993), restricting their capacity to absorb\nnutrients. This low absorption possibly increases K loss\nfrom the system due to leaching out of the root exploration\n\nzone.\nThe equivalent amounts of K 2 O stored up to 100\ncm deep were estimated for the treatments, assuming\na soil bulk density equal to 1.0 kg dm [\u20133] over the entire\nsampling profile. The native Cerrado soil condition had\n\u00b1 591 kg ha [\u20131] of K 2 O equivalent in exchangeable form,\nwhich reflects a stabilized state mainly because of\nbiological recycling. Therefore, the anthropic use of soils\nwith cultivation for many years before the experiment\n\n\n**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**\n\n\n\nmust have changed this equilibrium. Nevertheless, the\npool of exchangeable K that built up after nine years of\nfertilization in different production systems (Figure 3A)\nindicates that the cultivated Oxisol can retain, at least\ntemporarily, a higher amount of K in the profile than the\nexisting amount in the original environment.\nSoil acidity control practices, such as liming and PG\namending, may promote an increase in CEC in soils with\npredominance of variable charges, as observed by Fageria\net al. (2014), enhancing the potential for K retention\nby negative colloidal charges. However, the effects of\ndifferent management systems on the dynamics and\nstorage of the K provided in fertilizations were evident\n(Figures 3A and 3B).\nThe CSTCM and NTS treatments had the highest\ncontent of exchangeable K in the soil after nine years\n(Figure 3A); however, its distribution in the profile\n(Figure 3B) indicates a different behavior between these\ntreatments. In CSTCM, almost half of the K detected was\nin the layer below 30 cm depth, indicating likelihood for\nleaching. In the NTS, a proportion of almost 70 % remained\nin the topsoil layer (up to 30 cm), showing that this system\nconditioned a more conservative environment for the K\n\n\n**5**\n\n\n**Ferreira et al.** **Potassium reserve in Oxisol**\n\n\n\nsupplied in fertilization. Furthermore, its retention in a\nposition in the profile with greater presence and activity of\ncommercial crops roots can improve the K use efficiency.\nAn important differential in the NTS was the\ninclusion of ruzigrass intercropped with maize and as\nsubsequent crop to soybean, acting as a cover plant and\nimproving K cycling in the system. According to Ferreira\net al. (2018), the use of Poaceae species as cover crops\n(including ruzigrass) after the soybean harvest increases\nbiomass production, providing soil protection and\nstraw for subsequent cotton cultivation under no-till in\nthe Cerrado region. Oliveira et al. (2019) reported that\nmaize intercropped with _Urochloa brizantha_ produces a\nhigh amount of plant residues, in addition to nutrient\ncycling, including K. The same authors reported that\nplant biomass of _U. brizantha_ or ruzigrass accumulated K\nsimilarly to or more than maize.\nWhen compared to annual crops in general,\n_Urochloa_ species develop a root system that penetrates\ndeeper into the soil, with a large volume of roots, enabling\nhigh K absorption (Rosolem et al., 2019), including the\nnon-exchangeable forms (Volf et al., 2018). According to\nR\u00f6mheld and Kirkby (2010), K is transported mainly by\ndiffusion from the soil to the root surface and the presence\nof hairs is crucial in absorption, as it increases the surface\narea of the root cylinder and the concentration gradient\nthat triggers the K influx.\n\n\n\nAfter successive harvests along nine cropping\nseasons in different production systems, the total K\nexport expressed as K 2 O equivalent was estimated\nat 553, 587, 454, and 487 kg ha [\u20131] for total adding of\n1,170, 834, 939, and 939 kg ha [\u20131] of K 2 O via fertilization\nin the treatments CSTCM, CSTCSC, CSTCSM, and\nNTS, respectively. The partial balance between K\ninput and output in the systems indicated surpluses\nand the exported/applied nutrient ratio corresponded\nto relatively low offtake rates, ranging from 47 to\n70 % (Table 3). Thus, K additions by fertilization\nsurpassed the harvest removal in all production\nsystems, especially CSTCM, in which the combined\neffects of CST, absence of crop rotation, and higher K\nfertilization resulted in proportionally greater leaching\nto subsurface layers (Figures 1 and 3B), despite the fine\ntexture in the soil with 495 g kg [\u20131] of clay. The fate of the\nfertilizer K can follow different paths, besides the crop\nuptake, including adsorption in exchangeable positions\non colloids, conversion to non-exchangeable forms,\nand losses by runoff and leaching (Rosolem et al.,\n2019). As the Oxisol is typically well drained and the\nexperiment was installed in a field almost flat, greater\nimportance of leaching can be expected in the potential\nK losses. According to Moterle et al. (2019), when K\nfertilization generates a positive balance that exceeds\nthe soil buffering capacity, the presence of higher\n\n\n\n**Figure 3** \u2013 Equivalent amounts of K 2 O cumulatively supplied by fertilization and stored up to 100 cm depth in the soil profile (A) and proportions of\nexchangeable K retained in the upper and deeper layers (B) of clayey Oxisol, after nine harvests in different cotton production systems. *Stock\nin the soil under native Cerrado vegetation.\n\n\n**Table 3** \u2013 Cumulative crop production (PROD), K 2 O equivalent export (EXP) and partial balance, and offtake rate from K fertilization, after nine\nharvests in different cotton production systems.\n\n\nSeed cotton Soybean Maize\nSystems PROD EXP PROD EXP PROD EXP Total K 2 O EXP K 2 O partial balance [1] Offtake rate [2]\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- kg ha [\u20131 ] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %\n\n\nCSTCM [3] 32,536 553 - - - - 553 617 47\n\n\nCSTCSC [4] 19,251 327 12,980 260 - - 587 247 70\n\n\nCSTCSM [5] 9,850 167 9,711 194 25,220 93 454 485 48\n\n\nNTS [6] 11,635 198 9,898 198 24,527 91 487 452 52\n\n\n1 Difference between the equivalent amounts of K 2 O applied in fertilization and exported in harvests; 2 Ratio between K export and fertilization; 3 Conventional soil\ntillage (CST) with cotton monoculture; [4] CST with annual cotton-soybean-cotton succession; [5] CST with cotton/soybean/maize rotation; [6] no-tillage system with cotton/\nsoybean/maize rotation and ruzigrass as a cover crop.\n\n\n\n**Sci.

Thus, once\na sufficiency level for a given soil type is established,\nfertilizer recommendations closer to the crop needs\nare desirable, in amounts equivalent to K export in\nthe harvested products, which minimizes translocation\ndown the profile and eventual K losses outside the root\nzone (Kaminski et al., 2010).\nBefore the experiment beginning, the exchangeable\nK content was 0.23 cmol c dm [\u20133] in the 0-20 cm layer,\nequivalent to 216 kg ha [\u20131] of K 2 O when assuming a soil\nbulk density of 1.0 kg dm [\u20133] . After nine years under\nthe NTS treatment, subtracting this initial reserve, the\nestimated stock for the same layer corresponded to\n63 % of the surplus of 452 kg ha [\u20131] of K 2 O calculated\nin the balance (Table 3). Among the CST treatments,\ncalculations revealed that the maximum percentage\nretained up to 20 cm was 34 % of the surplus from\nfertilization. Therefore, in addition to making the soil\nprone to lose K through erosive processes, the frequent\ntillage limits SOM accumulation, favoring a disruption\nin the K storage capacity in the topsoil. There is a weak\nK retention strength in highly weathered soils, such the\nCerrado Oxisols, as result of the low frequency of 2:1\nclay minerals to generate negative charges and adsorb\ncations, besides the competition with Ca and Mg derived\nfrom liming on adsorption to colloids (Moterle et al.,\n2019; Rosolem et al., 2019). These conditions make the\nK surplus from fertilization more susceptible to leaching.\nThe mean cotton yields were 3,615, 3,855, 3,285,\nand 3,885 kg ha [\u20131] in CSTCM, CSTCSC, CSTCSM, and\nNTS treatments, respectively. Therefore, the NTS\nused in the present study is recommended. The NTS\nsustainability is supported by more efficient retention\nand storage of surplus K supplied in fertilization, keeping\nit cycling and more concentrated in the profile surface\nwithin the reach of crop roots, providing higher cotton\nyield potential.\nIn the NTS treatment, the combination of\ncotton, soybean, and maize rotation and ruzigrass as\na cover plant, each with different characteristics of\nroot and shoot development, productive potential,\nand life cycles, provided better soil use and K uptake\nfrom fertilization. The inclusion of ruzigrass in this\nno-tillage system promoted deep K recovery in the\nprofile and its maintenance in circulation in the soilplant compartments, by increasing SOM (Santos et al.,\n2014), with consequent improvement in soil K buffering\ncapacity. Thus, this grass sustained K availability in the\nupper layer, where it was retained due to the CEC from\nhigher SOM, reducing losses by leaching.\nAfter absorption, K is stored in the cytoplasm\nand vacuole and does not integrate any structural\ncomponent of the plant cell. With the death of plant\ntissue and presence of enough moisture, the K contained\nin plant residues is quickly released into the soil solution\n(Lupwayi et al., 2006; Rosolem et al., 2019), contributing\nto nutrition of the subsequent crop. These aspects\nreinforce the premise that systems with the presence\n\n\n**Sci. Agric. v.79, n.4, e20200339, 2022**\n\n\n\nof live plants for a longer time throughout the year are\nmore efficient in keeping K availability and minimizing\nlosses.\n\nIn all production systems, K export was lower\nthan the amount supplied by fertilization, generating\na surplus in the nutrient balance (Table 3), which\nincreased soil K availability in the 0-20 cm layer to\nvalues above the critical level of 0.13 cmol c dm [\u20133] (Sousa\nand Lobato, 2004). In these situations, especially in\nmodalities similar to the NTS used in this study, there is\nan opportunity to adjust fertilization in cotton cropping\nsystems to reduce production costs and increase the use\nefficiency of K fertilizer.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nConventional tillage in clayey Oxisol with cotton\nmonoculture favors the leaching of K surplus from\nfertilization. Conversely, no-tillage system with cotton /\nsoybean / maize rotation and the inclusion of ruzigrass\nas a cover plant allows better control of the K dynamics,\nkeeping it in circulation in the root zone and reducing\nlosses by leaching. Increased OM in this system enlarges\nthe K storage capacity in the topsoil. The adoption of\nno-tillage crop systems integrating grass species, such as\n_Urochloa_ _ruziziensis_, is a viable way to improve the use\nefficiency of K fertilizers for cotton cultivation in highly\nweathered tropical soils.\n\n\n**Acknowledgments**\n\n\nThe authors thank the Goi\u00e1s Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o\nGoi\u00e1s) for the operational support and for providing\nthe experimental area for conducting the experiment\nand thank Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation\n(Embrapa) and the Goi\u00e1s Cotton Crop Incentive Fund\n(Fialgo) for partially funding the studies.\n\n\n**Authors\u2019 Contributions**\n\n\n**Conceptualization** : Ferreira, A.C.B.; Borin, A.L.D.C.;\nLamas, F.M. **Data acquisition** : Ferreira, A.C.B.; Borin,\nA.L.D.C. **Data analysis** : Ferreira, A.C.B.; Borin,\nA.L.D.C.; Ferreira, G.B.; Resende, A.V. **Design of**\n**methodology** : Ferreira, A.C.B.; Borin, A.L.D.C.; Lamas,\nF.M.; Resende, A.V. **Writing and editing** : Ferreira,\nA.C.B.; Borin, A.L.D.C.; Resende, A.V.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAlmeida, T.F.; Carvalho, J.K.; Reid, E.; Martins, A.P.; Bissani, C.A.;\nBortoluzzi, E.C.; Brunetto, G.; Anghinoni, I.; Carvalho, P.C.F.;\nTiecher, T. 2021.

We used the\nQUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) model with\n>8000 plot-level observations to estimate the relationship between grain yield\nand nutrient accumulation in above-ground dry matter of irrigated rice with\nharvest index 0.4. Predicted reciprocal internal efficiencies (RIEs) at 60% to\n70% of yield potential corresponded to plant accumulation of 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P,\nand 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain yield. These RIEs enable determination of plant\nrequirements for K and P and net output of K and P in harvested grain and\nremoved crop residues at a target yield. Yield gains for nutrient applied to\nirrigated rice averaged 12% for K and 9% for P for 525 to 531 observations. For\nfields without certain yield gain, fertilizer K and P requirements can be\ndetermined by a partial maintenance approach (i.e., fertilizer input < output in\nnutrient balance), which considers nutrient supply mediated through soil\nprocesses and balances trade-offs between financial loss with full maintenance\nrates and risk of excessive nutrient depletion without nutrient application. When\nyield gains to an added nutrient are certain, partial maintenance plus yield gain\ncan be used to determine fertilizer requirements. The SSNM-based approach and\nalgorithms enable rapid development of field-specific K and P management.\n\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\n\n_Oryza sativa_\n\n\n\n**Keywords** Field-specific nutrient management nutrient balance SSNM rice \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\nwheat \ufffd maize\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nRoland J Buresh\n\n1 International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), DAPO Box 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines;\n\ne-mail:r.buresh@cgiar.org.\nMirasol F Pampolino ChristianWitt \ufffd\nInternational Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), Southeast Asia Program, PO Box 500 GPO,\nPenang 10670, Malaysia\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n_Presented\ufffdat\ufffdIPI-OUAT-IPNI\ufffdInternational\ufffdSymposium._\n_Published\ufffdin\ufffdPlant\ufffdSoil\ufffd2010.335:35-64.\ufffdPrinted\ufffdhere\ufffdwith\ufffdpermission\ufffdfrom\ufffdPlant\ufffdSoil_\n\n\n\n343\n\n\n_**Abbreviations**_ _CRR; crop residue retained: FK; fertilizer K: FM; fraction of full_\n_maintenance: FP; fertilizer P: GY; grain yield: HI; harvest index: IE; internal_\n_efficiency: IGP; Indo-Gangetic Plains: QUEFTS; Quantitative Evaluation of the_\n_Fertility of Tropical Soils: RE; recovery efficiency: RIE; reciprocal internal_\n_efficiency: RTDP; Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity: SSNM; site-_\n_specific nutrient management_\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\n\nRice ( _Oryza sativa_ L.) is the main staple food crop in Asia, which accounts for\nabout 90% of global rice production. Irrigated rice covers half the rice-growing\narea and accounts for about 75% of total rice production (Maclean et al. 2002).\nContinuous rice cultivation with two and occasionally three crops per year is\ncommon in tropical Asia. Rice in rotation with other crops, particularly wheat\n( _Triticum aestivum_ L.), is common in subtropical Asia (Ladha et al. 2009), and\nthe rotation of maize ( _Zea mays_ L.) with irrigated rice is increasing in importance\ninAsia (Ali et al. 2008). Fertilizer use has contributed to increasing production of\nrice-based systems since the Green Revolution, and the effective use of\nsupplemental nutrients remains vital for essential increases in the production of\nrice and associated cereal staples to meet rising demand for food security and\npolitical stability.\nPlots of land for cultivation of rice-based cropping systems in Asia are\ntypically small and spatially variable in management. Large variations in nutrient\nbalances and nutrient requirements can exist across small distances within a\nlandscape due to differences in retention of crop residues, historical fertilizer use,\ninput of organic materials, inherent soil fertility, and crop yield attainable with\nfarmers' management practices. Existing blanket fertilizer recommendations for\nlarge areas or agro-ecological zones fail to account for these variations in crop\nneeds for supplemental nutrients among fields within small distances.\nApproaches and algorithms for tailoring fertilizer requirements to field-specific\nneeds of crops are necessary to further improve productivity and profitability\nfrom fertilizer use.\n\nAlgorithms for determining fertilizer recommendations are often derived\nfrom factorial fertilizer trials conducted across multiple locations. Site-specific\nnutrient management (SSNM) for rice arose in the mid-1990s as an alternative\napproach for dynamic management of nutrients to optimize supply and demand\nof a nutrient within a specific field in a particular cropping season (Dobermann et\nal. 2004). The SSNM approach reasoned that fertilizer requirements should be\nbased on more generic relationships such as internal nutrient efficiency, which is\nthe amount of grain yield produced per unit of nutrient accumulated in aboveground plant dry matter (Witt et al. 1999). The QUEFTS (Quantitative\nEvaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) model developed by Janssen et al.\n\n\n\n(1990) was used to provide a generic empirical relationship between grain yield\nand nutrient accumulation in rice plants (Witt et al. 1999), which was\nsubsequently combined with the estimation of attainable yield, nutrient balances,\nand probable yield gains from added nutrient to determine field-specific fertilizer\nrequirements for rice (Witt and Dobermann 2004).\nThe determination of field-specific fertilizer N requirements in the SSNM\napproach for rice has subsequently been modified to use a target agronomic\nefficiency of fertilizer N use, which is the increase in yield per unit of fertilizer N\napplied, and an estimated field-specific yield gain to applied N (Buresh and Witt\n2007; Witt et al. 2007). The determination of fertilizer K and P requirements in\nthe SSNM approach, on the other hand, has continued to use internal nutrient\nefficiency combined with estimates of attainable yield, nutrient balances, and\nprobable yield gains from added nutrient within specific fields (Witt et al. 2007).\nThe SSNM approach has recently been applied to wheat (Khurana et al. 2008)\nand maize (Witt et al. 2009).\nWitt et al. (2007) advocated use of nutrient balances with full maintenance of\nsoil fertility, in which the applications of fertilizer K and P are sufficient to match\nthe output of the nutrients. Such an approach does not adjust fertilizer K and P\nrates for enhanced availability of nutrients through soil biological, chemical, and\nphysical processes. Moreover, the application of fertilizer at full maintenance can\nresult in financial loss when the crop does not respond to the added nutrient. An\nincrease in farm-gate fertilizer prices relative to the farm-gate price of produce\nfurther increases this financial loss. Failure to apply K or P, on the other hand, can\nresult in nutrient depletion and eventual loss in yield, which could take a number\nof seasons before detection (Abdulrachman et al. 2006). The importance of soil\nbiological, chemical, and physical processes on nutrient availability and the\ndramatic fluctuations in fertilizer prices highlight the need to re-examine full\nmaintenance approaches for determining fertilizer K and P requirements.\nAlgorithms are needed for determining fertilizer K and P rates that effectively\nconsider soil processes and soil characteristics mediating K and P availability and\nbalance the trade-offs between profitability in the short term and sustainable\nproductivity in the longer term.\nTechnological approaches and algorithms for developing fertilizer\nrequirements tailored to field-specific needs of crops in irrigated rice-based\ncropping systems must be based on robust scientific principles applicable across\nthe field-level variability and diversity of crop-growing conditions. At the same\ntime, approaches must be relatively simple with minimal characterization or\ninterviewing of farmers for each field in order to ensure rapid, cost-effective\ndelivery of field-specific guidelines to millions of small-scale farmers.\nTechnological approaches and algorithms should strive to draw upon existing\nresearch information in order to avoid delays in reaching farmers with practical\nsolutions based on scientific principles.\n\n\n\n_Oryza sativa_\n\n\n\n_Triticum aestivum_\n\n\nthe rotation of maize ( _Zea mays_\n\n\n\n344 345\n\n\nNutrient balances and fertilizer requirements determined with SSNM for\nirrigated rice rely on reciprocal internal efficiency (RIE), which is the amount of\nthe nutrient in above-ground plant dry matter per tonne of grain production.\nValues currently used with SSNM for irrigated rice were derived with the\nQUEFTS model by Witt et al. (1999). Given the importance of RIE in\ndetermining fertilizer requirements, there is merit after a decade to re-examine\nwith a larger data set the robustness of RIEs used for irrigated rice.\n\n\nThe objectives of this study are:\n1) To determine, using a large data set for irrigated rice from across Asia, the\nrelationship between rice grain yield and N, P, and K accumulation in total\nabove-ground plant dry matter of mature rice, and through this to confirm\nRIE values for K and P for use in determining fertilizer requirements for\nsemi-dwarf irrigated rice;\n2) To assess at the field level through K and P nutrient balances the factors,\nuncertainties, and emerging trends affecting the determination of fieldspecific fertilizer K and P requirements for rice\u2013rice, rice\u2013wheat, and\nrice\u2013maize cropping systems; and\n3) To examine and compare revised approaches for calculating field-specific K\nand P fertilizer rates that can consider the net effect of soil processes and soil\ncharacteristics mediating K and P availability and balance the trade-offs\nbetween short-term profitability of fertilizer use and longer term\nsustainability of the productivity of high-yielding rice-based systems.\n\n\nWe provide alternatives to factorial field trials and rigid nutrient balances for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P requirements. The framework we present does not\nspecifically consider soil\u2013plant\u2013nutrient interactions and biological processes\nmediating nutrient availability.\n\n\n**Materials and methods**\n\n\nInternal nutrient efficiencies for rice\n\n\nThe QUEFTS model (Janssen et al. 1990) as modified and described by Witt et al.\n(1999) was used with a large data set to develop relationships between grain yield\nand nutrient accumulation in total above-ground plant dry matter of rice at\nmaturity. The data originated from irrigated rice production areas in seven\ncountries across tropical and subtropical environments in Asia (Table 1). Data for\nrice grain yield, harvest index, and plant accumulation of N, P, and K were\ncompiled from various research projects and then grouped into separate data sets\nfor N, P, and K. The data set for each nutrient contained results from all plots with\nmeasurements for both plant accumulation of the nutrient and grain yield\n(Table 1).\n\n\n\n**Table 1** Origin of data used to examine the relationship between rice grain yield\nand accumulation of N, P, and K in total above-ground dry matter at\nmaturity\n\n|Country|Type of experiment|Years|Number of plot-level observations (n)|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Country|Type of experiment|Years|HI = 0.4 to 0.63<br>a|HI = 0.4 to 0.63<br>a|HI = 0.4 to 0.63<br>a|HI = 0.2 to 0.4|HI = 0.2 to 0.4|HI = 0.2 to 0.4|\n|Country|Type of experiment|Years|N|P|K|N|P|K|\n|Bangladesh<br>China<br>India<br>Indonesia<br>Philippines<br>Thailand<br>Vietnam<br>Total|On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-station experiments<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-station experiments<br>On-farm fertilizer trials<br>On-farm nutrient omission trials<br>On-farm fertilizer trials|2000-2002<br>2000-2002<br>2001-2002<br>1998-2002<br>2001-2004<br>1997-2004<br>2001-2002<br>1997-2002<br>2001-2003<br>2001-2002<br>1997-2002<br>1991-2007<br>1997-2000<br>2002-2003<br>1997-2003|153<br> 259<br> 38<br> 415<br> 939<br> 2086<br> 110<br> 602<br> 144<br> 36<br> 616<br> 8279<br> 206<br> 150<br> 1474<br>15507|100<br>325<br>38<br>415<br>936<br>2086<br>72<br>602<br>144<br>36<br>616<br>1781<br>206<br>150<br>1441<br> 8948|99<br>325<br>38<br>415<br>939<br> 2086<br>72<br>599<br>144<br>36<br>616<br> 1783<br>206<br>150<br> 1475<br> 8983|29<br>98<br>3<br>10<br>5<br>110<br> 409<br>80<br>10<br> 68<br> 822|16<br>98<br>3<br>10<br>5<br>110<br>163<br>80<br>10<br>62<br>557|17<br>98<br>3<br>10<br>5<br>110<br> 163<br>80<br>10<br>68<br> 564|\n\n\n\na HI\ufffd=\ufffdharvest\ufffdindex\n\n\nIn each of the seven countries, except Thailand, data originated from both\nnutrient omission trials and fertilizer evaluation trials conducted in farmers'\n\nfields. Data from Bangladesh originated from research described by Alam et al.\n(2005). Data from on-farm trials before 2001 in other countries originated from\nthe Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity project (Dobermann et al. 2002).\nOn-farm data from 2001 onward originated from the subsequent Reaching\nToward Optimal Productivity project in which SSNM was further refined into\nguidelines for rice fertilization (Witt et al. 2007). Data from on-station\nexperiments in the Philippines originated from several long-term experiments\nthat included treatments without application of N, P, or K but ample application\nof other nutrients to meet crop needs. All data were for irrigated rice, and water\nrarely limited plant growth. In all cases semi-dwarf, modern high-yielding indica\ncultivars were grown with good agronomic practices. Comparable\nmethodologies for plant sampling, yield determination, and analysis for plant\nnutrients were used for collected data across the countries and experiments (Witt\net al. 1999).\nInternal nutrient efficiency (IE) is defined as the amount of grain yield in kg\nha (adjusted to 0.14 g water g fresh weight) produced per kg of plant N, P, or K \u20131 \u20131\naccumulation in above-ground plant dry matter expressed on an oven dry basis.\nReciprocal internal efficiency (RIE) is the amount of N, P, or K in the aboveground plant dry matter per 1000 kg of grain production. Harvest index is grain\n\n\n\n346 347\n\n\nyield expressed as a proportion of total above-ground plant dry matter (kg grain\nper kg total above-ground dry matter).\nRelationships between grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation as\npredicted by QUEFTS follow a linear-parabolic-plateau model, which depends\non an established maximum yield potential and coefficients of maximum nutrient\naccumulation (a) and maximum nutrient dilution (d). The a and d coefficients\nused in this paper were the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the measured IE (Witt et\nal. 1999). The predicted model is linear up to about 60% to 70% of the yield\npotential, which is seldom exceeded in farmers' fields. Internal nutrient\nefficiencies determined from the linear portion of the model represent the amount\nof nutrient needed to achieve a grain yield for modern high-yielding rice cultivars\nacross a wide range of yields attainable in farmers' fields (Witt et al. 1999).\nThe RIEs obtained for a data set with the QUEFTS model are intended for\nuse in calculating nutrient balances and fertilizer rates for modern high-yielding\nrice cultivars (Witt and Dobermann 2004) grown in farmers' fields with good\nagronomic practices and balanced use of N, P, and K fertilizers. We therefore\nexcluded from analysis with QUEFTS the data from plots either with suspected\nyield loss due to pests and disease or known to have unbalanced application of\nfertilizer.\n\nHarvest index for the entire data set ranged from 0.2 to 0.63. Low harvest\nindices suggest that disease, weeds, or insect pests resulted in some yield loss.\nLike Witt et al. (1999) and Haefele et al. (2003), we excluded data with harvest\nindex <0.4 from the determination of relationships and internal nutrient\nefficiencies with QUEFTS for semi-dwarf irrigated rice. About 5% of the\nobservations in the entire data set had harvest index <0.4 (Table 1).\nMean and median RIE for N, P, and K are consistently lower for rice grown\nwithout addition of the nutrient (nutrient omission plots) than with full\nfertilization due to dilution of the nutrient in plants not fertilized with the nutrient\n(Table 2). We therefore excluded all nutrient omission plot data from the analysis\nwith QUEFTS. Data from NPK fertilized plots with harvest index from 0.4 to\n0.63 as summarized in Table 2 were used to develop relationships and determine\nRIE with QUEFTS.\n\n\nDetermination of K and P balances\n\n\nSimple nutrient balances for K and P in the absence of fertilizer input were\ndetermined for a single rice crop, one rice\u2013wheat cropping cycle, and one\nrice\u2013maize cropping cycle.

In the yield gain approach, the fertilizer K (FK) or\nfertilizer P (FP) (in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd) required to achieve a targeted yield (GY, expressed in \u20131\nt ha\ufffd\ufffd) is a function of the expected yield gain from the added nutrient, the RIE for \u20131\nthe nutrient, and the use efficiency of the applied nutrient:\nFK = (GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE 0K K [7]\nFP = (GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE 0P P [8]\nwhere GY 0K and GY are grain yield in t ha in the respective nutrient omission 0P \u20131\nplot in which the nutrient of interest is not applied, RIE of a nutrient is determined\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nCR CR\n\n\n\n0K K\n\n\n\nCR K K\n\n\n\n0P P\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nCR P P\n\n\n\n0K 0P\n\n\n\n350 351\n\n\nwith QUEFTS (Table 3), and use efficiency is the recovery efficiency of the\n\n\n\u20131\n\napplied nutrient (RE or RE ) expressed in kg kg\ufffd\ufffd. Because RIE is a constant to K P\nonly 60% to 70% of yield potential, the targeted grain yield should not exceed\nabout 70% of the yield potential when RIE is derived from the linear portion of\nthe QUEFTS model. Current yields of irrigated rice in Asia are generally below\n70% of yield potential (Dobermann et al. 2002).\nWitt and Dobermann (2004), using a data set for irrigated rice from across\n\n\n\u20131\n\nAsia, observed RE ranging from 0.35 to 0.66 kg kg and RE ranging from 0.22 K P\nto 0.35 kg kg between the median and the 75% quartile. Using these values \u20131\ntogether with RIE reported in Witt et al. (1999), they estimated as a general rule\nthat 25 kg K or 9 kg P are required to raise the respective nutrient-limited yield by\n1 t ha\ufffd\ufffd. The data set used by Witt and Dobermann (2004) did not include highly \u20131\nweathered soils (i.e., Oxisols and Ultisols) and volcanic soils (i.e., Andisols) with\nhigh capacity to fix P. P-fixing soils would likely have lower RE P and\ncorresponding higher fertilizer P requirements.\nExpected yield gains from the addition of a nutrient (GY \u2013 GY\ufffd) as obtained 0\nwith the nutrient omission plot technique can be used to determine the need of a\ncrop for fertilizer. We used results from 525 K omission plot trials and 531 P\nomission plot trials conducted in farmers' fields in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,\nand Vietnam (Table 1) to estimate the gain in rice yield from K and P fertilization.\nThe yield gain from application of K or P was determined from the difference in\ngrain yield between a plot with full fertilization of N, P, and K at sufficiently high\nrates to avoid limitation of these nutrients and an adjacent plot without\napplication of K or P (i.e., a nutrient omission plot) but with sufficient amounts of\nother nutrients to prevent their limitations on yield. The full-fertilized and\nnutrient omission plots in a given field were managed identically except for the\nomission of the nutrient of interest in plots without K or P. The difference in grain\nyield between the full-fertilized plot and the nutrient omission plot represents the\nexpected yield gain from addition of the nutrient to overcome the deficit between\nthe crop demand for the nutrient and indigenous supply of the nutrient from\nsources other than fertilizer.\n\nFertilizer K and P requirements to achieve a targeted yield can also be\nestimated with QUEFTS principles through nutrient input-output balances. Witt\nand Dobermann (2004) used the following equations based on nutrient balance to\nestimate fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) requirements (in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd) for a crop \u20131\nwith full maintenance of soil K and P.\n\nFK = (GY x RIE ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE ) \u2013 K K 0K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K L [9]\nFP = (GY x RIE ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE ) \u2013 P P 0P P CR \u2013 P OM [10]\nwhere K CR and P CR are K and P inputs with retained residues, and other inputs and\nlosses are as defined for equations 1 to 4.

Witt and Dobermann (2004) included the expected yield gain from addition\nof a nutrient (GY \u2013 GY\ufffd) in the determination of fertilizer requirements to ensure 0\nthat fertilizer K and P rates in the presence of a yield gain were increased by the\namount of the nutrient uptake deficit to slowly build up soil nutrient supplies.\nIn our study we did not include yield gain in the estimation of fertilizer K and\nP based on a nutrient balance approach. We examined two options using nutrient\nbalances to calculate fertilizer K and P rates based on partial maintenance with\ngradual drawdown or depletion of soil K and P rather than full maintenance of\nsoil K and P. In one option with partial maintenance, fertilizer K and P\nrequirements are calculated as a fraction of full maintenance (FM) as shown in\nequations 11 and 12.\nFK with fractional K depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K ) xFM[11] L\nFP with fractional P depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM ) xFM [12]\nThe other option with partial maintenance allows drawdown of K or P from\n\n\n\u20131\n\nsoil reserves up to a threshold limit (K or P in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd), which is treated as an S S\ninput in the nutrient balance.\nFK with limited K depletion = GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM \u2013 K + S [13]\nFP with limited P depletion = GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM \u2013P S [14]\nThe FM, K, and P terms can be used to estimate the net effect of soil biological, S S\nchemical, and physical processes and soil characteristics on supply of soil K and\nP. When FM = 1 or when K or P = 0, the calculated fertilizer rates for a nutrient S S\n\nensure full maintenance with no drawdown of the nutrient from soil reserves.\n\nWe also combined the partial maintenance and yield gain approaches for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P when crop response to the nutrient is certain.\nFK with fractional K depletion = ((GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K ) x L\nFM) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE ) 0K K K [15]\nFP with fractional P depletion = ((GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM ) x FM) +\n((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE ) 0P P P [16]\nFK with limited K depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM \u2013 K + K ) + S L\n((GY \u2013 GY ) x RIE /RE ) 0K K K [17]\nFP with limited P depletion = (GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM \u2013 P ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x S 0P\nRIE /RE ) P P [18]\nFertilizer K (FK) and P (FP) rates are set to zero whenever the value calculated in\nequations 11 through 18 is negative.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nK CR W OM S\n\n\n\nP CR OM S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nK CR W OM L\n\n\n\n0K K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM\n\n\n\n0P P P\n\n\n\nK CR W OM S L\n\n\n\n0K K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM S 0P\n\n\n\nP P\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nK 0K K CR W OM L\n\n\n\nP 0P P CR OM\n\n\n\nCR CR\n\n\n\n352 353\n\n\nQUEFTS using data from NPK fertilizer plots with harvest index = 0.4 to 0.63\n(Table 2) are shown in Fig. 1abc. The yield potential (10 t ha\ufffd\ufffd) and the limits for \u20131\ndata exclusion (upper and lower 2.5 percentiles) used to determine the functions\nrelating grain yield to the maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) of a\nnutrient are identical to those used by Witt et al. (1999) (Table 3). The IE at\nmaximum accumulation (a) of a nutrient (Table 3) represents the slope of the\nlower boundary line in Fig. 1, whereas the IE at maximum dilution (d) of a\nnutrient (Table 3) represents the slope of the upper boundary line in Fig. 1.\nObservations from nutrient omission plots are shown for no added N in Fig.\n1d, no added P in Fig. 1e, and no added K in Fig. 1f. In each case the presented\nboundary lines and QUEFTS model were derived using data from NPK fertilized\nplots (Table 3). In the absence of a nutrient, many observations concentrated near\n\n\n\nthe upper boundary line for IE, which generally reflects severe nutrient\n\u20131 deficiency. High IE for a nutrient in plots where the nutrient is omitted (Fig. 1def)\ncorresponds to markedly lower RIE for nutrient omission plots than for NPK\nfertilized plots (Table 2). For P and K about 5% of the total plot-level\nobservations were from nutrient omission plots. In these cases, the inclusion of\nnutrient omission plots in the data set had no pronounced effect on the calculated\nRIE. For N, for which 14% of the total plot-level observations were from N\nomission plots, the inclusion of N omission plots in the data set reduced the\ncalculated RIE by 3% (Table 2).\nThe IEs for N, P, and K were relatively low at low harvest indices (Fig. 2). At\nharvest index = 0.2 to 0.4, many observations for the relationship of grain yield\nand plant N, P, or K were concentrated near the lower boundary line determined\nwith QUEFTS using data from NPK fertilizer plots with harvest index = 0.4 to\n0.63. Such low IE in the absence of biotic or abiotic stress would reflect excess or\n\nluxuriant plant uptake of a nutrient. In this study with semi-dwarf, modern highyielding rice cultivars, the low harvest indices probably arose from loss in grain\nyield relative to dry matter production due to non-nutrient constraints such as\ndisease, insect pests, or water deficit. As harvest index increased, the\nobservations increasingly concentrated nearer to the QUEFTS-derived\nrelationship for grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\u20131\n\nas The RIEs for N, P, and K increased with decreasing harvest index (Table 5).\n\nThe effect of harvest index on RIE was most pronounced for K and least\npronounced for P, reflecting the relatively high proportion of plant K and low\nportion of plant P that accumulates in crop residue rather than grain. The reliable\ndetermination of nutrient balances that include nutrient inputs from crop residues\nis consequently relatively more reliant on a robust RIE value for K than for P (see\nequations 5 and 6).\nThe RIE estimated as the mean or median of the data set for NPK fertilizer\n\nplots (Table 2) was larger than the RIE derived from the linear portion of the\nQUEFTS model (Table 3). QUEFTS predicted the balanced nutrient\naccumulation of 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P and 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain across a\nrange of grain yields up to about 70% of the yield potential. The corresponding\nvalues obtained from means for the entire data set were 16.4 kg N, 3.2 kg P, and\n17.8 kg K per tonne of grain (Table 2). The RIEs for nutrients are lower with\nQUEFTS because values derived with QUEFTS are from the slope for only the\nlinear portion of the predicted relationship. This is confirmed by the increase in\nRIE predicted by QUEFTS as target yield increases above 60% to 70% of the\nyield potential (Table 6).\nAn objective of this study was to establish a confirmed robust RIE for N, P,\nand K for use in calculating nutrient balances and fertilizer rates for semi-dwarf,\nhigh-yielding irrigated rice cultivars grown in farmers' fields with good\nagronomic practices and balanced use of nutrient inputs. We therefore sought to\n\n\n\n**Fig. 1** Relationship between rice grain yield and accumulation of N, P, and K in\ntotal above-ground dry matter of rice at maturity, using data from NPK\nfertilizer plots (abc) and nutrient omission plots only (def) with harvest\nindex = 0.4 to 0.63 as described in Table 2.

The exclusion of data from omission plots slightly\nincreased RIE obtained from the linear portion of the QUEFTS prediction. With\nthe exclusion of omission plot data, the RIE for nutrients increased from 14.1 to\n14.6 kg N per tonne of grain, 2.6 to 2.7 kg P per tonne of grain, and 15.6 to 15.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\n\nn\ufffd=\ufffdnumber\ufffdof\ufffdobservations\n\nSD\ufffd=\ufffdstandard\ufffddeviation\n\n\n\n356 357\n\n\nkg K per tonne of grain (data not shown). This suggests that the exclusion of\nomission plot data in the QUEFTS analysis is merited because results from\nomission plots tend to concentrate at near the upper boundary line for maximum\ndilution (Fig. 1def).\nThe IEs for maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) and the RIEs\nobtained with QUEFTS in this study were comparable to values reported by Witt\net al. (1999) using a smaller data set (Table 3).At harvest index of 0.4, which is\ncommon for semi-dwarf, high-yielding rice, the RIE of 14.7 reported by Witt et\nal. (1999) remained essentially unchanged at 14.6 kg plant N per tonne of grain,\nand the RIE of 2.6 reported by Witt et al. (1999) remained essentially unchanged\nat 2.7 kg plant P per tonne of grain. The RIE for K increased slightly from 14.5 to\n15.9 kg plant K per tonne of grain (Table 3). The close match between this study\nand Witt et al. (1999) confirms the robustness of the RIEs from Witt et al. (1999)\nthat have been used for a decade to determine fertilizer K and P requirements\nwithin SSNM for rice (Witt et al. 2007).\nNutrient harvest indices are used to determine nutrient balances when\n\nfractions of the crop residues are retained in the field (see equations 5 and 6). The\nmedian nutrient harvest indices obtained from NPK fertilizer plots were 0.63 for\nN, 0.69 for P, and 0.15 for K (Table 4). These values for rice are consistent with\nreports that grain contains about 60% of the N, 15% to 20% of the K, and about\ntwo-thirds of the P accumulated in above-ground biomass (Dobermann and\nFairhurst 2000).\n\n\nNutrient balances in rice-based cropping systems\n\n\n_Continuous rice cropping_\n\n\n\nfor rice to be harvested near ground level with little retention of standing biomass\nin the field.\n\nThe K balances in Fig. 3 with 15% retention of crop residue represent the\nfrequent situation in South Asia where rice is harvested near ground level, and\ncrop residue after threshing is not returned to the field but rather used for\nalternative purposes such as fodder, fuel, or bedding for animals. Under such\nconditions, the crop removal of K increases with increasing grain yield and\nexceeds 100 kg K ha above 7 t ha\ufffd\ufffd. The K balances in Fig. 3 with 40% retention \u20131 \u20131\nof crop residue represent the frequent situation in Southeast Asia, where some\nstanding biomass is retained in the field at harvest, but crop residue after\nthreshing is not returned to the field. Combine harvesting with complete retention\nof crop residue within fields is practiced in some parts of Asia, and it will likely\nincrease in importance, especially where the supply of labor is limited.\n\n\n**Fig. 3** Potassium balances for one rice crop across a range of grain yields as\naffected by amount of crop residue retained (a), addition of 20 kg K ha \u20131\nwith irrigation water (b), and addition of an additional 20 kg K ha from \u20131\norganic materials (c)\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nContinuous rice cultivation with two or three rice crops per year is common\nacross the tropics of Asia. Rice yields in farmers' fields in the tropics can often\nreach 7 to 8 t ha with good agronomic practices in dry seasons with high solar \u20131\nradiation and ample irrigation water. Rice yields in wet seasons typically achieve\nonly 4 to 6 t ha \u20131 with good agronomic practices because of reduced solar\nradiation and reduced yield potential due to cloudiness. The potential depletion of\nsoil K reserves due to removal of crop residues is a concern in intensive rice\ncropping (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000).\nThe net export of K during rice cultivation with complete retention of crop\nresidue is relatively small even at high grain yields, but removal of crop residues\nresults in substantial export of K (Fig. 3a). Rice in Asia is commonly harvested\nmanually, and the harvested biomass is then transported to a central location for\nthreshing. Within Southeast Asia, some standing biomass (i.e., stubble) is\ntypically retained in the field at harvest, but in South Asia it is relatively common\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nThe K balances in Fig. 3 with 100% retention of crop residue represent fields\nwith combine harvesting without subsequent removal of crop residue. They also\nrepresent fields with manual harvesting and complete return of crop residue to the\nfield after threshing. The burning of rice residues, though increasingly banned for\nenvironmental reasons, is still practiced in some locations. Burning of rice\nresidue spread across a field normally does not result in appreciable loss of K\n(Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000); hence, burning of rice residue is neglected as a\nfactor in the determination of K balances in this study.\nThe K balances assume negligible leaching loss in Fig. 3 (K in equation 1). L\nRice soils in Asia are typically tilled at or near saturated soil water content during\nland preparation by a process called puddling, which destroys soil structure and\n\n\n\n358 359\n\n\nreduces percolation rate and leaching loss of ions, including K (Sharma and De\nDatta 1986). My Hoa et al. (2006) reported only 1 to 3 kg K ha loss by leaching \u20131\nduring a growing season on puddled soil in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. The\ninput of K from rainwater by comparison was 6 to 10 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd. Witt and \u20131\nDobermann (2004) estimated 11 kg K ha loss by leaching and 5 kg K ha input \u20131 \u20131\nfrom rainwater in an approximation of K balances for a typical irrigated rice crop\nin Asia. Percolation rate and leaching loss are higher on coarse-textured soil with\nlow cation exchange capacity (Bijay-Singh et al. 2004), but such soils are much\nless common for rice\u2013rice cropping systems. We therefore assume that leaching\nloss of K approximately matched K input from rainwater and could be treated as\nnegligible.\nPhosphorus balances, unlike K balances, in continuous rice cultivation are\nnot strongly affected by management of rice residue (Fig. 4a). Only about onethird of the total P in a mature rice plant typically remains in the crop residue after\nharvest (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000). The retention of crop residue has only a\nsmall effect on net crop removal of P.All crop residue from rice with 7 t ha grain \u20131\nyield contains only about 5 kg P ha\ufffd\ufffd. \u20131\n\n\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nfrom 1.2 to 3.9 mg L\ufffd\ufffd.

The input of K with irrigation water depends on both the K\nconcentration in added water and the quantity of water added during the entire\ncropping cycle in rice production from the onset of land preparation to harvest.\nThe concentration of K in irrigation water, as shown in Table 7, varies within and\namong rice-growing areas. The median concentration of K in irrigation water\ncollected from eight rice-growing areas across six countries across Asia ranged\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\na n\ufffd=\ufffdnumber\ufffdof\ufffdobservations\n\nb b\ufffdSD\ufffd=\ufffdstandard\ufffddeviation\n\nc Unpublished\ufffddata\ufffdfrom\ufffdIRRI\ufffdReversing Trends\ufffdin\ufffdDeclining\ufffdProductivity\ufffdproject,\n\n1997-2000\n\n\n\nb\n\n\nc\n\n\n\nThe total water input from rainfall plus irrigation for one rice-growing cycle\ncan vary from as little as 400 mm for heavy clay soil with shallow groundwater\ntables that supply water to rice by capillary rise to more than 2000 mm for coarsetextured soil with deep groundwater tables. About 1300 to 1500 mm is a general\nvalue for irrigated rice in Asia (Bouman and Tuong 2001; Bouman et al. 2006).\nRainfall can differ markedly between growing seasons in Asian rice production\nareas with two or three rice crops per year. During monsoonal wet seasons, much\nof the required water can be provided through rainfall. Some irrigated rice areas\ndo not even receive irrigation in the wet season. In the dry season, on the other\nhand, much of the water must be supplied through irrigation.\nWe assume an addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water during one cropping\ncycle. The addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water with 1.8 mg K L, the median \u20131\nK concentration in Table 7, would add 18 kg K ha\ufffd\ufffd. This input of K would \u20131\nincrease with increased use of irrigation water, and it would decrease as rainfall\ncontributed a greater portion of the total required water.\nThe variability in K concentration of irrigation water leads to uncertainty in\nthe input of K for a specific rice field. Results for the two locations in the\nPhilippines in Table 7 illustrate substantial variation in K concentration among\nlocations within a country. The K concentration in irrigation water ranged from\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n360 361\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n0.3 to 1.5 mg L for 13 samples from Bohol and from 2.0 to 6.1 mg L for 22\nsamples from Iloilo (data not shown). The K concentration for 50% of the\nsamples was 1.2 to 1.4 mg L in Bohol and 3.3 to 4.2 mg L in Iloilo. Assuming \u20131 \u20131\nan addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water, K input for 50% of the rice fields\nwould be 12 to 14 kg K ha in the sample area in Bohol and 33 to 42 kg K ha in \u20131 \u20131\nthe sample area in Iloilo. The K inputs for the remaining 50% of rice fields would\nfall outside these ranges. The deficit in K balances, and consequently the amount\nof fertilizer K needed to maintain a non-negative K balance, would differ by\nabout 20 to 30 kg K ha between Bohol and Iloilo at comparable rice yields and \u20131\nfractions of retained rice residue.\n\nResults in Table 7 also illustrate substantial variability in K concentration of\nirrigation water within a rice-growing area. In the case of the Cauvery Delta in\nIndia, the K concentration in irrigation water for 24 samples ranged from 1.0 to\n9.5 mg L (data not shown), and 50% of the samples fell within 1.3 to 3.0 mg L\ufffd\ufffd. \u20131 \u20131\nAssuming an addition of 1000 mm of irrigation water, K input for rice fields\nwould range from 10 to 95 kg ha \u20131 in the sample area with 50% of the fields\nreceiving 13 to 30 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd. This variability within a rice-growing area highlights \u20131\nthe importance of information on K inputs from irrigation water when\ndetermining field-specific fertilizer K rates based on K balances.\nThe K balances in Fig. 3b assume input of 20 kg K ha from irrigation water, \u20131\nwhich, based on results in Table 7, appears likely for irrigated rice in seasons with\nlimited rainfall. Complete retention of crop residue with such input of K from\nirrigation water results in near neutral K balances even at high rice yields. This\nsuggests that K deficiency is unlikely in continuous cultivation of irrigated rice\nwith continual retention of all rice residue, use of irrigation water containing 2\nmg K L\ufffd\ufffd, and negligible K loss by leaching. \u20131\nIrrigation water normally contains negligible P. The P concentration in\nirrigation water samples reported in Table 7 was consistently <0.1 mg L (data \u20131\nnot shown). Irrigation water is consequently not considered a source of\nsignificant P in rice\u2013rice cropping systems.\nIntegrated use of organic materials with manufactured chemical fertilizers is\nrecommended in some rice-growing areas (Mamaril et al. 2009). Organic\nmaterials such as composted animal manure and green manures contain K (Witt\net al. 2007; Mamaril et al. 2009), which contribute to K balances and the supply\nof plant-available K to rice crops. The K balances in Fig. 3c assume input of 20 kg\nK ha \u20131 from organic material, corresponding to 2 t ha \u20131 with 10 g K kg\ufffd\ufffd, in \u20131\naddition to 20 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water. The K deficits and hence likely\nneed for fertilizer K are greatest at high rice yields, especially when little or no\ncrop residue is retained.\nOrganic materials at common levels of availability and application are\nunlikely to eliminate deficits in K balances at relatively high rice yields when\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\ncrop residue is only partially retained. But, at lower rice yields such as <5 t ha\ufffd\ufffd,\nwhich are common for wet seasons, the application of organic materials with\npartial retention of crop residues can result in near neutral K balances (Fig. 3c).\nWhen all crop residue is retained, the application of organic materials can result\nin positive K balances across all rice yields (Fig. 3c).\nThe P from added organic materials can have a marked effect on P balances.\nThe input of 10 kg P ha from organic material, corresponding to 2 t ha with 5 g \u20131 \u20131\nP kg\ufffd\ufffd, can eliminate deficits in P balances at rice yields of <5 t ha \u20131 \u20131 (Fig. 4b).\nOrganic P in added organic materials must be converted to phosphate during\ndecomposition of the organic material to become plant available. As a result of\nthis delayed release of plant-available P from organic materials, a relatively\nsmaller fraction of added P from organic material than from manufactured\nchemical fertilizer would likely be taken up by rice in the season when P is\napplied.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n_Rice\u2013wheat system_\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nThe rice\u2013wheat cropping system is common in the subtropics of South Asia and\nChina. It is the main cereal system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South\nAsia, where it is practiced on 13.5 million ha across Bangladesh, India, Nepal,\nand Pakistan. In the northwestern part of the IGP, the rice\u2013wheat system is highly\nintensive with liberal and often excessive use of irrigation water. There are\nincreasing concerns regarding the sustainability of the system in the northwestern\nIGP due to low use-efficiency of inputs, including fertilizers, depletion of\nirrigation water, and degradation of soil resources (Ladha et al. 2009).\nIn Northwest India, within the northwestern part of the IGP, the groundwater\nused for irrigation of rice\u2013wheat is relatively high in K. Reported K\nconcentrations for 242 samples from tube wells in the central plain region of the\nstate of Punjab in Northwest India ranged from 0.87 to 38.2 mg L with a mean of \u20131\n5.1 mg L \u20131 (Pasricha et al. 2001). This corresponded to an estimated input of\nabout 80 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water for a rice\u2013wheat system. Canal water\nfrom gravity-fed irrigation is relatively lower in K content than water from tube\nwells. Because some farmers use water from both sources during a rice\u2013wheat\ncropping cycle (Erenstein 2009), the input of K with irrigation water depends on\nsource as well as the amount of added water.\n\nSoils for rice\u2013wheat cropping in the northwestern IGP are light textured with\nrapid loss of water by percolation. An abundance of electric and diesel tube wells\nhas enabled considerable extraction of groundwater for rice\u2013wheat production\n(Erenstein 2009). A survey of farmers at sites in Haryana, India and Punjab,\nPakistan revealed use of about 1600 to 1900 mm irrigation water during one rice\nproduction cycle (Erenstein 2009). Much less irrigation water, approximating\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n362 363\n\n\n200 to 300 mm, is used for wheat production (Khurana et al. 2008; Erenstein\n2009). Use for one rice\u2013wheat cropping cycle of an estimated 2000 mm irrigation\nwater originating from a tube-well with 5.1 mg K L would result in input of 102 \u20131\nkg K ha from tube well irrigation. This matches with an estimated 100 kg K ha \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\u20131\n\nyr from irrigation water reported in a long-term rice\u2013wheat experiment at\nLudhiana, Punjab, by Bijay-Singh et al. (2004) in a review of literature. A\nfraction of the added K would likely be lost from the crop rooting zone through\nleaching. An annual input of 75 kg K ha from irrigation water is therefore used \u20131\nin Fig. 5 as a plausible net K input for a typical rice\u2013wheat cropping system in\nNorthwest India.\n\nSoil K in addition to K from irrigation water can be lost by leaching.\nLeaching loss of soil K can be an important output in K balances on soils with\nrelatively high release of K from nonexchangeable pools and minerals, leading to\nhigh concentrations of K in soil solution lost by percolation (Haefele 2001).\nBijay-Singh et al. (2004), in a review of literature, estimated an annual K\nleaching loss of 19 to 31 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, depending on inputs of K, from a rice\u2013wheat \u20131\nsystem on light-textured soil in Punjab. The estimated annual K input from\nrainwater was 5 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd. Annual leaching loss of 20 kg K ha is therefore used in \u20131 \u20131\nFig. 5 to approximate total leaching loss of soil K minus the small input of K from\nrainwater.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nplausible high net input of K with irrigation water. The low net K input of 25 kg\nha in Fig. 5 represents the use of water-saving technology leading to substantial \u20131\nsavings in total water use, enabling the use of primarily canal water rather than\ntube-well water for irrigation.\nWheat residue is often removed from the field for use as fodder in Northwest\n\nIndia, whereas rice residue is less valuable for fodder and is often partially or\ncompletely retained in the field (Mandal et al. 2004). The K balances in Fig. 5a\nwith 15% retention of both rice and wheat residue represent removal of all aboveground crop biomass except for small standing biomass near ground level. Under\nsuch conditions, K balances are negative across all rice grain yields even with\nhigh input of K from irrigation water.\nThe K balances in Fig. 5b with 15% retention of wheat residue and 100%\nretention of rice residue represent a relatively common situation with removal of\nwheat residue but complete retention of rice residue such as after combine\nharvesting. Under such conditions, the K balance is near neutral across all rice\ngrain yields with net input of 125 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water. Annual K\nbalances are somewhat negative (\u201350 to \u201360 kg K ha\ufffd\ufffd) with a plausible common \u20131\nnet input of 75 kg K ha \u20131 from irrigation water. Soils in this region have an\ninherent capacity to release K (Bijay-Singh et al. 2004). The retention of some\ncrop residue, use of relatively large amounts of irrigation water from tube wells,\nand net release of K from soil reserves could contribute to the commonly\nobserved absence of crop response to applied K (Khurana et al. 2008). The\nburning of rice residue would likely not have much effect on the K balances\nbecause residue spread across a field normally does not result in appreciable loss\nof K (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000).\nThe use of water-saving technologies that markedly reduce K inputs from\nirrigation (e.g., input = 25 kg K ha in Fig. 5b) would result in more negative K \u20131\nbalances, suggesting that water-saving technologies could increase the likelihood\nof K deficiency even when rice residue is retained. Water-saving technologies\ncould be combined with retention of wheat residue (Fig. 5c) or use of fertilizer K\nto compensate for reduced input of K from irrigation water. The value of wheat\nresidue for fodder and uses other than a supply of K would need to be assessed\nrelative to the cost of fertilizer K to determine the potential attractiveness of\nwheat residue as a source of K. Our analysis suggests that variation in irrigation\nand residue management among fields can strongly affect K balances, which\ncould have a considerable effect on the estimation of field-specific fertilizer K\nrates in the rice\u2013wheat system.\nThe P balances in the rice\u2013wheat system are consistently negative regardless\nof the quantity of retained crop residue (Fig. 6). The retention of crop residue\nhas less effect on P than K balances because a much smaller fraction of the plant\nP than K remains in crop residue after harvest.

Rice is a well-adapted crop in lowlands in the wet season,\nbut maize can replace rice in the drier or cooler season, especially when\nmarketing opportunities are attractive for maize or irrigation water is limited for\nrice production (Ali et al. 2008).\nThe nutrient balances for one rice\u2013maize cycle in Fig. 7 represent common\nmanagement for a rice\u2013maize system with removal of nearly all above-ground\nbiomass (residue retention = 15%) and retention of some standing rice biomass\nafter harvest (residue retention = 40%). Maize residue is typically not retained\nbecause it is difficult to incorporate during tillage for rice production and the\nincorporated residue with its high C-to-N ratio can lead to immobilization of N\nduring decomposition. The K input from irrigation water is assumed to be only 25\nkg ha because the rice\u2013maize system, unlike rice\u2013wheat in Northwest India, is \u20131\nnot common in areas with high application to rice of tube-well water high in K.\nLeaching loss of K is assumed to be negligible.\n\n\n\nNutrient balances for the rice\u2013maize system are strongly affected by the\nyield of maize (Fig. 7). Hybrid maize in a rice\u2013maize system can achieve a yield\nup to 12 t ha \u20131 with good management practices and a sufficient supply of\nnutrients in farmers' fields (IPNI, unpublished data), which is markedly higher\nthan the achievable yield for either rice or wheat in the same season. At 12 t ha \u20131\nmaize grain, there is a net export of about 200 kg K ha and 40 kg P ha for one \u20131 \u20131\nrice\u2013maize cropping cycle with common residue management practices and\nproduction of 5 t ha rice grain (Fig. 7). The rice\u2013maize system with high maize \u20131\nyield is more extractive of nutrients than rice\u2013rice and rice\u2013wheat systems.\nThe retention of maize residues can markedly reduce the net export from a\nrice\u2013maize cropping system of K but not P (Fig. 8). In the rice\u2013maize cropping\nsystem, rice is typically grown in the wet season when rice yield is often lower\nthan in the dry season. The nutrient balances in Fig. 8 consequently assume a rice\nyield of only 5 t ha \u20131 in the wet season. Retention of maize residues markedly\nreduces but does not eliminate the deficit in K balances when rice residue is not\n\nretained (Fig. 8a). Retention of all maize and rice residues is required to achieve\nnear-neutral K balances (Fig. 8b).\nRetention of rice residues is feasible through either combine harvesting or\nmanual harvesting with retention of standing biomass. Retention of maize\nresidue is problematic because it increases the energy required for tillage before\nrice. Incorporation of maize residue due to its high C-to-N ratio can also have\nshort-term negative effects on N availability to rice due to N immobilization\n(Buresh et al. 2008).

Rice grain yield was 5 t ha in all cases, and K input \u20131\nfrom irrigation water during the cropping cycle was 25 kg ha \u20131\n\n\n\nDetermination of fertilizer K and P rates\n\n\n_Yield gain approach_\n\n\nResults from over 500 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted with irrigated\nrice in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam (Table 1) are presented in Fig.\n9 to provide an example of yield gains attainable for rice from K and P\nfertilization in Asia. Grain yields without K or without P increased in direct\nproportion to yields with full fertilization throughout the range in yields from 3 to\n9 t ha\ufffd\ufffd. Yield gains expressed as a fraction of the yield with full fertilization \u20131\naveraged 12% (slope = 0.88) for K and 9% (slope = 0.91) for P.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n**Fig. 9**\n\n\n\nRelationship between rice grain yields in a plot with full fertilization of\nample N, P, and K and an adjacent plot without application of K or P but\nsufficient amounts of other nutrients to prevent their limitations. Data are\nfrom trials conducted in farmers' fields in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,\nand Vietnam\n\n\n\nrather than tillage to incorporate maize residue, such as through direct dry\nseeding, might provide an alternative to facilitate retention of maize residues in\nthe rice\u2013maize system. In the absence of technologies to facilitate retention of\nmaize residue, higher K deficits and hence higher fertilizer K requirements are\nlikely for the rice\u2013maize system with high-yielding hybrid maize than for the\nrice\u2013rice or rice\u2013wheat system.\nThe P balances are affected more by maize yield than by management of\nmaize and rice residues. The P deficits and hence likely need for fertilizer P\nincrease in direct proportion to the yield of maize (Fig. 8cd).\n\n\n\nIn the yield gain approach for determining fertilizer K and P requirements,\nfertilizer K and P are applied only when a crop response to the nutrient is certain.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, the yield gain for irrigated rice from added K or P is often\nrelatively small to moderate, averaging near 10%. We therefore present yield gains\nof 5%, 10% and 20% in an illustration of fertilizer K and P rates and balances\nacross the feasible range of irrigated rice yields from 3 to 9 t ha (Fig. 10). \u20131\nFertilizer K and P rates were determined using equations 7 and 8 in which\nyield gain (GY \u2013 GY ) at a targeted yield with full fertilization (GY) was 0\ndetermined as the respective fraction (5%, 10%, or 20%) of GY. We used RIEs for\nK (15.9) and P (2.7) as determined by QUEFTS (Table 3) and recovery efficiencies\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n368 369\n\n\n**Fig. 10** Fertilizer K and P rates for rice determined with a yield gain approach\nbased on anticipated yield gain from K or P fertilization, expressed as a\npercentage of the attainable yield with full balanced fertilization. In each\ncase 40% of rice residue was retained in the field, and K input from\nirrigation water during the cropping cycle was 20 kg ha \u20131\n\n\n\nK P\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n0K K\n\n\n\n0P P\n\n\n\nof K (RE = 0.64) and P (RE = 0.3) that correspond to about the 70% quartile for K P\nvalues obtained by Witt and Dobermann (2004) from a large data set for irrigated\nrice in Asia. Fertilizer requirements corresponded to 25 kg K ha and 9 kg P ha to \u20131 \u20131\nraise the respective nutrient-limited yield by 1 t ha . In the estimation of K and P \u20131\nbalances in Fig. 10, we assumed 40% retention of rice residue (CRR = 0.4 in\nequations 5 and 6) and 20 kg K ha \u20131 net input from irrigation water, which\napproximates a likely median value for dry-season rice among sites shown in Table\n7. Leaching loss of K is assumed to be negligible.\nFertilizer K and P requirements determined by the yield gain approach\n(equations 7 and 8) increased with increasing target yield (Fig. 10ac), but the K\nand P rates did not increase sufficiently fast to prevent increasing depletion of soil\n\n\n\nfertility with increasing yield within the ranges of yield gain common for\nirrigated rice (Fig. 10bd). The same trends of increasing fertilizer rates and\ndecreasing nutrient balances with increasing yield occur when lower recovery\nefficiencies (RE K = 0.35 and RE = 0.22) corresponding to median values P\nreported by Witt and Dobermann (2004) were used to determine fertilizer\nrequirements (data not shown).\nA distinctly undesirable feature of fertilizer K and P rates determined by the\nyield gain approach is higher K and P depletion at high than low target yields.\nThis could accelerate the onset of nutrient limitations and subsequent declines in\nproductivity in existing high-yielding areas. For both K and P, the slope for\nestimated nutrient balances with increasing yield became less negative as yield\ngain increased from 5% to 20%. Yield gains >20%, which are not common for\nirrigated rice (Fig. 9), would be required to obtain slope = 0 (Fig. 10), at which\npoint nutrient depletion would be constant across yields.\nAlthough Fig. 10 presents results for rice, the same trends would apply to\nwheat and maize. Cereal-growing areas with high-yielding crops and relatively\nsmall current yield gain from K and P fertilization \u2014 and hence low fertilizer K\nand P recommendations based on a yield gain approach \u2014 would be particularly\nprone to nutrient mining and risk of declining productivity. For K, because of the\nlarge portion of total plant K in crop residues, the risk would be greater in highyielding fields with removal than with retention of crop residues. Locations with\nexisting large yield gains from K and P fertilization would be relatively less at\nrisk of further K and P mining from fertilizer K and P recommendations based\nsolely on a yield gain approach.\nThe determination of fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) (in kg ha\ufffd\ufffd) required \u20131\nto achieve a targeted yield (GY, expressed in t ha\ufffd\ufffd) by the yield gain approach can \u20131\nbe simplified by replacing RIE/RE in equations 7 and 8 with a target agronomic\nefficiency (AE) for the nutrient:\nFK = (GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE 0K K [19]\nFP = (GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE 0P P [20]\nwhere agronomic efficiency of the applied nutrient (AE or AE ) is expressed as K P\nkg increase in grain yield per kgapplied nutrient. The determination with SSNM\nof fertilizer N requirements uses a comparable yield gain approach with\nagronomic efficiency (Witt et al. 2007). The target fertilizer requirements of 25\nkg K and 9 kg P to raise the respective nutrient-limited yield by 1 t ha \u20131\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\ncorrespond to AE = 40 kg kg and AE = 110 kg kg\ufffd\ufffd. This AE is derived from a K P P\ndata set without P-fixing soils, and it would likely be lower for soils with high\ncapacity to fix P.\n\n\n\n_Nutrient maintenance based on nutrient balance approach_\n\n\nThe nutrient balance approach based on full or partial maintenance of nutrient\n\n\n\nK P\n\n\n\nK P\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nK P P\n\n\n\n370 371\n\n\ninput-output balances provides an alternative to the yield gain approach for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P requirements. With full maintenance (FM = 1 in\nequations 11 and 12), the fertilizer K or P rates match removal of K or P, ensuring\nno nutrient depletion (depletion = 0 in Fig. 11). Full maintenance rates of a\nnutrient fail to consider enhanced nutrient availability from soil biological,\nchemical, and physical processes. They can also result in short-term financial loss\nfor farmers when the yield gain resulting from application of the nutrient is\nnegligible or small. But, failure to apply the nutrient leads to nutrient depletion,\nwhich might eventually lead to yield loss. Application of fertilizer K and P at less\nthan full (i.e., partial) maintenance rates could then provide an opportunity to\nconsider the supply of nutrient from soil reserves, including contributions from\nbiological processes, and better handle the tradeoffs between longer-term\n\n\n**Fig. 11** Fertilizer K and P rates for rice determined with a nutrient balance\napproach allowing three contrasting amounts for K and P depletion. In\neach case 40% of rice residue was retained in the field, and K input from\nirrigation water during the cropping cycle was 20 kg ha \u20131\n\n\n\nsustained productivity and short-term financial benefit.\nOne option for determining fertilizer rates at partial maintenance is to allow a\ndrawdown or depletion of soil nutrient reserves equivalent to a fraction of the\nnutrient required for full maintenance of the nutrient input-output balance. This\noption, which we refer to as fractional depletion, is illustrated in Fig. 11 for\nfertilizer K and P rates determined at 50% of full maintenance (depletion = 50%;\nFM = 0.5 in equations 11 and 12). Fertilizer rates increased with increasing target\nyield (Fig. 11ac), but the K and P rates did not increase sufficiently fast to prevent\nincreasing depletion of soil K and P with increasing yield (Fig. 11bd). Nutrient\ndepletion and risk of declining productivity are higher at high than low target\nyields with this option of partial maintenance.\nAnother option for determining fertilizer rates at partial maintenance is to\nallow depletion of a nutrient up to but not beyond a threshold limit (K and P in S S\nequations 13 and 14). In this option, which we refer to as limited depletion, the\nthreshold limit represents the estimated drawdown of soil nutrient reserves that\ncould be sustained without leading to more nutrient limitations on crop yield. The\nallowable drawdown of soil nutrient reserves (FM in fractional depletion option\nand K and P in limited depletion option) could depend upon soil processes like S S\nsoil biological activity as affected by water regime (Turner and Haygarth 2001)\nand tillage (Lorenz et al. 2009), equilibrium among nutrient pools (Singh at el.\n2002; Saleque et al. 2009), and soil characteristics like mineralogy (Bijay-Singh\net al. 2004). Fig. 11 illustrates conditions in which the limits for drawdown of soil\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\nnutrient reserves were 30 kg K ha (K ) and 8 kg P ha S (P ). Rice residue S\nretention was 40%, net K input from irrigation water was 20 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, and leaching \u20131\nloss of K was negligible.\nWith the limited depletion option, fertilizer rates (Fig. 11ac) are calculated\nsuch that nutrient balances (Fig. 11bd) are never more negative than the limit for\ndrawdown of soil nutrient reserves (K S and P ). No fertilizer K or P is S\nrecommended at low yields (Fig. 11bd). Fertilizer K or P is recommended only\nabove the yield at which the net output of the nutrient in the nutrient balance\nexceeds K or P (equations 13 and 14). The relatively comparable level of S S\nnutrient depletion across yields and the absence of increasing nutrient depletion\nat high yields make the limited depletion option for partial maintenance\n(equations 13 and 14) more attractive than the fractional depletion option\n(equations 11 and 12) for determining fertilizer K and P across environments with\nwidely varying yields.\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\n_Partial maintenance plus yield gain approach_\n\n\nUse of the partial maintenance approach to determine fertilizer requirements\nrisks applying insufficient nutrient to meet crop needs when yield gain to the\n\n\n372 373\n\n\nadded nutrient is large, but use of the yield gain approach by itself can result in\nnutrient depletion at high yields (Fig. 10bd). A combination of the two\napproaches was therefore examined for determining fertilizer requirements when\nyield gain from added nutrient is certain.\nIn Fig. 12 the fertilizer K and P rates and balances for a partial maintenance\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\napproach with limited depletion (K = 30 kg K ha and P = 8 kg P ha\ufffd\ufffd) are S S\ncompared alone (equations 13 and 14) and in combination with a yield gain\napproach (equations 17 and 18). Yield gain was either set at 20% of attainable\n\n\n\u20131\n\nyield (GY \u2013 GY = 0.2GY) or at a constant 1 t ha (GY \u2013 GY = 1). In Fig. 13 the 0 0\n\n\n**Fig. 12** Fertilizer K and P rates for rice determined with a partial maintenance\nplus yield gain approach in which maximum K and P depletion does not\nexceed a threshold limit from the soil nutrient reserves.

As in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, rice residue retention was 40%, net K input from \u20131\nirrigation water was 20 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, and leaching loss of K was negligible. \u20131\nFertilizer rates were lowest when determined with only a partial maintenance\napproach (Fig. 12ac and 13ac). Combining partial maintenance with a yield gain\napproach resulted in higher calculated fertilizer rates and more positive K and P\nbalances (Fig. 12bd and 13bd). Fertilizer rates with a partial maintenance plus\nyield gain approach increased faster with increasing yield when yield gain was\nexpressed as a fraction of attainable yield (i.e., 20%) rather than as a fixed amount\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n374 375\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n(i.e., 1 t ha\ufffd\ufffd). The K and P balances as a result were more positive at higher yields\nwhen yield gain was expressed as a fraction of attainable yield (i.e., 20%).\nBased on results from nutrient omission plot studies (Fig. 9), the yield gain of\nrice from K and P fertilization is directly related to the attainable yield with full\nfertilization. Yield gain is consequently better represented across a wide range of\nyields as a fraction of the attainable yield (i.e., 20% in Fig. 12 and 13) rather than\na fixed amount (i.e., 1 t ha\ufffd\ufffd). Based on data in Fig. 9, for example, at 5 t ha \u20131 \u20131\nattainable yield with full fertilization, the mean yield gain was 0.6 t ha \u20131 for K\napplication and 0.5 t ha \u20131 for P application; at 8 t ha \u20131 attainable yield with full\nfertilization, the mean yield gain was 1.0 t ha for K application and 0.7 t ha for \u20131 \u20131\nP application.\nThe results suggest that at low rice yields when the yield gain from applied K\nor P is relatively small such as 0.5 t ha\ufffd\ufffd, which often corresponds to yields of \u20131\n<5 t ha \u20131 (Fig. 9), fertilizer requirements can be determined with only a partial\nmaintenance approach (Fig. 11). When yield gain is more pronounced, a partial\nmaintenance plus yield gain approach can be considered for determining\nfertilizer requirements (Fig. 12 and 13). Expressing yield gain as a fraction of\ntargeted yield helps ensure a good fit with measured yield gains (Fig. 9), and it\nhelps ensure that the input of nutrient at higher yields is relatively higher and\nsufficient to overcome nutrient deficiencies.\n\nThe determination of fertilizer K (FK) or fertilizer P (FP) by a partial\nmaintenance plus yield gain approach can be simplified by replacing RIE/RE in\nequations 15 to 18 with a target agronomic efficiency (AE) of the nutrient.\nEquations 15 and 16 for the fractional depletion option become:\nFK = ((GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM + K ) x FM) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) [21] L 0K K\nFP = ((GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM ) x FM) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) 0P P [22]\nEquations 17 and 18 for the limited depletion option become:\nFK = (GY x RIE \u2013 K K CR \u2013 K \u2013 K W OM \u2013 K + K ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) [23] S L 0K K\nFP = (GY x RIE \u2013 P P CR \u2013 P OM \u2013 P ) + ((GY \u2013 GY ) x 1000/AE ) S 0P P [24]\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\nof soil processes and soil characteristics mediating K and P supply when yield\ngain from the applied nutrient is uncertain. The use of nutrient balances across a\nfull range of plausible yields enables fertilizer K and P requirements to be\nadjusted for field-specific yield and management, such as amounts of retained\ncrop residue and applied organic materials, which affect inputs and outputs of K\nand P.\n\nThe SSNM-based approach for determining fertilizer requirements is well\nsuited for small, heterogeneous landholdings typical of rice-based cropping\nsystems in Asia where fertilizer requirements can vary greatly among nearby\nfields and the yield gain from applied K or P is often uncertain. Nutrient balances\ncan provide a pragmatic estimate of nutrient inputs and outputs for a field plot,\nwhich can then be used for determining fertilizer K and P requirements for the\nspecific field. Numerous practices including tillage, management of crop\nresidues and organic materials, and water management can influence soil\nbiological activity and nutrient availability. Their net effect on K and P supply can\nbe considered through K and P in partial nutrient balances (equations 13, 14, 23, S S\nand 24). Research is needed to quantify the net effect of soil processes and soil\ncharacteristics on the sustainable drawdown of soil K and P reserves (K and P ) S S\nused in the determination of fertilizer K and P requirements.\nWhereas nutrient balances are essential for determining SSNM-based\nfertilizer K and P requirements, nutrient balances are not used for determining\nSSNM-based fertilizer N requirements. With SSNM, fertilizer N requirements\nare based on the yield gain from applied N (Witt et al. 2007) because rice and\nother cereal crops in irrigated environments virtually always respond to fertilizer\nN. The SSNM-based approach enables yield gain from applied fertilizer N, and\nhence total fertilizer N requirement, to be adjusted for management practices. It\nalso provides decision tools such as the leaf color chart for dynamically adjusting\nthe application of N during the growing season to match crop needs for\nsupplemental N (Alam et al. 2005), which can be influenced by the effects of\nmanagement on availability of soil N.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nS S\n\n\n\nK CR W OM L 0K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM 0P P\n\n\n\nK CR W OM S L 0K K\n\n\n\nP CR OM S 0P P\n\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nThe SSNM-based approach and algorithms we present for determining fertilizer\nK and P requirements provide an alternative to soil-test approaches (Slaton et al.\n2009) that use algorithms derived from fertilizer response trials conducted across\nmultiple locations. The SSNM-based approach through the use of nutrient\nbalances enables the determination of fertilizer K and P requirements when the\nyield gain from the applied nutrient is negligible or uncertain (Witt and\nDobermann 2004; Witt et al. 2007), which periodically occurs for irrigated rice\nespecially at lower yields (Fig. 9). In this paper we revise the SSNM-based\napproach to accommodate partial nutrient balances, which consider the net effect\n\n\n\nInternal nutrient efficiencies for rice\n\n\nField-specific requirements of a cereal crop for fertilizer K and P can be\ncalculated using RIE to estimate nutrient accumulation by a crop (Witt and\nDobermann 2004). The RIE values obtained for rice in our study using QUEFTS\nmatched well with RIE values reported by others (Witt et al. 1999; Haefele et al.\n2003) for rice with harvest index 0.4, grown with balanced fertilization and\ngood agronomic management. This consistency in RIE across diverse irrigated\nrice-growing environments and cultivars provides confidence that one RIE per\nnutrient can be used for semi-dwarf irrigated rice in determining fertilizer P and\n\n\n\n376 377\n\n\nK requirements when fertilization is balanced to match crop needs.\nDeviations in RIE from the estimation with QUEFTS arise from unbalanced\nplant nutrition leading to either nutrient accumulation associated with luxuriant\nuptake of the nutrient or nutrient dilution associated with nutrient deficiency.\nDeviations in RIE can also arise from biotic or abiotic stresses that adversely\naffect grain production leading to low harvest index. The desired RIE value for\nuse in determining fertilizer P and K requirements reflects an optimal\naccumulation of the nutrients in a mature crop without biotic and abiotic stress.\nThe RIE increases slightly as targeted yield increases above 60% to 70%\nyield potential, which is common in farmers' fields, to 80% of yield potential,\nwhich represents a likely upper limit to profitable rice production (Table 6). But\nthis change in RIE is relatively small ( 7%) compared to other inherent\nuncertainties associated with the determination of fertilizer rates such as\n\nestimation of the attainable yield, yield gain, and some components of the\nnutrient balance such as K addition from irrigation water. The use of RIE at 60%\nto 70% of yield potential therefore appears appropriate for determing fertilizer\nrequirements for irrigated rice.\nSemi-dwarf, high-yielding irrigated rice without biotic or abiotic stresses has\nharvest index 0.4, which was the lower limit of harvest index used by Witt et al.\n(1999), Haefele et al. (2003), and our study. We propose that 14.6 kg N, 2.7 kg P,\nand 15.9 kg K per tonne of grain (Table 3) and nutrient harvest indices of HI = K\n0.15 and HI = 0.7 (Table 4) obtained from a large data set in our study and P\ncomparable to values reported by others (Witt et al. 1999, Haefele et al. 2003) can\nserve as standards for use in determining nutrient balances and associated P and\nK fertilizer rates with semi-dwarf, high-yielding irrigated rice grown with good\nagronomic practices and sufficient water. Alternative RIE values would be\nrequired for rice cultivars with harvest index <0.4 (Table 5).\nSome rice in rainfed areas can have harvest index <0.4 and corresponding\nincreased accumulation of plant nutrient in above-ground dry matter per tonne\ngrain yield. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2008), for example, in a fertilizer trial with\nrainfed rice in West Bengal in eastern India, reported mean harvest index = 0.32\nand mean accumulation of 33 kg K and 4.3 kg P per tonne of grain. In a multilocation trial in Thailand with 624 observations for traditional tall rice cultivars,\nNaklang et al. (2006) reported median harvest index = 0.28 and median plant\naccumulation of 48 kg K and 4.7 kg P per tonne of grain. In both studies the rice\nyields were relatively low (<4 t ha\ufffd\ufffd). The higher RIE reported for traditional-type \u20131\nrice by Naklang et al. (2006) than found for semi-dwarf modern rice such as in\nWitt et al. (1999) and our study resulted from differences in harvest index rather\nthan differences in tissue concentration of nutrients between the two types of rice.\nThe RIE estimated from the mean or median of a data set (Table 2) tends to\nbe higher than the RIE estimated from the linear portion of the QUEFTS model\n\n\n\n(Table 3), which reflects a more balanced uptake of nutrient by the crop. We\ntherefore recommend use of the QUEFTS model with a relatively large data set\nfrom across rice-growing areas to estimate RIE for rice cultivars with harvest\nindex <0.4. The estimated RIE for K and P can then be used in calculating\nnutrient balances and fertilizer rates for rice cultivars \u2014 for a given range in\nharvest index \u2014 grown with balanced use of nutrient inputs and good agronomic\npractices. Data from crop-growing situations with either luxuriant uptake of\nnutrients, such as arising from excessive fertilization, or nutrient deficiency are\ntherefore preferably omitted from the data set used with QUEFTS.\n\n\nNutrient balances in rice-based cropping systems\n\n\nPotassium balances in rice-based systems are strongly affected by the attained\ncrop yield and fraction of crop residue retained, which can vary from field to\nfield. An immediate opportunity for improving the profitability and effectiveness\nof fertilizer K use is consequently to enable field-specific adjustments in fertilizer\nK rates based on probable yield and fraction of crop residue retained in a specific\nfield. Fertilizer K rates for a field could then be further adjusted based on the use\nof externally produced organic materials. Whereas organic materials are often\npromoted for their N benefit, the K inputs from organic materials can be\noverlooked. From the perspective of K balances and maintenance of soil K\nfertility, the application of organic materials to rice is more warranted when crop\nresidues are removed rather than retained. Full retention of rice residue with the\n\napplication of organic materials can potentially result in positive K balances (Fig.\n3c).\nIrrigation water can be an unknown but important input of K in rice\nproduction because of the large quantity of water applied to rice. Uncertainties\nassociated with K concentration in irrigation water and quantity of added\nirrigation water, which can vary from field to field, present a challenge for\nimproving K management and adjusting fertilizer K rates for field-specific\nconditions. The K concentration in irrigation water depends on the source of the\nwater. It is often higher in water from tube wells than from canals in gravity-fed\nirrigation systems (Pasricha et al. 2001), but it can vary among gravity-fed\nirrigation systems as illustrated by the contrast between Bohol and Iloilo in the\nPhilippines (Table 7).\nThe adjustment of fertilizer K requirements to field-specific yields and\nresidue retention can be relatively straightforward because farmers know their\nfield-specific yields and residue management practices. The K input through\nirrigation water, on the other hand, will not be known to farmers. An adjustment\nin fertilizer K requirements for inputs from irrigation water would likely need to\nbe made across a region rather than for a specific field. One option could be to\nestimate, across an entire gravity-fed irrigation system or across all tube wells in\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n378 379\n\n\na region, a probable net K input based on approximate K concentration of the\nwater and typical amount of irrigation water used in a cropping season. This\nestimated probable K input could then be used to adjust nutrient balance-based K\nfertilizer rates across fields for the irrigation system or region. Although such an\nadjustment in fertilizer K rates would undoubtedly contain much uncertainty, it\nwould be superior to the current situation in which net K input from irrigation\nwater is either ignored or assumed to be constant across a country.\nPhosphorus balances in rice and rice-based systems are strongly affected by\nattained crop yield. Residue retention has relatively little effect on P balances and\nhence fertilizer P requirements determined through nutrient balances because of\nthe relatively low P content of residue compared with grain. An immediate\nopportunity for improving the profitability and effectiveness of fertilizer P use is\nconsequently to enable field-specific adjustments in fertilizer P rates based on\nprobable yields.\nFertilizer P rates at the field level could then be further adjusted based on the\nuse of organic materials, which, when relatively rich in P, can contribute to P\nbalances (Fig. 4). Uncertainty exists regarding P supply from organic materials\nbecause organic materials can vary greatly not only in P concentration but also in\nthe rate of release of plant-available P. The supply of P from organic materials at\nleast in the short term is probably less than from manufactured chemical\nfertilizer, in which case one unit of P from organic materials would substitute for\nless than a comparable unit of P from manufactured chemical fertilizer. The\neffectiveness in replacing P from manufactured chemical fertilizer might\nincrease, however, through longer-term application of organic materials.\nAppropriate adjustment in fertilizer P rates for P supplied by added organic\nmaterials is consequently a challenge.\nHigh input of K through irrigation water together with supply of K from soil\nhas likely contributed to the long-term production of rice\u2013wheat in Northwest\nIndia (Fig. 5) with little or no response to fertilizer K (Khurana et al. 2008). The\nintroduction of practices that markedly reduce the use of tube-well water, such as\nresource-conserving technologies (Ladha et al. 2009), could lead to more\nnegative K balances and increased need for fertilizer K (Fig. 5). The monitoring\nof changes in K balances and fertilizer K needs arising from the adoption of\nwater-saving technologies in areas with high use of tube-well water rich in K is\nmerited.\n\nPotassium deficiencies in the rice\u2013wheat system are more likely in areas with\nlittle K input from irrigation water and limited retention of crop residues.\nAlthough K is high in irrigation water from tube wells in the northwestern IGP\n(Pasricha et al. 2001), irrigation water can be lower in K in other rice\u2013wheat areas\nof the IGP. Analysis of 21 samples of irrigation water from tube wells in\nrice\u2013wheat areas of Uttaranchal, India, for example, revealed relatively low K\nconcentration ranging from 0.8 to 2.8 mg L\ufffd\ufffd, with a median of 1.3 mg L \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n(unpublished data, IRRI Reversing Trends in Declining Productivity project,\n1997\u20132000). At these K concentrations, the K input from irrigation water for a\nrice\u2013wheat cropping cycle would approximate 25 kg ha\ufffd\ufffd, leading to markedly \u20131\nnegative K balances regardless of residue retention (Fig. 5).\nThe rice\u2013maize cropping system, because of the high yields of hybrid maize,\ncan be a large net exporter of K and P (Fig. 7). The conversion of rice\u2013rice or\nrice\u2013wheat to rice\u2013maize cropping could lead to a rapid depletion of soil K and P\nif K and P fertilizer are not appropriately adjusted to account for the higher crop\nproduction and plant accumulation of nutrients. Guidelines for determining fieldspecific K and P requirements that optimally balance the trade-offs between\nshort-term profitability and longer-term sustainable productivity can therefore be\nespecially important for the emerging high-yielding rice\u2013maize system. Based on\nK balances, fertilizer K needs could be particularly high when maize residue is\nnot retained in the field either because of off-field value such as for fodder or\n\nbecause it is a nuisance during subsequent tillage and establishment practices for\nrice (Fig. 8b).\n\n\nDetermination of fertilizer K and P rates\n\n\nThe established RIE for K and P for a crop (i.e., 2.7 kg P and 15.9 kg K per tonne\nof grain for rice, Table 3) can be used to determine fertilizer P and K requirements\nthat are based on a targeted attainable yield, nutrient balances, and anticipated\nyield gain from the added nutrient. When yield gain from an added nutrient is\nsmall or negligible, the application of nutrient would not be recommended with\nsolely a yield gain approach (equations 7 and 8), but the failure to apply any\nnutrient could result in rapid nutrient depletion, especially at high yields (Fig. 10\nbd). A nutrient maintenance approach based on nutrient balances, on the other\nhand, would recommend application of nutrient even when yield gain is not\ncertain.\n\nUse of a full maintenance approach (equations 9 and 10) as advocated by\nWitt and Dobermann (2004) and Witt et al. (2007) for rice can result in relatively\nlarge applications of the nutrient, which would be unprofitable in the absence of a\nyield gain from the added nutrient. A partial maintenance approach, rather than a\nfull maintenance approach, for determining fertilizer requirements can include an\nestimate of nutrient supply as affected by soil processes and soil characteristics\nand provide an option to balance the trade-offs between longer-term sustained\nproductivity and short-term profitability.\nThe merit of a partial maintenance approach for determining fertilizer K\nrequirements can be illustrated with results from a long-term fertilizer\nexperiment with two rice crops per year in West Java, Indonesia (Abdulrachman\net al. 2006). The yield loss from not applying fertilizer K during the initial five\nyears (10 crops) was not statistically significant or certain to farmers in any\n\n\n\n380 381\n\n\nseason. Use of a yield gain approach in such a situation would result in no use of\nfertilizer K. Yet, the cumulative yield loss without fertilizer K for the 10 crops\nwas 3 t ha or 0.3 t ha crop\ufffd\ufffd. Use of a full maintenance approach would result in \u20131 \u20131 \u20131\nmean application of about 30 kg K ha for each crop, which could be financially \u20131\nunattractive with probable farm-gate prices for fertilizer and produced rice. Use\nof a lower fertilizer K rate based on an estimated sustainable extraction of K from\n\nsoil reserves (i.e., partial maintenance using K in equation 13) and considering S\nthe farm-gate price of harvested rice relative to the farm-gate fertilizer price\ncould help ensure a balance between short-term profitability and longer-term\nsustained productivity without a yield loss due to K deficiency.\nWe consequently recommend use of a partial maintenance approach for\ndetermining fertilizer K and P requirements when yield gain from an added\nnutrient is small or negligible. Based on the results of analyses in our study, we\nrecommend a partial maintenance approach in which fertilizer rates are\ncalculated to ensure that the depletion of the nutrient does not exceed a threshold\nlimit (K and P ) regardless of yield (equations 13 and 14). This avoids the risk of S S\nincreasing nutrient depletion with increasing yield.\nWhen a detectable yield gain from an added nutrient is certain, an approach\nother than solely maintenance or yield gain appears merited. Witt and\nDobermann (2004) and Witt et al. (2007) combined full maintenance of soil\nfertility and yield gain approaches to determine fertilizer K and P requirements.\nThey did not sum the fertilizer rates determined from full maintenance and yield\ngain approaches. Rather, they separately calculated fertilizer K or P rates with the\ntwo approaches and then selected the larger of the two calculated values as the\nfertilizer requirement. In this fashion the nutrient recommendation was never less\nthan full maintenance and was potentially higher than full maintenance when\nyield gain from the added nutrient was appreciable.\nThe full maintenance plus yield gain approach of Witt and Dobermann\n(2004) and Witt et al. (2007) can result in a relatively large application of nutrient,\nwhich can potentially be unprofitable when farm-gate fertilizer prices are high\nrelative to the farm-gate price of produced grain and crop response to the nutrient\nis modest. Based on the analyses in our study, we consequently recommend a\npartial maintenance plus yield gain approach to determine fertilizer requirements\nwhen the crop responds to the added nutrient. The calculated fertilizer\nrequirement is the sum of the amount determined by partial maintenance and\nyield gain (equations 15 to 18 and equations 21 to 24). Calculated fertilizer\nrequirements can result in positive nutrient balances, but the fertilizer rates can\nalso result in slightly negative nutrient balances (Fig 12 bd and 13 bd) because\nmaintenance is only partial. Our analysis highlighted the merit of expressing\nyield gain as a fraction of targeted yield rather than an absolute amount, because\nmeasured yield gains from fertilizer K and P across a wide range of yields\n\n\n\n\u20131 \u20131 \u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\napproximate a fraction of the yield with full fertilization (Fig. 9).\nThe procedures and algorithms presented for determining fertilizer K and P\nrequirements for rice can also be used for wheat and maize with appropriate RIEs\ndetermined by QUEFTS for the crops. The threshold limit for nutrient extraction\nfrom soil reserves (K and P ) could differ between rice and wheat or maize S S\n\nbecause the release of soil nutrients can differ between saturated anaerobic soils\n\nin rice cultivation and aerobic soils in wheat and maize cultivation. Soil\n\nsubmergence in rice cultivation, for example, tends to increase P availability\n(Turner and Gilliam 1976), which might conceivably affect the limit of\nsustainable nutrient extraction from soil reserves as well as the yield gain of a\ncrop from fertilizer P. For rice\u2013wheat and rice\u2013maize systems, this can influence\nthe optimal distribution of fertilizer P between rice and the non-rice crop in the\nrotation (Gill and Meelu 1983).\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nFertilizer K and P requirements for a specific field can be determined with an\nSSNM-based approach using attainable target yield, nutrient balances, and\nprobable yield gains from added nutrient. One standardized RIE value per\nnutrient for a crop facilitates the determination of nutrient balances in the\nalgorithms. The partial maintenance and partial maintenance plus yield gain\napproaches that we have presented can be used in computer-based decision tools\nsuch as Nutrient Manager for Rice (IRRI 2010), which is designed to quickly\nprovide extension workers, crop advisors, and farmers with fertilizer best\nmanagement practices for specific rice fields. Each decision tool consists of\nquestions readily answered within 15 minutes without the need for soil analysis.\nThe responses to the questions provide sufficient information to develop fieldspecific fertilizer K and P recommendations using approaches and algorithms we\nhave described in this paper. The generic SSNM-based principles and algorithms\nwe presented for K and P are well suited for the rapid development and extension\nof field-specific fertilizer recommendations for rice, and they can be readily\nadapted for use with wheat and maize.\n\n\n**Acknowledgme** nt The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),\n\nthe International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), the International Plant\nNutrition Institute (IPNI), and the International Potash Institute (IPI) supported\nthe research from which most data in this paper were obtained and through which\nthe principles of SSNM that make this paper possible were developed.\nWe thank Ms. Nadialin Borje for the compilation of the data set and the\nQUEFTS analysis.

Several experimental evidences\nshowed that potassium balances in rice-based cropping systems are essentially\nnegative due to deficit application rates of the nutrient compared to its uptake.This\nhas lead to considerable K mining from soils that is undesirable for long term\nsustainability of rice-based systems. Potassium dynamics in soils are governed by\nthe mineralogy, while the K\u2013supplying capacity of the soils depends on the nature\nof the K-bearing minerals and the extent of weathering. Variability in type and\nstate of weathering of the K-bearing minerals as well as difference in management\nhistory leads to spatial difference in K fertility of soils. The current practice of\napplying potassium at a blanket dose without taking into account such variability\nis thus limiting crop yield and causing K mining as was evident from long-term\nexperiments. The concept of site-specific potassium management in rice-based\ncropping systems on the other hand provides an approach that takes into account\nthe K supplying capacity of soils and K requirement of crops while formulating\npotassium recommendations. Experimental evidences showed that such an\napproach can improve yield and economics of production of rice-based cropping\nsystems and can reverse the current negativeyield trends.\n\n\n\n**Keywords** potassium imbalance in Indian agriculture \ufffd soil mineralogy and\n\npotassium availability \ufffd site specific potassium management \ufffd rice based\ncropping systems\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nPotassium (K) did not receive much attention in India till the '80s because of the\ngeneral belief that the Indian soils were well supplied with potassium (Pasricha\n\n\nSK Sanyal\nBidhanChandra KrishiViswavidyalaya,Kalyani-741235,Nadia,WestBengal,India\ne-mail: sarojsanyal@yahoo.co.in\nMS Gill\nDirectorateof Extension,PunjabAgriculturalUniversity,Ludhiana-141004,India\nK Majumdar\nInternational Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), India Programme, 354, Sector 21, HUDA,\nGurgaon 122 016, Haryana,India, e-mail:kmajumdar@ipni.net\n\n\n388 389\n\n\nand Bansal 2001). However, the picture of crop responses to potassium in India\nhas been changing with time. Indeed, there is a growing evidence of increasing\ndeficiency of K as a result of imbalanced use of nitrogen (N) or N and phosphorus\n(P). Even under the so-called optimum rates of NPK application in long-term\nexperiments, the K balance under most of the soil-cropping systems was negative\n(Subba-Rao et al. 2001). Such imbalance in potassium application, however, has\nvariable impact on crop production due to the fact that K-supplying capacities of\nsoils vary based on mineralogy and dynamics of a particular soil type. So the\ncurrent practice of applying potassium at a blanket dose without taking into\naccount the soil concerned is either limiting crop yield and causing K mining\n(deficit K application) or wasting resource that are entirely imported (excess\napplication). Attaining Food Security had been a major challenge for the nation\nsince independence. The current stagnation in food grain production necessitates\nspecial initiatives to meet the increasing demands of food grains. Expansion of the\narea sown to rice, and crops grown in sequence to it, has ceased to be a major\nsource of increased output. Most of the targeted increase in production must now\nresult from greater yield per hectare.Appropriate nutrient management in general\nand potassium management in particular, will play a major role in overcoming\nstagnation in food grain production. Future strategies for potassium management\nneed to be more site-specific and dynamic based on a quantitative understanding\nof the congruence between nutrient supply and crop demand. The current paper\naims at analyzing the role of site-specific potassium management in improving\nproductivityof rice-basedcropping sequences.\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdscenario\ufffdin\ufffdIndia**\n\n\nPotassium (K) has long been a neglected nutrient in Indian agriculture.Analysis of\nthe fertilizer consumption scenario over the past decades shows that potash\ncontributed to less that 10% of the total nutrient consumption in the country.\nRemoval of K in proportion to N is very high in cropping systems, particularly\nthose involving cereal and fodder crops (Yadav et al. 1998) (Table 1). Potassium\nrequirements of crops are in general identical to N and 3-5 times higher than P.\nHowever, average K use in India over the last 30 years has been about one-seventh\nof N and about one-third of P.\n\nAn illustrative balance-sheet of NPK in Indian agriculture (Table 2) shows an\nannual depletion of K\ufffdO to the tune of 10.20 Mt and 5.97 Mt on gross and net basis, 2\nrespectively (Tandon 2004). Of the current net negative NPK balance or annual\ndepletion of 9.7 Mt, 19% is N, 12% Pand 69% K. Such alarming contribution of K\ntowards the negativebalanceof NPK is a major concern.\nConsequence of such imbalanced K application is evident in the information\nbased on analysis of more than 11 million soil samples that reflect the changing K\nfertility status of soils in different parts of the country (Hasan 2002). The\ndistribution of districts considered low, medium, and high in K fertility show that\n\n\n\n**Table\ufffd1** Nutrient\ufffduptake\ufffdin\ufffdimportant\ufffdcropping\ufffdsystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Crop sequence|Applied(kg ha- 1)|Col3|Col4|Total<br>yield<br>(t ha- 1)|Total uptake (kg ha- 1)|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Crop sequence|N|P O<br>2<br>5|K O<br>2|K O<br>2|N|P O<br>2<br>5|K O<br>2|\n|Maize-Wheat-Green gram<br>Rice-Wheat-Green gram<br>Maize-wheat<br>Rice-Wheat<br>Maize-Wheat<br>Pigeon pea-Wheat<br>P.

Intensification and\ndiversification are two main trends of rice-based cropping systems as they have\nevolved in different agro-ecological regions in India where wheat, maize or one of\nmany other secondary crops are grown during the part of the year when rice was\nnot in the field. Diversification and intensification of rice-based systems was\nadvocated to make a breakthrough in productivity and profitability, and several\noptions with different levels of productivity and profitability were outlined by\n(Gill 2006; Gill et al. 2008). The most prevalent cropping systems are rice\u2013rice,\nrice\u2013 rice\u2013rice, rice\u2013rice\u2013pulse, rice\u2013wheat, rice\u2013oilseed crop, and more recently\nrice\u2013maize. The rotation of rice-rice and rice-wheat, for example, are major\nagricultural production systems that account for 16 M ha of food grain producing\narea in India and are the mainstayof food security in the country.\nHowever, the rice sector has witnessed rapid dynamism in production\nprocesses. After a four-fold increase in production during the past four decades,\nthe production curves have started showing downward trend and productivity\ndecelerating since the later half of the 1990s. The productivity decline is\nexperienced not only in the core green revolution state of Punjab but also in several\nother states such as Tamilandu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, etc., including the\nrain-fed areas.There are several reasons for such stagnation, the most conspicuous\nbeing wide-scale nutrient depletion through crop harvest, on one hand and low\nlevelof replenishmentthrough inadequatenutrientsupply, on the other.\nTiwari et al. (2006) in their multi-location trial with rice-wheat system\nshowed that the average system uptake (rice + wheat) of nutrients over 10 sites\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nand 2 years was 761 kg of N + P\ufffdO + K\ufffdO ha year for an average system yield of 2 5 2\n\n\n-1\n\n13 t ha . The mean uptake of N: P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO was in the proportion of 100:29:129. 2 5 2\nSimilar experiments with rice-rice system across 6 sites and 2 years showed\n\n\n-1\n\naverage uptake of 782 kg of N +P\ufffdO + K\ufffdO for an average system yield of 12 t ha 2 5 2\nwith an average uptake ratio of 100:40:133 for N:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO. The mean K uptake 2 5 2\nwas 1.74 times the K input in case of rice-wheat system, while mean uptake was\n62% higher than K input in rice-rice system suggesting net depletion of soil K in all\nthe sites. The K-omission plots (no external K application) in this study showed\nthat native potassium supply in rice-wheat system varied from 205 to 354 kg K\ufffdO 2\nha year depending on location. In treatments based on K supply exclusively -1 -1\nfrom native sources (K-omission plots), the yield levels supported by sites differed\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nconsiderably. Thus, Ranchi with a native supply of 205 kg K\ufffdO ha year produced 2\n65% lesser system yield (rice-wheat) than did Ludhiana which provided 354 kg\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nK\ufffdO ha year in absence of external supply (Tiwari et al., 2006). Similar results 2\nwere obtained in rice-rice cropping system by the authors. This suggests that sitespecific potassium application, based on estimation of soil supply and crop\nrequirement, will be required to support equal levels of yields in rice-based\ncropping systems in different locations.\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Mineralogyand K availability**\n\n\nPotassium availability to plants is regulated in soils by the soluble, exchangeable\nand non-exchangeable fractions of K that are interrelated by a dynamic\nequilibrium. The driving force for this equilibrium is largely a function of clay\ncomposition, while the magnitude of the process is a function of clay content of\nsoil. As growing season is limited in most cases, a high growth rate for high yield\ncan only be maintained with high flux rates of nutrients to the plant roots.\nTherefore, mineralogy plays a pivotal role in potassium supplying capacity of a\nparticular soil (Rao and Rao 1996). The mineral sources of K in soils are the\ndioctahedral micas: muscovite, glauconite, and hydrous mica or illite; the\ntrioctahedral mica, namely biotite and phlogopite and the feldspar, namely\nsanidine, orthoclase and microlone (Sarma 1976). Weathering of micas / feldspars\nleads to the formation of secondary minerals (such as smectiteor vermiculites), _via_\nintermediates like illites, with simultaneous release of K (Sparks and Huang\n1985). Results of numerous studies (Sanyal et al. 2009) suggest that for soils of\nlow intensity of weathering and from trioctahedral mica parent material, K release\nto soil solution is rather high as for the crop need and the replenishment of the\nexhausted K in soil due to crop removal. For soils of dioctahedral mica parent\nmaterial, and a moderate state of weathering or both, K release is less, but it is the\nleast for soils of low mica content or intensive weathering, or both. Indeed, while\nformulating a sound K fertilizer recommendation, it is imperative that the above\ncharacteristicsneed to be taken into account.\n\nPlant uptake of K is related to the weathering of feldspars and micas in soil\nenvironments. Micas are more important than K-feldspars in supplying K to plants\n(Rich 1972). The native K status depends, not only on the parent material of soil,\nbut also on the subsequent stages of weathering of the parent material. So the\nweathering history of a mineral phase, rather than its mere presence, may be an\nimportant factor to be reckoned while relating the plant availability of soil K to the\nsoil mineralogy (Sanyal and Majumdar 2001). An example of such postulate is\nprovided by a sharp contrast between the Entisol and the Alfisol under rice-based\ncropping sequence inWest Bengal (Table 3) where despite having almost the same\namount of illite content, there was a wide variation in total K and nonexchangeable\nK (NEK) contents of these soils (Sanyal et al. 2009). This obviously is linked to\nthe relative stages of weathering of the illitic mineral phase in the given soils\n(Sanyal et al. 2009; Ghosh and Sanyal 2006). Such observations have important\nbearing to the fertilizer K recommendations to support the different cropping\n\nsequences.\nRecently, Chatterjee (2008) found wide variability in soil K fractions in\nselected rice growing soils in the alluvial tract of West Bengal. Descriptive\nstatistics of K fractions in soils of three adjacent blocks of Nadia district showed\nwide variability (Table 4).

The long-term experiments also\nrevealed that response to applied potassium increased steadily over the last 20\nyears as a result of depletion of soil K (Swarup and Srinivasa Rao 1999). Singh et\n\n\n\n394 395\n\n\nal. (2002) in a 8 year rice-wheat cropping system experiment observed that\napplication of K at 33 kg ha to both the crops caused a negative potassium balance -1\nof 103 to 156 kg ha year -1 -1 depending on the rate of N application. Such changes in\nK fertility under intensive cropping, however, can also be quite abrupt,\nparticularly when vegetables are included in the rice-based system. Sen et al.\n(2008), while assessing changes in nutrient availability through GIS-based\nfertility mapping, found that K fertility in an intensively cultivated village in the\nalluvial zone ofWest Bengal decreased perceptibly within two years. For available\n\n\n-1 -1\n\nK\ufffdO, the range changed from 87-448 kg ha in 2006 to 56-375 kg ha in 2008 2\nand the mean from 166 kg ha in 2006 to 88 kg ha in 2008. Potassium fertility of -1 -1\nthe village was generally low to medium in 2006 but the frequency distribution\nshifted more towards the low fertility category with a substantial increase in\nsample number in the lowest category (Figure 1). The authors found that lower\napplication of potassium during this period due to unavailability and high uptake\nof K by the vegetable crops contributed to this swift decline in K fertility of the\nsoils.\n\nConsequence of such depletion scenario across the country has led to negative\npotassium balance in most cropping systems, including rice-based systems. Ladha\net al. (2003) analyzed yield trends in rice-wheat systems in the IGP, non-IGPareas\nof India and China and noted that rice and wheat yields stagnated at 72 and 85% of\nlong-term experiments where recommended rates of NPK were applied.

Site specific nutrient management (SSNM) provides an approach\nof nutrient management that takes into account 1) nutrient requirement for unit\nyield, 2) nutrient contribution from soils, and 3) nutrient contributions required\nfrom fertilizers to formulate fertilizer recommendation. Nutrient use on the\n\nprinciples of SSNM could provide an avenue to reverse the declining productivity\ntrend and nutrientminingfrom soils.\nUndoubtedly, rice based cereal cropping systems are very exhaustive and\nrequire high quantum of macro, secondary and micronutrients. They are practiced\nin a myriad of soil conditions in IGP and non-IGP areas. Variability in nutrient\nreserves, nutrient supplying capacity of the soils under these vastly different soil\nand climatic conditions and management strategies require that potassium is\napplied in a site-specific manner to improve productivity and maintain soil\nfertility.\nIt is well established that crop yields, profit, plant nutrient uptake and nutrient\nuse efficiencies can be significantly increased by applying fertilizers on a field\nspecific and crop season specific manner (Bijay-Singh et al. 2003). Fertilizer\nK rates predicted by the QUEFTS model (Janssen et al. 1990) to achieve high\nyield and maintain soil fertility are usually higher than the rates currently\napplied by farmers. Potassium rates in SSNM plots ranged from 50 to 66 kg ha -1\ncrop while the average farmer fertilizer K rate was 30 kg ha (Bijay-Singh et al. -1 -1\n2003).\nThe findings from a survey conducted by the Project Directorate for Cropping\nSystems Research (ICAR), India on the use pattern of nutrients to rice-wheat\nsystem in various sub-regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plains are presented inTable 7.\nThe economic, social and climatic factors as well as soil and institutional factors\nwere largely responsible for spatial variation in major nutrients application. The\nmost conspicuous point to note was the use of potassium in a much imbalanced\nmanner in both the crops that seems to be the prime factor causing yield stagnation\nof rice-wheatsystem in IGP.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\nauthors further reported that fertilizer K rates used were not sufficient to sustain a\nneutral K input-output balance in 90% of the long-term experiments, while all the\nexperiments with significant yield decline had large negative K balances. It is clear\nthat such negative K balances in soils will adversely affect the sustainability of\nrice-based systems and a rational approach of K management, keeping in mind the\nvariable soil supplying power and nutrient requirements of crops/cropping\nsystems, will be necessary to reverse the trend.\n\n\n**Site-specificpotassium management**\n\n\n\n2\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 397\n\n\n**Table\ufffd7** Major\ufffdnutrients\ufffduse\ufffdin\ufffdvarious\ufffdsub\ufffdregions\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdIndo-Gangetic\ufffdPlains\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n|Sub region of IGP|Area<br>(X 103<br>ha)|Nutrient use (kg ha- 1)|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Sub region of IGP|Area<br>(X 10<br>ha)<br>3|N|N|P|P|K|K|\n|Sub region of IGP|Area<br>(X 10<br>ha)<br>3|Rice|Wheat|Rice|Wheat|Rice|Wheat|\n|Trans-Gangetic Plains<br>Upper-Gangetic Plains<br>Mid-Gangetic Plains<br>Lower-Gangetic Plains|3809<br>3160<br>3133<br>119|166.1<br>115.0<br>116.1<br>82.6|154.2<br>109.8<br>100.0<br>87.1|51.3<br> 40.7<br> 29.1<br> 16.3|49.6<br>37.6<br>32.7<br>21.4|0.8<br>5.2<br>4.3<br> 36.4|12.3<br>11.4<br>20.5<br>44.0|\n\n\nAdapted\ufffdfrom\ufffdSharma\ufffd(2003)\ufffdafter\ufffdmodification\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\nRecent work on site-specific potassium management (SSKM) by Chatterjee\nand Sanyal (2007) across three locations and twelve sites in the alluvial soils of\nWest Bengal showed significant yield increase in the SSKM plot over the general\nrecommendation.

Gill et al.\n(2009) studied the level of response of NPK in major cropping systems across 32\ncenters located in different agro-climatic zones.

The SSNM requires intensive soil sampling and analyses in\norder to construct crop- and soil-specific nutrient recommendation. This provides\na major challenge considering the fragmented land holdings in the country as well\nas the existing soil testing infrastructure. Geo-statistical analysis and GIS-based\nmapping effectively counters that challenge by providing an option to create soil\nfertility maps of large areas through interpolation of soil analysis data from a small\nnumber of samples (Sen et al. 2008). Such dynamic maps provide an opportunity\nto assess variability in distribution of native nutrients across a large area and thus\naid in strategizing appropriate management of nutrients leading to better yield and\nenvironmental protection. Indeed, in India, where each farm family operates one\nor several small field plots, farmers' fertilizer decision making process is\ncommonly limited by inadequate understanding of soil nutrient status or spatial\nnutrient variability of their plots, with such understanding on spatial variability of\nsoil nutrients in fragmented land-holdings being expected to give a strong impact\non the sustainable development of agriculture in the country.As mentioned earlier,\nSanyal and Chatterjee (2007) revealed that contrast of non-exchangeable\npotassium and available potassium status between soils can be effectively utilized\nto modify the soil test-based fertilizer recommendation practices for potassium.\nSen and Majumdar (2006) and Sen et al. (2008) documented wide spatial\nvariability in available nutrient contents of soils even in small areas of intensively\ncultivated region of West Bengal. Such studies clearly highlighted the necessity to\ncomprehensively understand the spatial variability of soil nutrients under the\nprevalent small-scale operation systems in India for developing the guidelines for\nsoil nutrient management and fertilization for optimum production (Sen et al.\n2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Fig. 2**\n\n\n\nInterrelation between grain yield and uptake of potassium in rice (IET\n1444)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Mukhopadhyay et al. 2008\n\n\n\nPotassium based nutrient management tested at cultivators' field under theAll\nIndia Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Cropping System (2006-07) had\nhighlighted the response of potassium and sulphur in rice-wheat system. The\naverage nutrient management options under the existing farmers' crop\nmanagement practice (FCM) gave 4.32 to 6.95 t ha paddy yield, which improved -1\nby 3 to 25% with recommended management practice at different locations.\nInclusion of K, S and Zn, along with farmers' management, produced extra yield of\n0.75 to 1.78 t ha -1 depending on locations. The corresponding response to\npotassium over N P clearly demonstrated the major role of potassium towards\nenhancement in yield (Table 10). Wheat productivity increased from 0.13 to 0.68 t\nha -1 over farmers' fertilizer management practice (FFP), along with the\ncorresponding response to potassium application being 0.13 to 0.68 t ha over NP, -1\nthereby stressing the fact that yield and response to potassium are variable and K\nmust be applied in a site-specific manner to improve productivity of rice based\nsystems.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Spatial variabilityand GIS mapping:Akey to future**\n\n\nThus, the question that arises now is where one goes from such concepts like\ntargeted yield, soil test recommendation, and SSNM for efficient and balanced use\n\n\n\n400 401\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nLarger proportion of mining in respect of potassium as mentioned in previous\nsections partly result from the average crop removal of 1.5 times more K than that\nof N and lower K application than N or P, with the misconception that the soils of\nthe country are relatively rich in potash. Apart from this, relatively low cost per\nunit of nitrogen, its widespread availability, and quick and evident response of the\nplant has further accentuated such an imbalance. While it will be necessary to\nrationalize the use of N fertilizers, ominous signs are that if strategies and policies\nare not developed to boost K supplies, and this essential nutrient continues to\nremain neglected as in the past, future sustainability of rice-based systems is likely\nto be constrained mostly by K. Sustainability of the regions supporting high\nintensity cropping and fertilizer responsive strains are foreseen to be the earliest\nvictims of such imbalance. Besides, our current understanding and interest on soil\nquality requires that enough focus is given towards the mining aspects of nutrients\nin general and potash in particular.As much as it may seem economically prudent\nto apply less potassium from external sources as it is an imported commodity, and\nrely more on the inherent potash supplying capacity of the soils, in the long-run it\nmight turn out to be a very short-sighted approach as we lose the quality of a very\nvital resource of our country, our SOILS. Rather a balanced approach that takes\ninto account soil properties, its potassium supplying capacity and potassium\nrequirement of crops in the realm of site-specific nutrient management can reverse\nthe declining production trend, improve the soil quality and thus will leave our\nenvironmentcleanfor the posterity.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAnnual Report (2006-07) All India Coordinated Research Project on Cropping\nSystem Research.

In this\nstudy, Ershilipu village of Xinzhou city in Shanxi Province, which encompassed\n245 ha and consisted of 443 farmer's plots, was selected as experimental sites to\ndevelop the approach to meet the needs of site-specific nutrient management for\nthe small scale operation under family responsibility system in China. Two\nhundred and eighty plow layer (0-20 cm) soil samples were collected on a 100\n\u00d7100 m grid prior to the plots being sown for maize. Soil pH, organic matter (OM),\navailable P, K, Zn, and other nutrients were measured. The results showed that\nOM, P, Zn and Fe were the main limiting factors in the soil. Spatial variability of\ntested soil properties in the experimental village was observed. Great variation\nwas observed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B, and small spatial variation in soil K\nresulting from the little fertilizer input. The spatial variability of soil OM and Ca\nrelied mainly on regional factors. The variability of soil nutrient was greatly\nrelated to fertilization history, fertilizer application level, and soil texture. Sitespecific nutrient management (SSNM) based on regionalized balanced\nfertilization helped to produce higher yield and income due to rational nutrient\nsupply to crop.\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\nSSNM GIS \ufffd \ufffd Soil nutrients Spatialvariability \ufffd\n\n\n\n**Abbreviations** DGPS: differential global positioning system; OM: organic\n\nmatter;SSNM: site specificnutrientmanagement\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\n\nSoil nutrient management with information technology is an important part of\ninformation agriculture (Atherton et al. 1999; Borgre and Mallarino 1997; Bouma\n\n\nPing He Jiyun Jin\nBeijingOffice of the InternationalPlant Nutrition Institute,Beijing100081 China\ne-mail:phe@ipni.net\nHongtingWang\nInstitute of Soil and Fertilizer, ShanxiAcademy ofAgricultural Sciences, Taiyuan\n030031 China\n\n\n406 407\n\n\net al. 1999). Compared with developed countries, China is far behind in terms of\ninformation technology use in soil nutrient management (Jin and Jiang 2000). The\nsmall scale farmer's farmland and variability in their fertilization practices caused\nthe great variability in soil nutrient status. A fertilizer application survey\ninvestigation in Shanxi province indicated that the percentage of time that N\napplication rate exceeded 250 kg N ha was 20 percent for wheat and 25 percent \u20131\nfor maize, and the percentage of time that N application rate less than 150 kg N ha \u20131\naccounted for 56 percent for wheat and 53 percent for maize (Yang et al. 2008).\nContinuous cropping without balanced and efficient use of fertilizers has\ncontributed to not only losses in yield and profit, but also to environmental\nproblems such as groundwater nitrate-N contamination and eutrophication of\nrivers. Therefore, how to manage soil nutrient for the small scale operation with\ninformationtechnologyis of great challengein managingsoil nutrient.\nIn China, due to the small-scale farm size and the cost of soil testing, it is\nimpossible to give fertilizer recommend fertilizer based on each farmer. Usually,\nthe same amount of fertilizer is recommended for a 15- to 20 ha field irrespective\nof the soil nutrient variability within the field. Thus, some areas of a field will\nreceive too much fertilizer, whereas other areas will receive too little. A better\nunderstanding of the spatial variability of soil nutrients is required as a basis of soil\nnutrient management and rational fertilizer application (Hammond 1994; Franzen\net al. 1996). Site-specific nutrient management in developed countries is based on\na large scale of farm size with a high level of mechanization. With the rapid\nprogresses of rural development and thereafter movement of farmers working in\nthe city, and the policy on stimulation of the farm land transition to the larger size,\nfertilizer precision management based on soil nutrient variability would inevitably\nmake great progress.\nIn this study, a systematic analysis of soil nutrient variability in a maize\nproduction area associated with the application of corresponding management\napproach was carried out. The objectives were 1) to investigate spatial variation of\nsoil nutrient status and its distribution; 2) to develop nutrient management strategy\nbased on nutrient variation; and 3) to evaluate the effect of nutrient management\non yieldand profits.\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\n\u20131\n\n\n\nSoil sampling and analysis\n\n\nAtotal of 280 soil samples from 0-20 cm depth were collected on a 100\u00d7100 m grid\nin the study areas of guided by using differential global positioning system\n(DGPS) technology with a trimble 132 GPS receiver. All soil samples were airdried and ground through 2 mm sieve prior to analysis. The soil nutrients were\ndetermined with procedures applied by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural\nSciences (CAAS) and International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) Cooperative\nSoil and Plant Analysis Laboratory and the National Laboratory of Soil Testing\nand Fertilizer Recommendation of CAAS as described by Portch and Hunter\n(2002).Available P, K, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn of the soil samples were extracted using\n0.25 M/LNaHCO\ufffd, 0.01 M/LEDTAand 0.01 M/LNH\ufffdF.The concentration of Pin 3 4\nthe extraction was measured by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method.\nConcentration of K, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were determined using an atomic\nabsorption spectrophotometer. The organic matter (OM) of the soil samples was\nextracted with an extracting solution containing 0.2 M/L NaOH, 0.01 M/L EDTA\nand 2 percent methyl alcohol, and the concentration of OM in the extract was\ndetermined by colormetry method. Soil pH was measured in a 2.5:1 soil-water\nsuspension using a glass pH electrode. Soil nitrate-N was extracted with a 2 M/L\nKCl solution, and the concentration of nitrate-N in the extract was analyzed using\nan ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 220 and 275 nm (Chen et al. 1995; Wang et al.\n2004).\n\n\nData analysis\n\n\nDescriptivestatisticsand geo-statisticswere used to analyzethe data.ANOVAwas\ncalculated using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The structure of spatial variation was\nanalyzed through semivariograms using GS+ for Windows 3.1. Spatial\ndistribution was analyzed through kriging interpolation using ArcGIS 8.0\nsoftware.\n\nA semivariogram from the set of sample data is calculated using the\nfollowing equation(Chil s and Delfiner 1999):\n\n\n`\uff0d` 2\n_\u03b3(h)_ =[1/2 _N(h)_ ] [ ( _Z x+h_ _i_ ) Z( )] _x_ _i_ `(\ufffd)1`\n\n\n\n**Materialsand methods**\n\n\nLocationof trials\n\n\nThe trials were located at Ershilipu village, Boming town, Xinzhou city, Shanxi\nprovine. The tested soil was Fluvo-aquic. The site consisted of 443 farmers (244\nha), with an east longitude of 112\u00b017' to 112\u00b058' and a north latitude of 38\u00b013' to\n38\u00b041'. The local climate is semiarid monsoon, with an average annual rainfall of\n405 mm, averagetemperatureof 8.5 C, and a frost free period about 160 days. 0\n\n\n\nWhere _\u03b3(h)_ is the semi-variance for separate distance class h, _N(h)_ is the\n\nnumber of sample pairs at each distance interval, ( ) is the value of the variable _h Z x_ _i_\n\n_Z_ at sampled location _x_ _i_ and ( _Z x+h_ _i_ ) is the value of the variable _Z_ at a distance _h_\n\naway from . _x_ _i_\nParameters defining semivariogram models are nugget (variability at a\nsmaller scale than the sampling internal and/or sampling and analytical error), sill\n\n\n\nWhere _\u03b3(h)_ is the semi-variance for separate distance class h, _N(h)_ is the\n\nnumber of sample pairs at each distance interval, ( ) is the value of the variable _h Z x_ _i_\n\n_Z_ at sampled location _x_ _i_ and ( _Z x+h_ _i_ ) is the value of the variable _Z_ at a distance _h_\n\n_x_\n\n\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n_i_\n\n\n\n_i_ _i_\n\n\n\n_i_\n\n\n\n408 409\n\n\nand range.

The sill expresses the distance (range) beyond which i\nsamples are not correlated.\nKriging of geo-statistics is an optimum interpolation technique for marking\nunbiased estimates of regionalized variables at unsampled locations in which the\nstructural properties of the semivariogram and the values of a soil variable _Z_ at an\nunsampledpoint X is estimatedby the formula (Chil s and Delfiner 1999): 0\n\n\n\n**Table 1** Soil OM, available nutrient and pH in the maize production area under\nstudy\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n_Z_\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n_n_\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n# \ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n# ( X 0 ) \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd i Z ( X i )\n\n_i_ \ufffd1\n\n\n\n\n# Z ( X 0 ) \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd i Z ( X i\n\n_i_ \ufffd1\n\n\n\n`\uff08\ufffd\uff09` 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere X denotes the set of spatial coordinates (X\ufffd, X\ufffd), 1 2 _n_ is the number of\nneighboring samples and `\u03bbi` are the weights associated with the sampling points\nXi.

Table 1 showed that most of the soils were low in soil\nOM, and deficient P, Zn and Fe, with the percentage of soil samples below the\ncritical value being 100, 86, 94 and 77, respectively. About 23percent of the soils\nwere relatively low in K, whereas soil S, Mn and Cu contents were above medium\nevaluation levels, with average values of 44.6 mg l, 6.1 mg l and 1.4 mg l, -1 -1 -1\nrespectively. Soil Ca, Mg and B contents were much higher than the critical values.\nGreat variation existed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B content with C.V. of 47.5percent,\n46.0percent,38.5percent,37.6percentand 42.0percent,respectively(Table 1).\n\n\nSpatialvariationof soil nutrients\n\n\nSemi-variograms analysis revealed a distinct different degree of spatial variability\nof soil nutrients. Cambardella et al.

About 20percent and\n23percent of the spatial variability for OM and Ca were due to random factors\nassociated with human activities (such as fertilization, crop varieties, management\nlevels, etc), which demonstrated that spatial variability for soil OM and Ca was\nmainly relied on regional factors (e.g. topography, climate and soil matrix).

The contour map of soil properties may directly reflect the spatial\ndistribution characteristic of diversified soil nutrient element; also help to\nunderstand the nutrient status to provide the foundation to rational fertilization.\nThe integrated map was conducted with overlaying the nutrient contour map and\nfarmer's plot map to understand soil nutrient status of each farmer's plot. If soil\nnutrient contents in most areas of a farmer's plot were within one evaluation class,\n\n\n**Fig.\ufffd2** Semivariograms\ufffdfor\ufffdsoil\ufffdpH,\ufffdOM,\ufffdP,\ufffdK\ufffdand\ufffdZn\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdstudy\ufffdarea\n\n\n\nsoil nutrient contents for all area of that farmer's plot were considered to fall within\none evaluation class. This made it possible to improve the fertilizer\nrecommendation system from one recommendation from 15-20 ha field to a sitespecificnutrientmanagementfor a specificfarmer's plot.\nThe distribution area with high P and K contents which was over the critical\nlevel was located in the middle of the eastern part of the village, and that with\nmedium P and K nutrient level was distributed in the western part of the village.\nThe distribution area with lowest P and K contents was located at the south and\n\nnorth bottom of the village. Soil Zn distribution map was similar to soil P (Fig. 3).\nIt was indicated that great spatial variation existed in soil nutrients, and spatial\ndistributionsimilaritywas observed in the soil P, K and Zn.\n\n\nYield and profit evaluationof SSNM\n\n\nThe site specific fertilizer recommendation (SSNM) significantly increased corn\nyield and farmer's income compared to farmer's conventional practice. The\naverage yield of spring maize increased by 12.4percent and average farmer's\nincome increased by 798 Yuan/ha (117US$/ha) from SSNM fertilizer\nrecommendation compared to farmer's conventional practice in the experimental\nsite. These results showed that site-specific soil nutrient management based on\nfarmer's field unit can help to produce higher yield and income due to rational\nnutrientsupply to crop.\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nPrevious and the current study indicated that great variation existed in soil nutrient\ndue to the small scale farm size production, different cropping system and\ndifferent fertilization custom (Yang et al; 2000; Huang et al., 2003, 2006). The\nresult obtained in the current study indicated that great variation for soil OM, P,\nand Zn existed in the study area, and the survey of crop production history and\nfertilizer application indicated that a close relationship existed between the spatial\nvariability of the soil nutrients and the crop production history and fertilizer\napplication rates. For example, the higher contents of soil P, K and Zn at mid\neastern of the village were resulted from the corresponding vegetable production\nwith heavy inorganic and organic nutrient input. The medium nutrient levels for P\nand K were located at the western part, where was the maize production area with\ncertain nutrient input less than those from vegetable production area. The reasons\nfor lower contents of Pand K located at south and north bottom parts were the soils\nwith sandy loamtextureand relativelylow nutrientinputs from farmers.\nThe site-specific nutrient management practices have been carried out based\non the variation of soil nutrients. For the areas with great nutrient spatial variation,\nthe fertilizer recommendation would regionalize the study area with variable\n\n\n\n412 413\n\n\n**Fig. 3** Distributionof soil P, K and Zn in the experimentalsite\n\n\n\nfertilizer application rate; while for the areas with small nutrient spatial variation,\nan uniformed fertilization rate would be recommended.Yang et al. (2000) reported\nthat the application of grid sampling and variable rate application technology in a\n54-ha cotton field increased fertilizer efficiency, with a net profit of 5313 RMB\nYuan ha -1 (RMB Yuan 8.26 = US$ 1) higher than that obtained with local\nfertilization practice. Huang et al. (2003) reported that the incorporation of\nregionalized balanced fertilization technology into wheat and corn farming\npractices significantly increased income by 590-1350 RMB Yuan ha . The results -1\nobtained in this study demonstrated that maize yield increased by 12.4percent and\nprofit increased by RMBYuan 798 ha with the regionalized balanced fertilization -1\ncompared with that by farmer's practice. It was indicated that site specific nutrient\nmanagement practice based on nutrient spatial variation with regionalized\nbalancedfertilizationis a promising nutrientmanagementpracticein China.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\nThe great variability in farmer's fertilization practices resulted in the great spatial\nvariation in soil nutrient status in the study area. The soil OM, P, Zn and Fe was\ndeficient in high percentage of nutrient values below the critical values. Large\nvariation in nutrient contents was observed in soil OM, P, S, Zn and B. On the\ncontrary, soil K had a smaller spatial variability due to little nutrient input as\nfertilizer. The variability of soil OM and Ca attributed mainly to random factors\nand regional factors (e.g. topography, climate and soil matrix), and that for pH and\nother nutrients related to more closely to random factors related to human\nactivities such as fertilization, cropping system, etc. The contour map of soil\nproperties may directly reflect the spatial distribution characteristic of diversified\nsoil nutrient, and help to understand the nutrient status to provide the foundation to\nrational fertilization; Site-specific nutrient management integrated with\nregionalized balanced fertilization based on farmer's field plot can help to produce\nhigher yieldand incomedue to rationalnutrientsupply to crop.\n\n\n**Acknowledgement** This\ufffdresearch\ufffdwas\ufffdsupported\ufffdby\ufffdthe\ufffdNational\ufffdBasic\ufffdResearch\n\nProgram\ufffdof\ufffdChina\ufffd(973\ufffdProgram)\ufffd(2007CB109306),\ufffdInternational\ufffdPlant\nNutrition\ufffdInstitute\ufffdand\ufffdShanxi Academy\ufffdof Agricultural\ufffdSciences.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAtherton BC, Morgan MT, Shearere SA, Stombawgh TS, Ward AD (1999) Sitespecific farming: A perspective on information needs, benefits, and\nlimitations.J SoilWater Conserv 54:455\u2013461\n\nBorges R, Mallarino AP (1997) Field-scale variability of phosphorus and\npotassium uptake by no-tillcorn and soybean.

Production and productivity of major crops in the state are lower\nthan national average probably due to imbalance and lower fertilizer consumption\nrate (62 kg ha ). Potassium application in the state was neglected up to 80's due to -1\nlack of response and thereafter crop responses are increasing in time and space.\nLow application of K leads to depletion of K to the extent of 242.8 thousand tones\nper annum. In long-term fertilizer studies with rice-rice and rice-pulse cropping\nsystems, the sustainability of crop yield was threatened in absence of K\napplication. In many production systems in the state, the non-exchangeable K\nmeets the K requirement and sustains the level of production. Higher correlation\nbetween HNO\ufffd-K and K balance and yield suggests the inclusion of this method in 3\nsoil testing programmes in the state. Optimal and super-optimal doses of K could\nnot sustain the yield and K depletion. Hence, a need to reschedule the K dose for\ncrops. An holistic management of K could be possible by applying adequate\namount of K on the basis of soil test, recycling of crop residues and addition of\nrural and non-toxic urban compost in different cropping systems under varying\nagro-ecological regions.

The production and\nproductivity of major crops in the state are below the Indian average. In addition to\nsoil acidity, low fertilizer consumption (57 kg ha ) and imbalanced use of fertilizer -1\nare the reasons for low productivity. Although the state has experienced upward\ntrend in fertilizer use from 7.6 kg ha (1980) to 62 kg ha (2008 \u2013 09), the ratio of N -1 -1\nto K fertilizer is still wide, although narrowed down from 5.9 during 1980 to 4.43\nduring 2008\u201309.\nDuring 1960 to 1990, India experienced a dramatic change in food grain\nproduction with introduction of high yielding varieties and improved management\nstrategies. Later on, the yield level remains stagnant or declined even with increase\nin level of input. Evidence of declining partial or total factor productivity is\nalready available. Depletion of soil K was one of the reason of yield decline in long \ufffd\nterm fertilizerexperiment(Ladha et al. 2003).\nThe experience with rice \u2013 rice cropping system which started during 1972 \u2013\n73 in lateritic (Aric haplaquepts) soil of Bhubaneswar showed lack of response to\nK till 1983 and thereafter the response increased from 2.90 q ha to 8.95 q ha . In -1 -1\nmost of the cropping systems practiced in India, K balance is negative, however\nthe negative balance is not reflected in available K (Water soluble + Exchangeable\nK) status over years of cropping.Ahuge negative balance of 242.8 thousand tones\nper year in Orissa (Mishra and Mitra 2001) and proposed deficit of 8.1 million\ntones per year by 2020 (Katyal 2001) in Indian agriculture is a matter of concern.\nWe have attempted to discuss K dynamics and management practices for major\ncropping systems of Orissa under diverse agro-ecologicalsituations.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n|05)|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Crops|Productivity (q ha )<br>-1|Productivity (q ha )<br>-1|\n|Crops|Orissa|All India|\n|Rice<br>Wheat<br>Maize<br>Arhar<br>Groundnut<br>Sugarcane<br>Potato|14.5<br>13.3<br>13.2<br>6.8<br>15.1<br>686.0<br>94.9|19.8<br>26.0<br>19.0<br>6.6<br>10.2<br>647.5<br>179.2|\n\n\n**Soils of Orissa**\n\n\n\n0 / 0 /\n\n\n\nThe state of Orissa is situated between 17 47 and 22\ufffd33 N latitude and between\n81\ufffd21' and 87\ufffd30 E longitude.

They are rich in Fe,Al oxides and\n\n\n\nmore strongly weathered that Inceptisols. Entisols (10% TGA) represent alluvial,\ncoastal saline and colluvial soil. These soils are recently formed soil with little\ndevelopment of pedogenic horizons and are seen in flood plains in delta areas.\nVertisols (6% TGA) are black or regur and occurs in specific locations of the state.\nThese soils are black or dark coloured, uniform with gilgai micro relief. The clay\ncontent is more than 30% and clay minerals are mostly smectitic.These soils swell\non wetting and shrink on drying with cracks of more than 1 cm wide and have\nangular blocky structure. About 70-75% of soils of Orissa are acidic and support\nimportant production systems including cereals, pulses, oilseeds, horticultural\ncrops, plantation crops and forestry. The production and productivity of crops in\nOrissa are low (Table 1) as compared to all India average due to both deficiency\nand toxicity of plant nutrients, low consumption of fertilizer and imbalanced use\nof fertilizer(Table 2).\n\n\n**Table 1** Productivity of different crops in Orissa as compared to all India (2004\n\nSource: Agricultural\ufffdStatistics\ufffdof\ufffdOrissa\ufffd2008\n\n\n**Table\ufffd2** Fertilizer\ufffdconsumption\ufffdrate\ufffdand\ufffdratio\ufffdof\ufffdN\ufffdand\ufffdK\ufffdin\ufffdOrissa\n\n|Year|N+P O + K O (kg ha -1)<br>2 5 2|N: K O ratio<br>2|\n|---|---|---|\n|1980<br>1990<br>2000<br>2005-06<br>2006-07<br>2007-08|7.6<br>21.0<br>31.0<br>46.0<br>52.0<br>57.0|5.9<br>5.1<br>6.7<br>5.8<br>4.9<br>4.4|\n\n\n\nSource: Agricultural\ufffdStatistics\ufffdof\ufffdOrissa\ufffd2008\n\n\n**Mineralogy\ufffdof\ufffdsoils**\n\n\nImportant K bearing minerals in soils of Orissa are muscovite, biotite and feldspar.\nRelease of K to crops depends on the nature of dominating K bearing mineral. On\n\n\n\n0 / 0 /\n\n\n\n418 419\n\n\nthe basis of K release power, the minerals are arranged in the order of: biotite >\nmuscovite > orthoclase > microcline. The inherent status of K in soils of Orissa is\n\nmainly governed by the soil mineralogy. The microcline is the most common Kfeldspar in the soils of Orissa (Sahu et al. 1995). InAlfisols, orthoclase constituted\n9.8 to 41.1% while muscovite mica from nil to 6.1% (Table 3). The presence of\nhigh content of light minerals (orthoclase feldspar) in fine sand fractions may be\nattributed to moderate weathering in the environment. High temperature with\nalternate wet and dry season in humid sub-tropical climate of Orissa are also\nconducive for development of illite in the clay fractions due to alternation and\npartial hydrolysis of feldspar and mica (Sahu et al. 1983). The occurrence of\nKaolinite in these soils is also expected due to leaching of bases. In the Inceptisols,\n\n\n**Table\ufffd3** Mineral\ufffdcomposition\ufffdof\ufffddifferent\ufffdsoil\ufffdorders\ufffdof\ufffdOrissa\n\n|Location|Classification|Orthoclase<br>(%)|Mica<br>Muscovite<br>(%)|Clay<br>mineralogy<br>in order of<br>abundance|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Alfisols|Alfisols|Alfisols|Alfisols|Alfisols|\n|Phulbani<br>Bhubaneswar<br>Khurda<br>Semiliguda<br>Suakati<br>Muktapur|Oxic Paleustalfs<br>Rhodic Paleustalfs<br>Ferric Plinthustalfs<br>Oxic Paleustalfs<br>Ultic Paleustalfs<br>Lithic Plinthustalfs|24.6<br>41.1<br>37.6<br>9.8<br>31.0<br>15.4|6.1<br>-<br>-<br>1.9<br>-<br>-|I,K<br>I,K<br>I,K<br>K,I<br>K,I<br>I,K|\n|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|Inceptisols|\n|Bhubaneswar<br>Shymakhunta<br>Ranital<br>Motto<br>Keshpur|Eutrochrepts<br>Aeric Ustochrepts<br>Typic Haplaquepts<br>Vertic Haplaquepts<br>Typic Haplaquepts|16.0<br>30.5<br>7.0<br>41.5<br>42.5|1.0<br>-<br>2.5<br>-<br>4.8|I,M,K<br>K,I,M<br>M,I,K<br>K,I,M<br>M,C,I,K|\n|Entisols|Entisols|Entisols|Entisols|Entisols|\n|Jasuapur<br>Kendrapara<br>Chilika<br>Astaranga|Typic Ustifluvents<br>Typic Usterthents<br>Prammaquents<br>Typic Haplaquents|27.1<br>33.0<br>22.5<br>38.6|14.8<br>1.1<br>3.1<br>4.3|I,M,K<br>I,M,K<br>K,I,M<br>M,I,K|\n|Vertisols|Vertisols|Vertisols|Vertisols|Vertisols|\n|Bhawanipatwana<br>(Arkabali)<br>Luisinga|Ustalfic Pellusterts<br>Typic Pellusterts|26.9<br>12.4|11.0<br>2.7|I,M<br>M,I|\n\n\n\nI\ufffd=\ufffdIllite,\ufffdK=\ufffdKaolinite,\ufffdM=\ufffdMontmorillonite,C=Chlorite\nSource\ufffd:\ufffdSahu\ufffdet\ufffdal.\ufffd1995\n\n\n\northoclase content varies 7 to 42.4 %. Except Shyamakhunta and Motto (saline\nsoil), mica content varies between 1.0 to 4.8 %. These soils in general are, neutral\nto slightly alkaline and have high base saturation capacity with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+\ndominating in the exchange complex. These conditions are favorable for the\nformation of smectites in the clay fractions (Sahu et al. 1983). Alternation of Kfeldspar might have led to the formation of illite in clays. The Entisols are found in\nDelta area of Orissa due to deposition of silt and clay by the action of flood and\ncontained higher amount of orthoclase (27.1 to 38.6%) and mica (1.7 to 17.4 %).\nHigh mica content in the sand fraction indicates lack of weathering and the soils\nare rich in K. High base saturation with mild acidic to neutral soil reaction must\nhave favoured formationof smectitesbesides illites(Sahu et al. 1990)\nThe orthoclase and mica inVertisols of Orissa varies between 12.4 and 26.9 %\n\nand between 2.7 and 11.0 %, respectively. Their transformation/alteration\naccounts for the occurrence of illite. Abundance of Ca and Mg 2+ 2+ in an alkaline\nenvironment favours the formation of montmorilonite in the clay fraction. Nayak\net al. (2001) analysed the fine sand fraction (0.1 to 0.25 mm) of Alfisols and\nInceptisols of university farm (OUAT) at Bhubaneswar and reported that quartz\ndominated (55.0 - 80.5 % ) the fine sand fraction along with K bearing minerals\nlike orthoclase feldspar (9.5 -31.0 %), biotite and muscovite mica (0.5 -2%). The\nAlfisols contained more K bearing minerals than the Inceptisols (Table 4). In fine\nsand fraction (0.1 -0.25 mm) of soils of Kanchinala micro watershed under coastal\nplains of Mahanadi delta of Orissa. Mishra (2008) observed a considerable\namount of K bearing minerals like orthoclase, muscovite and biotite in upland,\nmedium land and low land soils (Table 5).

On the other hand the content of muscovite and biotite was in the order of\nupland > mediumland > lowland.\nWeathering process is generally influenced by cationic environment,\nespecially the base saturation of clays. An alkaline environment favours the\nformation of montmorillonite while acidic environment favours the formation of\n\nkaolinite and Mg rich environment produces vermiculite. Release of organic acids\nthrough decay of plant roots by microbes accelerates the process of weathering. In\nlaterite soils under rice-rice cropping system (Pattanayak 1992) the allophane\ncontent was increased from 0.04 (initial value) to 0.048 in control, and 066 in\n150% NPK treatment. Lower content of allophane (0.012) was observed in fallow\ntreatment. Intensive cultivation of rice-rice cropping system for 18 years with\n100% NPK increased the illite content. The content of interstratified smectite was\n\nhigher in 100% NPK + FYM and illite with interstratified smectite in 150 % NPK\ntreatment(Table 6).\n\n\n**Table 6** Occurrence of clay minerals as affected by long term manure and\nfertilizer applications in rice-rice cropping system (expressed as dspacing in Mg saturationand glycolatedclay)\n\n|Treatments|14-17 A0|10.1-14 A0|10.1 A0|7.1 A0|4.26 A0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Control<br>100% NPK<br>100% NPK+FYM<br>150% NPK<br>Initial|27.5<br>29.5<br>35.0<br>36.2<br>35.5|27.0<br>30.3<br>33.6<br>14.7<br>28.7|19.1<br>16.2<br>11.5<br>18.9<br>13.8|27.4<br>24.0<br>19.2<br>29.7<br>23.4|0.8<br>-<br>0.7<br>0.6<br>0.6|\n\n\n\nSource:\ufffdPattnayak\ufffd1992\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdstatus**\n\n\nSoils of Orissa are considered as medium to high in available potassium. Coastal\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\nsaline soils are high in exchangeable-K (56.6 to 624 mg kg ) and water soluble-K\n(117 to 624 mg kg ). Alluvial soils have wide rage of K status. The extreme low -1\nvalues of exchangeable-K and percent K saturation in alluvial and red soils\nindicated the higher K removal from non-exchangeable sites under high cropping\nintensity. The total K\ufffdO content ranges from 0.30 to 1.20 % in laterite soils, 1.62 to 2\n6.03 % in mixed red and black soils, 0.68 to 2.41% in alluvial soils, and 1.77 to\n3.01% in coastal saline soils. Non-exchangeable K constitutes 21 to 64% of total\nK, highest being in alluvial soils where as the exchangeable K constitutes between\n12.5 to 35.7 % of total K. In rice-groundnut growing soils of Alhagarh in Cuttack\ndistrict (Pal et al. 2001) total K ranged from 950 to 2400 mg kg . Ammonium -1\nacetate extractable K constitutes 3 to 12%, non-exchangeable K 14 to 45% and\nlattice-K 48-80% of the total K. Total K content in surface soils of an watershed in\n\nKhajuripada block of Kandhamal district with rice-pulse cropping system varied\nbetween 1100 to 2600 mg kg (Das et al. 1997). Total K content increased with -1\ndecrease in elevation of the watershed. In all the three profiles (foot hill, mid\nupland and medium valley), water soluble K decreased whereas nonexchangeable, lattice K and total K increased with depth, probably due to increase\nin clay content. Lattice K constitutes 53 to 73 %, non-exchangeable and\nexchangeableK from 24.8 to 41.8 and 2.8 to 3.7 % of totalK, respectively.\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Interrelationship\ufffdof\ufffdforms\ufffdof\ufffdK**\n\n\nExchangeable, non-exchangeable, lattice and total K of 21 alluvial soil samples\ncollected from rice-groundnut cropping system (Pal et al. 2001) and rice-pulse\ncropping system (Sahu 1994) in Badamba block of Cuttack district were\npositively correlated with each otherThe dynamic equilibrium was existed among\ndifferent pools and depletion of K from one pool is replenished from the other\npools of soil K.\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdtransformation**\n\n\nThe rate at which K is released from non-exchangeable sources is an index of the\nability of soil to supply K to crops. The rate and magnitude of release depend on\nthe level of K in soil solution and amount and type of clay minerals present in soil\n(Martin and Spark 1985).The contribution of release of non-exchangeable K to Kavailability has been reported by several workers (Sparks 2000, Parker et al. 1989\nb). The rate of release of non-exchangeable K is influenced by the degree of\nexposure of edges of clay minerals to the soil solution. In some soils the release of\nnon-exchangeable K may be slow and restrict crop yield, where as in some cases it\nmay be rapid to meet the K requirement of crops. The release kinetics of eight soil\nseries in Indo-Gangetic plain of India (Sekhon et al.1992) showed that Kaolinite\ndominated alluvial soils and smectitic acidic alluvial soils in lower Gangetic plain\n\n\n\n422 423\n\n\nshowed lower rate of K release from the non-exchangeable fraction than that of\nilliticalluvialsoils.\n\nIn rice-rice cropping system in Inceptisols and soyabean-wheat-cowpea in\nVertisols (Typic Haplusterts), the total K uptake by crops exceeded the amount of\nK applied. The plots which did not receive K fertilizer (control, N and NP\ntreatment) in soybean-wheat-cowpea system contributed K to the extent of 3129\nto 9932 kg ha from non-exchangeable source as against 1183 to 1891 kg ha in -1 -1\nrice-rice system. The results of LTFE trials clearly showed that mining of K\noccurred with N, NPand even with NPK application(Rupa et al. 2003)\nResults from two long term fertilizer experiments conducted at Bhubaneswar\nwith rice-rice cropping system and at Keonjhar with rice-oilseed/pulse cropping\nsystem representing two different agro-climatic regions of Orissa showed that in\nrice-rice cropping system there was sharp increase in available K in the first 10\nyears of cropping followed by a rapid fall between 1980-1983 and almost\nplateauing afterwards in all treatments except NPK+FYM treatment (Fig. 1). The\ntreatment that received 100% NP but no K always recorded lowest NH\ufffdOAC K 4\nfollowed by 50% NPK treatment. On the other hand 150% NPK treatment\nrecorded highest value of NH\ufffdOAC K followed by 100 % NPK treatment. In 4\nmixed red and black soil of Keonjhar with rice-mustard cropping system, the\n\n\n                                                                                                \nNH\ufffdOAC K in surface increased rapidly by nearly 100% than the initial (144 kg ha 4\n\n1 ) probably due to bringing the uncultivated barren land under cultivation and\n\nincrease in organic matter content ( 0.23 to 0.55%). Subsequently there was a\n\n\n-1\n\ngradual drop of NH\ufffdOAC K to the extentof 25 to 75 kg ha (Fig. 2) 4\n\n\n\n**Fig. 2**\n\n\n\nVariation in NH\ufffdOAC extractable (available) K status of soil under long 4\nterm manuring at Keonjhar centre\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**90**\n\n\n**80**\n\n\n**70**\n\n\n**60**\n\n\n**50**\n\n\n**40**\n\n\n**30**\n\n\n**20**\n\n\n**10**\n\n\n**0**\n\n\n**1972** **1972-74** **1975-77** **1978-80** **1981-83** **1984-86** **1987-89** **1990-92**\n\n\n**Period**\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a gradual decrease of HNO \u2013K over the years and after 20 years it 3\nreached almost 50% of the initial level particularly in the treatments that received\nK every year (Fig. 3). Maximum decrease was recorded in NP followed by\nNPK+FYM treatment. The decrease in latter treatment might be due to relatively\nmuch higher cumulative uptake of K by crops associated with higher biomass\nyield. The depletion of 1N HNO\ufffd-K could maintain large amount of potassium in 3\nsoil solution and exchange sites by reestablishing the equilibrium among different\nforms of K. Multiple correlation studies revealed that, both NH\ufffdOAC and 1N 4\nHNO extractable K in soil in various treatments of LTFE trials were significantly 3\ncorrelated to the K balance indicating a strong influence of K application and\nuptakeon the extractableK status of surface soil.\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n**Fig. 1** Variation in NH\ufffdOAC extractable (available) K status of soil (3 years 4\n\naverage)under long term manuringat Bhubaneswar centre\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**90**\n\n\n**80**\n\n\n**70**\n\n\n**60**\n\n\n**50**\n\n\n**40**\n\n\n**30**\n\n\n**20**\n\n\n**10**\n\n\n**0**\n\n\n\n**1972** **1972-74** **1975-77** **1978-80** **1981-83** **1984-86** **1987-89** **1990-92**\n\n\n**Period**\n\n\n\n**300**\n\n\n**250**\n\n\n**200**\n\n\n**150**\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**50**\n\n\n**0**\n\n\n\n**Fig. 3**\n\n\n\nVariationin 1N HNO extractableK over the years at Bhubaneswar 3\n\n\n\n\n\n**1972** **1982** **1986** **1990** **1993**\n\n\n**Period**\n\n\n424 425\n\n\nDobermann and Fairhurst (2000) suggested K saturation as a better indicator\nfor K supply of soils. He categorized rice soils with less than 1.5% K saturation as\nlow K, with 1.5\u20132.5% K saturation as medium K and with more than 2.5% K\nsaturation as high K soils. The K saturation of broad soil groups of Orissa were in\nthe order of: black soils (5.54%) > coastal saline soils (4.32%) > laterite soils\n(2.7%) > alluvial soils (2.35%).Although K saturation of Orissa soils come under\nhigh category, still good response to K application was recorded in alluvial and\nlaterite soils where as there was no response in coastal saline soils. However,\noptimum dose of K for crops in coastal saline soils is recommended to suppress Na\nuptake.\n\n\n**Contribution\ufffdof\ufffdsubsurface\ufffdK\ufffdto\ufffdplant\ufffduptake**\n\n\n\ncounter act to replace structural potassium (Kirk et al. 1993). This was observed in\nrice- rice system at Bhubaneswar due to decrease in total K in all the three layers\nover 15 years of cropping.\n\n\n**Potassium\ufffdrelease\ufffdcharacteristics**\n\n\n\nst\n\n\n\n-1 th\n\n\n\nth\n\n\n\nSubsurface K contributes significantly to plant nutrition. The difference in\nmineralogy and K reserve in subsurface horizon influences the subsurface K\navailability. Results of 15 years of rice-rice cropping at Bhubaneswar revealed that\nalthough NH\ufffdOAC \u2013K of the surface layer was higher than the initial value, the sub 4\nsurface layers showed a lower status as compared to initial value. On the other\nhand, there was substantial decrease in 1N HNO\ufffd-K in all the layers indicating the 3\ncontribution of non exchangeable K towards K nutrition of crops. Similar findings\nwere also observed with respect to NH\ufffdOAc\u2013K and HNO \u2013K at Keonjhar after 10 4 3\nyears of cropping.\nThese results indicated that at Bhubaneswar NH\ufffdOAc\u2013K in different layers 4\nshowed very poor correlation with K balance. On the contrary significant\ncorrelation existed between HNO \u2013K of each layer and K balance (r=0.85**, 3\n0.72** and 0.74** for 0-0.15, 0.15-0.30 and 0.30-0.45m layer), respectively.\nAround 68% of the variation of HNO \u2013K of 0-0.15 m layer were accounted for K 3\nbalance. A measure of total K in all the three layers also shows a substantial\nvariation from the initial value. A drop in total K at the end of 1987-88 was many\ntimes higher than the decrease in NH\ufffdOAc\u2013K and HNO \u2013K indicating that 4 3\nweatherable K bearing minerals in surface and sub surface layers make a major\ncontribution to plant uptake K. Singh et al. (2002 b) reported that application of\norganic manures along with urea \u2013N increased the cumulative non \u2013 exchangeable\nK release and could maintain large amount of K in soil solution on exchange sites\nby reestablishing the equilibrium among different forms of K. In rice-rice\ncropping system at Bhubaneswar, NPK + FYM treatment encourage release of\nmore non \u2013 exchangeable K under acidic environment to meet crop requirement\nof K.Wihandjaka et al. (1999) observed that mobilization of non-exchangeable K\nin flooded rice is due to root induced acidification and removal of K from soil\n\n\n+\n\nsolution by roots. Under flooded rice ecosystem, release of hydronium ion (H\ufffdO ) 3\nfrom roots and decomposition of organic manures and plant residue, actively\n\n\n\nStep K provides estimation of K availability from the non\u2013exchangeable sources\nand constant rate K (CR-K) is a measure of difficulty available K of mineral lattice\nsource. The K release characteristics of 21 surface soil samples of laterite soils\nwith rice based cropping system revealed that step K was maximum in the 1 st\nextraction and varied from 150 to 700 mg kg and gradually decreased to zero in 6 -1 th\nand 7 extraction (Pal et al. 2001). Higher values of step K is associated with th\ngreater release of K from non\u2013exchangeable K under stress condition. The CR- K,\ntotal step K and total exchangeable K in soils varies between 12-56, 140-1332 and\n500-1592 mg kg . The correlation coefficient of K release parameter with -1\ndifferent forms of K showed that exchangeable, non\u2013exchangeable, lattice and\ntotal K were positively correlated with each other suggesting the existence of\ndynamic equilibrium among the different pools of K in soil. Highly significant and\npositive correlation between step K with HNO K indicates that HNO K could 3 3\nserve as a good index of plant available non\u2013exchangeable K in soil. In alluvial\nsoils with rice based cropping system, the step K was maximum in the 1 st\nextraction and varied between 104 and 1510 mg kg -1 and gradually decreased with\nincrease in number of extraction (Sahu 1994). Constant rate K (CR K) values\nvaried from 8 to 44 mg kg, which indicate adequate supply of lattice K to plants. -1\nThe total extractable K varied from 442 to 1792 mg kg soil. In a long term -1\nfertilizer experiment (LTFE) with rice-rice cropping system sequential stepwise\nextraction with boiling HNO 3 yielded two categories of K viz. CR K, released\nfrom mineral lattice at a fairly constant rate and step K released from edge and\nwedge zone of micaceous minerals, the amount of which was negligible after 3 rd\nextraction (Senapati 1993). There was little difference of CR K in different\ntreatments(Table 7).\nThere was a quite large difference in step-K. The NPK treatments recorded\nmuch higher step K values compared to NP treatments in all the three layers of\nsoil indicating their potentiality to release K for crop uptake.

However, at super-optimal level (150% NPK) the K\ndepletion was decreased to 41.0 and 26.0 kg ha in rice \u2013 green gram and rice- -1\ngroundnut cropping system, respectively(Fig. 5, 6).\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Management of potassium**\n\n\n\nSoil type, mineralogy, K fixation, amount and leaching loss of K should be\nconsidered while fixing the dose of K for different crops. Potassium fixation\nstudies have revealed that soils become more hungry for K fixation with the\ncontinuation of negative balance. Illite soils fixed 23-29% of applied K, kaolinite\nand smectite soils 17-23% and 26-32%, respectively (Srinivas-Rao et al. 2000).\nMaintenance of shallow surface submergence in rice-rice cropping system in soils\ncontaining 2:1 clay minerals may increase K fixation and reduce solution K, thus\nincreasingthe rice dependenceon non-exchangeablereserve for K uptake.\nLeaching losses of K is a major concern under frequent intense rainfall\nconditions in well drained soils of humid tropics. Leaching tends to be a problem\nin soils with low CEC. The leaching losses of K in loam and sandy loam profiles\nunder submerged moisture regime were 22 and 16% of applied K, respectively\n(Singh et al. 2004). Therefore, either K application level should be increased by\n25-50% or the rice residues, which contain huge quantity of K (88-92% of total\nuptake), be recycled in the soil. Even burning of rice straw in field is a better option\nthan its removal (Prasad 2007). Split application of K in the ratio of 1:1 at peak\ntillering and PI stage is recommended to rice to reduce the chaff percent and\nincreasetest weight.\n\n\n-1\n\nGenerally application of N, P\ufffdO and K O @ 20:40:40 kg ha is recommended 2 5 2\n\n\n-1\n\nfor groundnut in most of the soils of Orissa.Application of 40 kg K\ufffdO ha with NP 2\nto summer groundnut grown on the lateritic soils of Bhubaneswar significantly\nincreased yield from 10.60 q ha -1 to 15.88 q ha . Benefits of use of potassic -1\nfertilizers on pulses were also observed in the K deficient Balisahi series. Green\n\n\n-1\n\ngram yield was significantly increases due to application of 30 kg K\ufffdO ha . The 2\nrecommended application (100% NPK) to rice \u2013 pulse and rice \u2013 oilseeds\ncropping system recorded highest yield and benefit:cost ratio. There was\nsignificant response to super optimal dose (150%) of NPK in alluvial and laterite\nsoils having medium to high organic carbon status. Basal application of K @ 40 kg\nha at sowing is recommended for pulse crops in Orissa. Split application of K in -1\nthe ratio of 1:1:1 at planting, 30 and 60 days after planting is recommended for\nvegetable crops like cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, tomato and spices like chilli.\nBasal application of 30 kg K ha for mustard and 60 kg K ha for sunflower is -1 -1\nrecommended for higher yield and oil content. Integrated application of K with N,\n\n\n\nPand FYM improve the nutrient use efficiency and yield and hence recommended\nfor higher profit.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\nThe mining of K will limit crop yield and it may not be possible to maintain the\npresent production. Results of long term fertilizer trials with rice-rice and ricepulse cropping systems indicated that gradually the magnitude of response to\napplied K increased as K becomes limiting factor.Application of FYM, recycling\nof crop residues and green manuring can help to improve K balance in different\ncropping systems. Significant correlation of HNO\ufffd-K with K balance and yield 3\nsuggest its inclusion in soil testing laboratories. K balance in different cropping\nsystems, based on precise data on K removal, K inputs from irrigation water or rain\nwater, straw recycling besides fertilizers and manures needs to be worked out.\nStraw management can strongly influence K budget and can help in efficient\nmanagement of K for a sustainable cropping systems in different regions. A\nsustainable fertilizer management strategy must ensure the farm productivity,\noptimumeconomicreturn without deteriorationof agriculturalenvironment.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nDas PK, Sahu GC, Das N (1997)Vertical distribution and release characteristics of\npotassium in some lateriticsoils of Orissa.

Rye grass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) based rotations on a loamy\nsand derived from granitic bedrock were studied over 30 years with two Kfertilisation regimes, nil (K0) and 65 kg K ha yr . Mineralogical and chemical -1 -1\nmethods were combined to identify and quantify soil K resources including the\npartitioning of K between minerals. Two or three cuts were taken annually and\nherbage yield and composition together with exchangeable soil K were analysed.\nHerbage yield declined with time and significantly reduced when the K\nconcentrations approached 1%. The grass K concentration also declined over time\nand stabilized at around 0.5-0.7% (dw) in K0 in all cuts. Input-output mass\nbalances showed an accumulated net K off-take (deficit) of 1100 kg ha, i.e. 35 kg -1\nha yr . With an exchangeable K pool of 100 kg ha (in the rooting zone 0-40 cm) -1 -1 -1\nthis indicated a substantial release of K from mineral sources, most probably\nbiotite and hydrobiotite. Assuming a similar net off-take was continued then this\nparticular mineralogical K source would be depleted within two centuries. The\nstudy illustrates the strength of combining long-term field experimental data with\nstate of the art quantitative mineralogical methods in order to assess site-specific\nresources which can form a basis to evaluate the sustainability of different\nmanagementpractices.\n\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\n\n_Lolium perenne_\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1 -1\n\n\n\n**Keywords** Depletion \ufffd perennial ryegrass \ufffd potassium release \ufffd soil minerals\n\nweathering\n\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\nI \u00d6born AC Edwards SHillier \ufffd \ufffd\n\nMacaulayInstitute,Craigiebuckler,AberdeenAB158QH,UK\nI \u00d6born\n\nDep.

While much emphasis has been given to quantifying\nnitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances at geographical scales ranging from\nfield to nation, similar calculations are not generally reported for potassium (K).\nOne notable exception is Foy et al. (2002). A lack of any obvious environmental\nconcerns associated with a K surplus is probably the main factor responsible for\nthis omission. This general situation is changing due to factors such as the\nincreased price of agricultural inputs including K fertilisers. Evidence for a\ndecline in soil K status has been provided through the regular monitoring of\nagricultural soils in England and Wales (Goulding and Loveland 1986; Skinner\nandTodd 1998) where both regional and temporal trends in soil extractable K were\ndescribed for the previous 25 years. There was some indication for a wider decline\nin K status, particularly evident for grassland, with 20% of all fields sampled in the\nNorthern region having a low K status (index 0). Declining rates of K fertiliser\ncoupled with manure applications determined on the basis of their N content has\nresulted in a wide ranging annual K balance within cropping systems of NW\nEurope (e.g. Askegaard and Eriksen 2002; Alfaro et al. 2003; Berry et al. 2003;\nKayser and Isselstein 2005; \u00d6born et al. 2005a, b). Also in other geographical\nregions negative K balances in agricultural production systems have been reported\nurging for intensified research efforts on K management and dynamics in different\nsoil types, climatic regions and cropping systems (e.g. Bedrossian and Singh\n2004; Bell et al 2009). Greatly increased crop yields and nutrient off-take in\nharvested products have exacerbated this situation. Losses of K can also be\nassociated with home produced forage crops and recycling of manure/urine (e.g.\n\u00d6born et al. 2005b; Gustafson et al. 2007), and/or where excessive leaching occurs\nfrom coarse textured soils (e.g. Wulff et al. 1998; Askegaard and Eriksen 2008).\nWithin systems managed organically negative K field balances have also been\nreported (e.g. Watson et al. 2002; Askegaard et al. 2003; Bengtsson et al. 2003),\nand there is a growing concern about net off-take of K and how to sustain the soil\nfertility, harvest level and crop quality (e.g. Fortune et al. 2005). Export of\nnutrients accompanies the sale of all agricultural produce and inherent sitespecific soil properties such as mineralogy and texture coupled with climatic\nfactors and farming system determine the likely long-term significance of any\npotential K deficiency (e.g. Heming 2004;Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007; Simonsson\net al. 2007; Barr\u00e9 et al. 2008; 2009).\nThe significant contribution that soil minerals can make to plant available K\nmeans that this aspect should also be considered in addition to fertiliser and\nmanure inputs. While lack of total soil K (Tot-K) reserves (organic soils being an\nexception) is not often an issue, it is possible that short-term deficits of plant\n\n\n\navailable K, for example, during the later part of the pasture growing season may\noccur (e.g. Brady and Weil 1996). During these times the rates of exchange\nbetween various soil K sources need to be considered. Various soil K pools have\nbeen defined as, soil solution K, exchangeable K, fixed or non-exchangeable K\nbound in the inter-layer positions, e.g. of weathered micas, vermiculites etc., and\nfinally structural K particularly associated with micas and K-feldspars (e.g.\nSparks and Huang 1985; Sparks 1987; Huang 1989; Robert 1992). The dynamic\nsituation that exists between the K pools determines the plant available K and is\namong other things influenced by plant properties such as root density and rooting\ndepth (e.g. Haak 1981; Kuhlmann 1990; Witter and Johansson 2001), climatic\nconditions (soil temperature and moisture) (e.g. Holmqvist et al. 2003), soil\nattributes (organic acids, pH, particle size distribution etc) as well as type of K\nbearing minerals (e.g.Wilson 1992; 2004; Hinsinger and Jaillard 1993; Barr\u00e9 et al.\n2007; 2008) and management practices (e.g. Singh and Goulding 1997;\nSimonsson et al. 2007).\nThis paper describes the long-term soil-plant K dynamics for a grass ( _Lolium_\n\n_perenne_ L.) based rotation growing on a loamy sand soil derived from granitic\n\nbedrock. Treatments without or with annual fertiliser K additions are compared\nover a 30 year period and the system sustainability including the plant\nperformance and K delivering capacity of the soil parent material are considered.\nIt was hypothesised that K-bearing soil minerals could supply sufficient K to\nmaintaingrass herbage production in low input systems.\n\n\nThe specificobjectiveswere to:\ni) Assess the annual and within year performance of herbage biomass\nproduction and K concentrationof ryegrass herbage;\nii) Establish annual and long-term K input-output mass balances in order to\nidentifymajorsources and sinks and assess temporaltrends;\niii) Study trends in plantavailable(aceticacidextractable)K, and\niv) Quantify individual chemical and mineralogical soil K pools in order to\ndeterminetheir potentialcontributionsto long-termplant availableK.\n\n\n**Materialsand Methods**\n\n\nSite and soil description\n\n\n\nThe experimental site was located on Macaulay Institute grounds at\nCraigiebuckler (57 8'N, 2 9'W), Aberdeen, NE Scotland. The mean annual o o\naverage temperature and rainfall were 7.9 o C and 791 mm, respectively (1961-80;\nDyce airport 57 12'N, 2 12'W) (Broad and Hough 1993). Precipitation was o o\nmeasured on the experimental site 1968-95 and the monthly averages were used\nwhen evaluating the uptake rates. The average growing season (6 C) in the area o\n\n\n\no o\n\n\n\no C\n\n\n\no o\n\n\n\no\n\n\n\n438 439\n\n\nwas 215 days (s.d. 14 days) lasting from 8 April to 10 November (Broad and\nHough 1993).\nThe soil was classified as Dystric Cambisol (FAO) or Typic Fragiorthod (Soil\nTaxonomy) (Adamo et al. 1998). According to Scottish terminology it is a freely\ndraining iron humus podsol developed in glacial till derived from granitic bedrock\nand it belongs to the Countesswells Association and Dess Series (Glentworth and\nMuir 1963). Soil and profile characteristics of the experimental site are given in\nTable 1.\n\n\nExperimentaldesign\n\n\n\nThe field experiment was established in 1968 and had a randomised block design\nwith two K treatments, K65 which received 65 kg K ha yr (as KCl) and K0 which -1 -1\nreceived no K, and five replicates.Three experimental phases could be defined; an\ninitial 12 year period of grass (Grass I, two cuts per year) followed by 6 years with\ncereals (Cereal), and a final 11 years of grass (Grass II, three cuts per year). The\ntiming of the cuts, i.e. the growth stage of the grass, was set to mimic the hay/silage\ncuts by farmers. During the two grass periods the K65 plots received fertiliser\nannually during the spring. All plots also received a basal N (50 kg N ha yr ) -1 -1\ndressing as nitrochalk at the start of the growing season and after each cut, i.e. in\ntotal 100 kg N ha yr for Grass I and 150 kg N ha yr for Grass II. During the six- -1 -1 -1 -1\nyear cereal period a similar annual basal N, P and K dressing was applied to all\nplots (75-85 kg N, 19-21 kg P and 63-74 kg K). The cropping sequence therefore\nconsisted of perennial ryegrass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) established in 1969 (Grass I)\nand 1987/88 (Grass II) with the cereal phase consisting of four years of spring\nbarley ( _Hordeum vulgare,_ L.), one year of oats ( _Avena sativa_ L.), and one year of\nwinter wheat ( _Triticum aestivum,_ L.).\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1 -1 -1\n\n\n\n_Lolium perenne_\n\n\n\n_Hordeum vulgare,_ L.), one year of oats ( _Avena sativa_\n_Triticum aestivum,_ L.).\n\n\n\nSamplingand sample treatment\n\n\nResponsibility for sample collection and analysis changed over the 30 year\nexperimental period, however, protocols were all well documented and analytical\ndataconsistentlyrecorded.\n\n\n_Plantsampling and preparation_\n\n\n\nTotal herbage biomass yield was recorded at each cut, and a sub-sample taken for\ndry matter determination and chemical analyses. All remaining herbage was\nremoved from the field to simulate a hay/silage situation. Prior to digestion and\nchemical analyses herbage samples were dried at 60 C and milled. For cereals, the o\ngrain weight was recorded and sub-samples taken and prepared for analysis.

For budget calculations the straw weight was estimated\nusing a grain:straw ratio of 1:1 (Hanson 1990). In two years, 1981 (grass) and 1985\n(barley), the plots were cut and cleared but no yield recorded, on these occasions\nthe average K removal from grass 1978-80, and barley 1982 and 84, were used in\nbudget calculationsas estimatesfor 1981 (grass) and 1985 (barley), respectively.\n\n\n_Soil sampling and sample preparation_\n\n\nSurface soil (0-15 cm) was collected annually in the autumn (after the last herbage\ncut) 1968 to 1987 when approximately 10 sub-samples were taken from each plot\nwith a screw auger. InApril 1998 (before the fertilisation), soil samples were taken\nfrom three surface horizons, 0-5 cm (Ap1), 5-15 (Ap2) and 15-25 cm (Ap3), and\none subsurface horizon within the rooting depth (B, 25-40 cm). When possible\n(only in 5 plots because it was very stony), the BC-horizon (40-60 cm) was\nsampled.Within each plot 20, 10, 10 and 5 sub-samples were taken from 0-5 cm, 515, 15-25 cm, and 25-40 cm depths respectively.Acore sampler was used for the 025 cm samples and a screw auger for the 25-60 cm depth. The C-horizon (60-80\ncm) was also sampled in three soil pits located immediately adjacent to the\nexperimental plots. In total 0.5-1 kg soil per plot and horizon was taken. The soil\nwas sieved fresh at 2 mm and air-dried at 30 C prior to the analyses. The o\nmineralogical analyses were carried out on pooled composite samples from the\ndifferent horizons.\n\n\n_Soil bulk density_\n\n\nThe bulk density for each soil horizon was determined in the three soil pits\n(0.5*0.5*0.5 m). All soil from each horizon was removed, and the volume of the\nremoved horizon was carefully measured in the soil pit. The soil was air dried,\nsieved and the <2mm fraction weighed and its bulk density calculated for each\nhorizon. The average values from the three profiles (Table 1) were used in the\ncalculationand expression of soil K dataon an aerialbasis.\n\n\nPlant and soil analyses\n\n\n_Plantanalyses_\n\n\nThe crop samples were wet-digested and K was analysed by flame photometry\n(1969-88) or ICP-AES (1989-1998). The straw K concentration measured in 1987\nin the K0 and K65 treatments, respectively, were used as general estimates for the\nstraw K concentration in the two treatments. The weighted annual average K\nconcentrations were calculated for the grass cuts and used in graphs and budget\n\n\n\ncalculations.\n\n\n_Soil analyses_\n\n\n\nAcetic acid extractable-K (Ac-K) was determined annually on soil collected from\nindividual plots between 1969 and 1987, and then in 1990, 1991 and in 1998.Airdried soil (2.5 g) was extracted by 100 ml 2.5% acetic acid (MISR/SAC 1985) and\nK was analysed by flame photometry (1969-88) or ICP-AES (1988-1998). In\naddition, a subset of samples (n=10) were extracted with 1 M ammonium acetate\n(NH\ufffdAc pH 7) (Rowell 1994) and analysed by ICP-AES in order to relate theAc-K 4\nextraction to an internationally frequently used extraction for exchangeable K.\nAcetic acid (2.5%) extracted on average 94% of 1 M NH\ufffdAc andAc-K will in this 4\npaper be used as a proxy for exchangeable K. Aqua-regia K (Aq-K) was extracted\nby 3:1 50% HCl:conc. HNO (by volume) (McGrath and Cunliffe 1985; McGrath 3\n1987) and analysed by ICP-AES. Total-K (Tot-K) was determined by X-ray\nfluorescence (XRF) using a Philips PW 1404 spectrometer and the methods by\nNorrish and Hutton (1969) for sample fusion and corrections for interelement\neffects.\n\nFor determination of the mineralogical composition 3 g soil (<2 mm) was\nground in an agate McCrone mill for 12 min with 9 g of liquid (0.5% polyvinyl\nalcohol and 2 drops of octanol) and spray dried as per Hillier (1999). X-ray powder\ndiffraction (XRPD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5000 instrument from\n\n2-75\u00b02\u03b8 using Cobalt K\u03b1 radiation, in 0.02\u00b0 steps counting for 2 seconds per step.\nThe resulting XRPD patterns were quantified by full-pattern fitting as described in\ndetail by Omotoso et al.

Uncertainty at 95% confidence is\n\ngiven by X 0.35, where X is concentration in weight percent (Hillier 2003).\nMineralogical analyses were carried out on composite samples from the\nexperimental plots. The partitioning of K amongst the identified mineral phases\nwas estimated using assumed chemical compositions (Table 2) (Andrist-Rangel et\nal. 2006;Andrist-Rangel 2008).\n\n\n\n**Table\ufffd2** K-bearing\ufffdmineral\ufffdphases\ufffdand\ufffdtheir\ufffdassumed\ufffdelemental\ufffdcomposition\nused\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdnormative\ufffdcalculations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Mineral phase|Elementalcomposition|\n|---|---|\n|K-feldspar<br>Muscovite<br>Illite<br>Biotite<br>Hydrobiotite|KAlSi O<br>KAl (AlSi O  )(OH)<br>K Al<br>Mg Fe<br>Ca<br>Na<br>Si O  (OH)<br>KMg Fe<br>AlSi O  (OH)<br>K Mg Fe<br>Fe<br>AlSi O  (OH)<br>3<br>8<br>2<br>3<br>10<br>2<br>0.6<br>2.15<br>0.3<br>0.22<br>0.05<br>0.03<br>3.4<br>10<br>2<br>1.5<br>1.5<br>3<br>10<br>2<br>0.5<br>1.5<br>1.0<br>0.5<br>3<br>10<br>2<br>III<br>II<br>II<br>III|\n\n\n442 443\n\n\nK input-outputmass balancecalculations\n\n\n\nInput-output mass balance for K was calculated for the two K treatments\n(Equation 1).

The yield for K0 continued to decline until an apparent plateau at\nabout 6 t ha -1 was reached, and from the seventh year the K65 plots had a\nsignificantly higher production (Fig. 1a). After the break years with cereals no\nsignificant differences in biomass harvest for the first two years of Grass II were\napparent, but from the third year until the end of the period the K65 plots showed a\nsignificantly higher yield (Fig. 1a). The accumulated herbage yield over the two\n\n\n\nDep was estimated from an average rain water concentration of 5 g L K \ufffd\nmeasured by Reid et al. (1981) and the mean annual precipitation for 1961-80.The\nrun-off was calculated from mean monthly data on precipitation and\nevapotranspiration (1961-80).

For cut 2 and cut 3\nthe days elapsed between the grass cuts was used.\nThe root length density (cm cm ) from an established grass sward on an -3\nadjacent field with the same soil type was used to estimate the K uptake from\ndifferent soil depths (Edwards et al. 1987). Edwards et al. (1987) determined the\nroot length density using soil cores subdivided into the depths; 0-5, 5-15, 1525(/30) cm (subsoil boundary) and subsoil (30-45 cm). The root length density\nwas highest in the upper 0-5 cm where it was 25-30 cm cm . The main part of the -3\nroots, 42%, were found in the upper 0-5 cm, 21% in each of the 5-15 and 15-25 cm\nlayers, respectively(Table 1).\n\n\n\n**Fig. 1** Annual (a) biomass yield (tonnes dry weight (dw) ha ), (b) potassium (K)\nconcentration (% dw) in the grass herbage given as weighted mean for the\ncuts, (c) K removal by crop off-take (kg K ha ), and (d) net off-take of K -1\n(Input via K-fertiliser \u2013 Output via harvested biomass, kg K ha ), in the K0 -1\n\n( ) and K65 (\u25b2 ) treatments in the field experiment.

In the K65 treatment, herbage K concentration was\nhighest (1.5%) in cut 1, decreasing to 1.1 and 1.0 % in cut 2 and 3, respectively\n(Table 3). Herbage K concentration was low (0.7 %) in K0 and remained similar\nthroughout the growing season.An estimate of daily K 'uptake rate' was calculated\nfor individual cuts and it declined substantially from the first to the third cut in both\nK65 and K0 (Table 3). The uptake rate of K was always greater for K65 than K0\nand the decline was larger in K65 as compared to K0. The K uptake rate was not\nsignificantly related (with simple linear regression) to the accumulated\nprecipitation during the growth period (roughlyApril-May for cut 1, June-July for\ncut 2 andAugust-September for cut 3) (data not shown).\n\n\n\ngrass phases was 140 and 180 t ha for K0 and K65, respectively, or 7 and 9 t ha yr \n1 if expressed on averageannual bases.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n_Herbage K concentrations_\n\n\nThe annually averaged herbage K concentration decreased significantly in K0 and\nK65 treatments during both Grass I and II periods (Fig. 1b).The K65 herbage had a\n\n\n\n446 447\n\n\nPotassium off-take and K input-outputmass balances\n\n\n_Annual K removal and net off-takeby biomass harvest_\n\n\n\nThe total amount of K removed annually in the harvested biomass declined with\ntime but was always significantly greater for any given year in the K65 treatment\ncompared to the K0 treatment (Fig. 1c). The annual net K off-take was calculated\nas the fertiliser derived input minus the K removed in harvested biomass (Fig. 1d).\nDuring the first two years of Grass I the deficit was large, being more than 100 kg\nK ha yr (Fig. 1d). Thereafter crop removal exceeded fertiliser application by 55- -1 -1\n70 kg K ha yr during a five year period, followed by four years with a smaller net -1 -1\nK off-take of around 30 kg ha yr . There was generally no significant difference -1 -1\nin net off-take between the K0 and K65 plots during Grass I. Grass II showed a\nsimilar pattern with a net off-take between 90 and 100 kg K ha yr the first year, -1 -1\nthereafter 55-85 kg ha yr for two years, and 40 kg ha yr during the final years -1 -1 -1 -1\n(Fig. 1d). There was no significant difference in net off-take between K0 and K65\nfor six years of Grass II.\n\n\n\n**Table 4** Annual K mass balances, kg K ha yr, for the three periods: (i) 11 years of -1 -1\ngrass (Grass I, 1970-80), (ii) 6 years of cereals (Cereals, 1982-87), and\n(iii) 9 years of grass (Grass II, 1989-97).The years when the rye grass was\nestablishedwere not included(1969, 1988)\n\n\n\n|Treatment|Inputs<br>Deposition|K-fertiliser|Outputs<br>Leaching|Harvest|Inputs-Outputs<br>Deficit/Surplus|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Grass I<br>K0<br>K65<br>Cereals<br>K0<br>K65<br>Grass II<br>K0<br>K65<br>a<br>a|1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4<br>1.4|0.0<br>65.0<br>62.6<br>73.5<br>0.0<br>65.0|0.8<br>2.3<br>0.8<br>2.3<br>0.8<br>2.3|66.6<br>128.4<br>47.8<br>62.9<br>47.7<br>119.9|-66.0<br>-64.3<br>+15.4<br>+ 9.7<br>-47.0<br>-55.7|\n\n\na During the period with cereals a basal NPK dressing was applied, except for\n\n1987 when the 0 and 65 kg K treatmentswere applied\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1 -1 -1\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\n_Input-outputK mass balances_\n\n\n\nThe input-output mass balance calculations for the entire period showed an annual\nK deficit during the two grass periods (Grass I and Grass II) and a surplus during\nthe 6-years of cereals (Table 4). During Grass I, an average of 67 kg K ha yr was -1 -1\nremoved by herbage from the K0 plots whereas 128 kg K ha yr was removed -1 -1\nfrom the K65 plots. This resulted in K removal in the herbage greatly exceeding\nthe amount added as fertiliser and resulted in an annual deficit of about 65 kg K ha \n1, a value that was similar for both treatments. During Grass II the annual K\n\nremoval by herbage averaged 48 and 120 kg K ha for the K0 and K65 treatments, -1\nrespectively, and the K mass balance calculation showed an average deficit of 47\n(K0) and 56 (K65) kg K ha yr . The cereal crops all received K fertiliser, on -1 -1\naverage 63 (K0) and 73 (K65) kg K ha yr, and during that period the annual K -1 -1\nsurplus was 15 (K0) and 10 (K65) kg K ha yr (Table 4). -1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboth treatments, but the K0 plots overall showed a lowerAc-K than the K65 plots.\nA very dry summer could be a possible explanation for the high Ac-K\nconcentrations recorded by the end of the 6 year of Grass I (1976).Ac-K was only th\ndetermined on three occasions during Grass II, with the final sampling taking\nplace in spring, and although based on very few observations the concentrations\nappeared to be at similar (or lower) levels to those measured during the Grass I\nphase.\n\n\n_Soil K turnover rates_\n\n\nThe replenishment of the Ac-K pool in the topsoil (0-15 cm) was estimated for\nGrass I where annual data for net off-take (Fig. 1d) and Ac-K (Fig. 2) were\navailable. Replenishment was estimated based on two different assumptions (Fig.\n3); (1) all K (100%) in herbage was taken up in the top 15 cm, or (2) K was taken up\nproportional to the root distribution (Table 1), i.e. 63% in top 15 cm. With the first\nassumption, after the initial two years, the net K off-take was about double the\namount of the Ac-K for the following 5 year period, i.e. the ratio was around 2\nduring this time, indicating that the Ac-K pool was replenished twice a year (Fig.\n3).The K0 was replenished somewhat quicker than K65, i.e. the ratio was 2.3 (K0)\nand 1.8 (K65). During the final 4 years, the net K off-take was of a similar quantity\nas theAc-K pool, i.e. the ratio was close to 1 (K0 1.1 and K65 0.8), indicating that\nthe Ac-K pool was replenished once per year (Fig. 3).

The long-term dynamics\nof Ac-K in the surface soil (0-15 cm) showed an annual variation but also a clear\ndifference between the years with grass compared to those with cereals, the Ac-K\nconcentration being lower under grass (Fig. 2).

Potassium\nconcentrations were compared within profiles as well as between the K0 and K65\ntreatments.Tot-K concentration was significantly higher in the B and BC horizons\nas compared to theAp horizons (Table 5).Asimilar pattern was apparent forAq-K.\nAc-K was significantly higher in both Ap1 horizons compared to other soil\nhorizons, and it was higher in the K65 treatment as compared to the K0 (Table 5).\nThe Aq-K fraction represented 16-20% of Tot-K in the Ap and Bs horizons\nwhereas it accountedfor 30% in the BC horizon.\n\n\n\n_Soil mineralogicalcomposition and partitioningof totalK in the solid phase_\n\n\nThe quantitative XRPD analyses showed that about 30% of the soil minerals\ncontained K, and these minerals were partitioned one third as K-feldspar and two\nthirds as 2:1 phyllosilicates (Table 7). The dioctahedral micas, muscovite and\nillite, were the main phyllosilicates (12-15%), but there were also considerable\namounts (5-9%) of trioctahedral mica (biotite) and hydrobiotite, a common\nweatheringproduct of biotite.\nThe partitioning of K amongst the identified mineral phases showed that on\naverage 55% of the K was allocated in the form of K-feldspar, 32% in dioctahedral\nphyllosilicates and 12% in trioctahedral biotite and hydrobiotite. The results also\nshow that there was more K held in micas in the Bs- and B/C-horizons as compared\nto the surface layers (Ap1-Ap3), and this was especially evident with respect to the\ntrioctahedralmicamineralsbiotiteand hydrobiotite(Table 8).\n\n\n\nThe quantities of K within the various extractable fractions were calculated\nfor the horizons of the K0 and K65 soil profiles. TheAq-K and Tot-K soil pools in\nthe main rooting zone (0-40 cm) approximated 13 000 and 72 000 kg K ha, -1\nrespectively (Table 6).

It is\nreadily apparent from both herbage yield and K compositional data that especially\nthe K0 treatment K became the growth limiting nutrient element. The coarse soil\ntexture (loamy sand) and granitic parent material also contributed to make this\nstudy relevant for large areas of (medium to lower productive) agricultural land.\nBy combining detailed soil profile sampling including both chemical and\nmineralogical analyses with these accumulated negative K balances (net K offtake) an attempt has been made to quantify the underlying mechanisms controlling\nK cyclingin this soil.\n\n\nPotassium\u2013 the limitingnutrientfor plantgrowth\n\n\n\nthe first few years of the experiment (and then appeared to have stabilized there).\nThis is a minor change in relation to the accumulated net off-take (deficit), leaving\n1100-1150 kg K ha unaccounted for (Table 9), that presumably has originated -1\nfrom fixed and mineral bound K sources and/or was taken up by roots in deeper\nsoil horizons (below 15 cm).

First indications of a yield difference between\nK65 and K0 treatments occurred at herbage concentrations of ~ 1%. However, the\nspecies composition is an important factor to consider when determining the\ncritical K concentration and may explain some of the differences with published\nfindings. The analysis of herbage taken from individual cuts showed low K\nconcentrations (0.7%) all through the season in K0 whereas in K65 there was a\ndecline in K% with cut 3 reaching 1% (Table 3). The similar low herbage K\nconcentrations in K0 in all three cuts (Table 3) indicated that K probably was the\ngrowth limiting factor all through the season and thus 'testing' the systems limits in\nterms of K releasecapacity.\n\u00d8gaard et al. (2002) studied the effects of K-fertiliser application rates in\ngrass herbage trials (dominated by timothy, _Phleum pratense_ L., and meadow\nfescue, _Festuca pratensis_ L.), and found that on sandy soils low in K there was a\npositive yield response on addition of K fertiliser the second and third year where\ngrass K concentrations were 1.0-1.4%. Exhaustive cropping with perennial\nryegrass ( _Lolium perenne_ L.) in a pot experiment, demonstrated that at\nconcentrations of 0.6-0.8% K (Ghorayshi and Lotse 1986) growth essentially\nceased. In long-term fertility trials (40 years) Andersson et al. (2007) found no\nyield reduction and maintained grass/clover herbage K concentration of ~2% in K\nnil plots on silty clay and clay soils. However, on sandy loam and loam soils\nherbage concentrations were generally less than 2% K, and, although it came\ndown to 1% in one case, no effects on yield were recorded. The studied plots were\nfertilised with N but not P or K, and possibly P had become the limiting element\nprior to K in these systems, not 'pushing' the K delivering capacity as hard as in the\nexperimentdescribed herein.\n\n\n\n454 455\n\n\nPlant availablesoil K\n\n\n\nAnnual K off-take and soil K pools\n\n\n\nExchangeable and soil solution K have often been considered readily available for\nplants (e.g., Sparks 1987), while fixed and structural K are less available (e.g., Pal\net al. 1999). The exchangeable K pool, usually extracted by ammonium acetate,\nammonium lactate, ammonium nitrate, acetic acid or similar, as used in soil tests\nfor fertiliser recommendations (e.g., Egn\u00e9r et al. 1960; Thomas 1982; Rowell\n1994; MISR/SAC 1985; MAFF, 1986), were replenished about 10 times during\nthe 30 year experiment (Tables 6 and 9), suggesting a lack of sensitivity in this\nmeasurement to reflect actual plant availability of soil K. This indicated that\nsubstantial amounts of \u201cnon-exchangeable\u201d K had been released during the\nexperimental period and made available for plant uptake. In fact, several\nstudies have shown that release of fixed or structural K can contribute significantly\nto plant supply (e.g., Sinclair 1979a; 1979b; Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007;\nSimonsson et al. 2007) and thus calling for a new approach to 'plant available K'.\nThe demand for sustainable use of natural resources, including K fertiliser raw\nmaterial (mined KCl and K\ufffdSO\ufffd) that has a rather limited distribution globally 2 4\n(regions such as Africa, Asia and Oceania have to rely on import) and rapidly\nincreasing prices of agricultural inputs are also pertinent in this regard (e.g.\nManning 2010).\nIn a K depleted soil the exchangeable K (i.e. Ac-K) concentration by the end\nof the growing season indicates a soil specific property to bind and release K; and\nwhereas in certain soil types the release rate of K is slow and will restrict yields\nmarkedly in other parent materials it will meet all crop needs (McLean andWatson\n1985). After some initial years, Ac-K in Grass I was on average 39 mg kg, -1\nwhereas in Grass II it was 28 mg kg (Fig. 2). The lower Ac-K in the autumn in -1\nGrass II might be due to the fact that three cuts were taken while in Grass I the grass\nwas cut only twice a year. This can be compared with the results of a pot\nexperiment with intensive rye grass cropping to reach K exhaustion on soils from\nthe same soil association (Sinclair 1979a) where the exchangeable K (average for\ntwo course textured granitic soils of the CountesswellsAssociation) was 34 mg kg \n1 when the soil was partly depleted (after 6-8 cuts, low yield level) and 26 mg kg in -1\n\nthe more depleted soil (after 9-12 cuts, growth virtually ceased). The similarity\nbetween the results from the field experiment and the pot trial indicates that the K\nrelease rate has been governed by the parent material of the soil and the plant-soil\nsystem. This includes a combination of soil mineralogy, particle size (or rather\nspecific surface area), rooting depth and density, efficiency in K uptake, etc., all\nfactors determining the soil solution K concentration and thus controlling the\ndiffusion of K e.g. from interlayer positions of micas (e.g. Newman, 1969;\nFanning et al 1989).\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1,\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 4\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the accumulated total K net-deficit was about 1100 kg K ha, i.e. on\naverage 35 kg K ha yr and the question arises as to how this can be related to -1 -1,\ndifferent K sources.TheTot-K soil concentrationswere rather high, 23-28 g K kg, -1\nas compared to 5-40 g K kg recorded in a range of Scottish agricultural soils -1\n(Andrist-Rangel et al. 2010) and 0.4-30 g K kg reported as a typical range in -1\nmineral soils globally (Sparks 1987). Thus the Tot-Kpool in the rooting zone was\nvery large (72 000 kg K ha ) indicating that the soil was very rich in mineral bound -1\nK.The chemically definedAq-K pool (0-40 cm) was 12 000 kg ha, which equated -1\nto 17% of the Tot-K. That can be compared to a study of Scottish grassland soils\nshowing an average extractability of 13% (9-17%, n=3) for similar soils\n(CountesswellsAssociation) (Andrist-Rangel et al. 2010).\nHowever, the type of K bearing minerals influence the potential rate of release\nthrough mineral weathering and thus plant supply. Of the K bearing minerals that\nwere identified in the soil, biotite is the one most prone to release K followed by\nhydrobiotite (e.g. Thompson and Ukrainczyk 2002). The estimated K pool in\nterms of these minerals showed that by the end of the 30 year period the rooting\nzone contained 8 000 kg K ha in the form of biotite and hydrobiotite. Assuming -1\nthat the C horizon is representative of the material the soil was derived from there\nwas originally 13 600 kg ha K in biotite and hydrobiotite (Table 8). Comparing -1\nthat to the present situation, the difference is 5600 kg K, which can be seen in\nrelation to the K off-take of 1100 kg during the last 30 years. A hypothetic\ncalculation of continued intensive grass production, with no or low K fertiliser\napplication and an annual net K off-take of 35 kg, would completely deplete the K\npresent in trioctahedral micas in a bit more than two centuries. Taking the relative\nroot distribution into account showing that most roots were in the top 25 cm the\n(84%, Table 1), where the K pool in biotite and hydrobiotite was 4100 kg K ha -1\n(Table 8), and applying the release (net-off take) rate of 35 kg K ha yr the K- -1 -1\nbiotite and -hydrobiotite pool would last for another 120 or 140 years assuming 84\nand 100% uptake from this soil layer.\nAlthough these are very rough estimates, the findings can be related to\nlaboratory studies of release mechanisms of interlayer K in micas. Newman\n(1969) found that micas release interlayer K by cation exchange and diffusion, a\nprocess that is governed by low solution concentration of K. The dioctahedral\nmicas were found to be less reactive than trioctahedral micas and thus required a\nconsiderable (two orders of magnitude) lower solution concentration of K to\nrelease interlayer K. The study by Newman (1969) also showed that the release\nrate of K was largely independent of the proportion of mica K being exchanged.\nApplying this conceptually to the results of the present study, it seems most likely\nthat the K delivering capacity in the experimental soil is regulated by grass uptake\n\n\n\n1 -1\n\n\n\n456 457\n\n\nof K from the soil solution and hence the release rate of interlayer K in\ntrioctahedral (biotite and hydrobiotite) micas, and that the release rate might\nremain at a similar level until most biotite and hydrobiotite is K depleted and\nthereafter change (decrease) drastically when dioctahedral micas (and K\nfeldspars) becomethe main K source for plants.\n\n\nEstimationof K releasefrom soil resources\n\n\n\nSimonsson et al. (2007) found that when receiving no K (or P, but N) for 40 years, a\nloamy sand soil released 8 \u00b1 10 kg K ha yr, whereas four other soils (sandy loams -1 -1\nto clays) had been releasing 40\u00b18, 45\u00b110, 51\u00b112, and 65\u00b17 kg K ha yr during the -1 -1\nsame period of time. This can be compared with the 35 kg K ha yr on average -1 -1\ntaken out from the loamy sand in this study.Asimplified view has been that the soil\nK release and fixation capacity is mainly related to soil texture, particularly the\nfine textured material. However, that is not fully supported by this study, or other\nrecent field studies (e.g., Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007; Murashkina et al. 2007),\nwhich have shown the importance of the mineralogical composition of coarser\nfractions, in particular the occurrence of biotite and hydrobiotite in the silt\nfraction. The main difference between the loamy sand in this study as compared to\nthe one studied by Simonsson et al. (2007) was the mineralogy and in particular the\npresence of biotite and hydrobiotite, in total accounting for 4-8% of the minerals in\nthe former but only 1-2% in the latter (Andrist-Rangel, 2008). Other differences\nwere numbers of years with grass or grass/clover herbage in relation to cereal\ncrops and the climate.\nIn order to predict the K weathering potential of different soils, soil\nmineralogy and other soil properties, cropping systems, management practices,\nclimate etc have to be taken into account and a modelling approach would be\nneeded. Some first attempts to apply the biogeochemical steady-state model\nPROFILE on some northern European agricultural soils were carried out by\nHolmquist et al (2003) who estimated K weathering rates of between 3 and 82 kg\nha yr . A comparison between K release estimates from net off-take based on -1 -1\nmass balance calculations (Table 9) and modelled weathering rates for the studied\nCountesswells soil showed, however, a large discrepancy between field based\nestimates and model predictions, 35 versus 5 (uncertainty range 2-16) kg K ha yr -1 -1\n(Holmquist et al. 2003). This difference is most likely related to a combination of\nfactors that include the small clay content and specific surface area of the soil,\nparameters that the PROFILE model is very sensitive to (e.g. Hodson et al. 1997).\nThere is also an issue as to how the weathering of micas is represented within the\nmodel in terms of chemical reactions (Warfvinge and Sverdrup 1992; Sverdrup\nand Warfvinge 1993) because diffusion controlled exchange of interlayer K might\nbe expected to be the dominant process in agricultural soils maintained at near\n\n\n\nneutralpH values (e.g. Fanning et al. 1989).\nAs mentioned earlier, there are orders of magnitude differences in critical K\nsolution activity between di- and tri-octahedral micas (Newman, 1969; Fanning et\nal. 1989), i.e. in soils with tri-octahedral micas (such as biotite) they will become\nthe main K source for plant supply in K depleted/low input systems. When\ninterlayer K in biotite has been released and dioctahedral mica (and/or K feldspar)\nbecomes the major K source the release rate will most probably decrease\nconsiderably since much lower solution concentrations of K are required for\ndiffusion. This means that the release of K from soil resources observed in this and\n\nother long-term experiments will not be constant over time or related to the total K\npool but very dependent on the types and amount of K bearing minerals, in\nparticularthe presence of tri-octahedralmicas.\nThe long-term field data obtained from this study in combination with the\nquantitative mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of the soil and data\nfrom the literature (e.g. controlled laboratory experiments) have demonstrated the\npotential and need for further developing an approach linking mechanistic and\nquantitative assessment of plant K uptake and release from mineral sources in\nagricultural systems including predictions of K weathering rates. The increasing\nprices of agricultural inputs such as fertilisers and the increasing awareness of\nlimited availability and uneven distribution of non-renewable resources\n(including soils) are reinforcing a better knowledge, use and management of sitespecific resources for developing and maintaining sustainable production systems\nwhich requires cross-disciplinary research linking up basic and applied sciences\nwithin biogeochemistryand agriculturalsciences.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\nThis study has shown that K became the growth limiting nutrient element all\nthrough the growing season 'pushing' the K release capacity of the soil. The plant\n(perennial rye grass) K concentration was lower (0.6-0.7%) than reported in most\nprevious field studies. The relation between the average annual K net-off take (35\nkg ha ) and the quantified exchangeable K pool (~ 100 kg ha ), often assumed to -1 -1\nrepresent 'plant available' K, illustrated that 'non-exchangeable' K had been\ncontinually released and made available for plant uptake. Hence, the perception of\n'plant available K' needs to be reassessed taking the dynamics of the soil K\nresource(s) into account. The accumulated net K off-take (1 100 kg ha during 30 -1\nyear) was higher than previously reported from coarse texture soils derived from\ngranitic parent material. The relatively high concentration of trioctahedral micas,\ni.e. biotite and hydrobiotite, was most probable the main K source. However,\nassuming a continued low input management system with similar net K off-take\nthese easily weatherable minerals would be depleted of K within two centuries,\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n458 459\n\n\nsomethingthat needs to be considered in land-use and nutrientmanagement.\nThe study illustrates the strength of combining long-term field experimental\ndata with state of the art quantitative mineralogical methods in order to assess sitespecific resources which can form a basis to evaluate the sustainability of different\nmanagement practices. It shows how long-term field experimental data can be\nutilized to obtain quantitative measures on the potential K release in low input\nsystems in different soil environments in order to better interpret K input/output\nfield mass balances, predict the long-term sustainability of different farming\npractices, and suggest possible land-use and management options. Including an\nintegrated modelling approach would be an important component to come further\nin research and implementation within this area. The increasing prices of\nagricultural inputs such as K fertilisers and the increasing awareness of limited\navailability of non-renewable resources are reinforcing a better knowledge and\nuse of site-specific resources for developing and maintaining sustainable\nproductionsystems.\n\n\n**Acknowledgements** JAM Ross, D Nelson and Y Cook for field and laboratory\n\nassistance.The long-term funding from Scottish Government Rural, Environment\nand ResearchAnalysis Department(RERAD) is acknowledged.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAdamo P, McHardy WJ, Edwards AC (1998) SEM observations in the backscattered mode of the soil-root zone of _Brassica napus_ (cv.

Fertilizer nutrients have played a major role in\nimproving crop productivity. During the period 1969-2008, food grain production\nmore than doubled from about 98 mt to a record 230 mt in 2007-08, while fertilizer\nnutrient use increased by nearly 12 times from 1.95 mt to more than 23 mt in 200708 (Rao 2009). Notwithstanding these impressive developments, food grain\n\n\nTSatyanarayana\nInternational Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), South India Programme, Flat No. 401,\nTejaswini Arcade, West Maredpally, Secunderabad \u2013 500 003 (Andhra Pradesh) India,\ne-mail:tsatya@ipni.net,\nRKTewatia\n\nThe Fertiliser Association of India, FAI House, 10 Shaheed Jit Singh Marg, New Delhi \u2013\n110 067 India\n\n\n466 467\n\n\n-1 which may aggravatein the coming years and need attention.\nIn India, state wise approaches to crop nutrient balances have been developed\nway back in 2001 considering the nutrient additions and removal data either from\n1998-99 or 1999-2000. Since then, the information on nutrient balances has not\nbeen updated. Furthermore, for making future estimations, information on current\nnutrient balances is highly essential. Therefore an attempt has been made in this\npaper to generate fresh information on nutrient balances in major agriculturally\nimportant states of India considering the recent statistics of nutrient additions and\nremovals as available from FAI (2008). Nutrient balance calculations in most of\nthe cases do not give real picture as they consider nutrient removal by crops and\naddition through fertilizers neglecting contribution from sources other than\nfertilizers such as organic manures, crop residues and stubbles, irrigation water\netc. However, in this paper, the authors have tried to overcome that limitation by\nconsidering nutrient additions through organic sources wherever possible from\nthe information available in the published literature. While calculating nutrient\nremoval by crops at the present production levels, emphasis has been made to\nconsider removal of nutrients by fruits and vegetables in all the states; tea, coffee,\njute, rubber and other plantation crops in states wherever applicable and the total\nproduction values have been multiplied with the nutrient uptake per tonne of\nproduce and arrived at removal figures. During the discussions on nutrient\nbalances in individual states, efforts have been made to compare the current\nscenarios with that of either 1998-99 or 1999-2000, the reason being the last\nnutrient balance studies were generated from the statistics of those years.\nEfficiencyfactors were involvedfor calculatingnet nutrientbalances.\n\n\n\ndemand is estimated to increase to about 300 mt yr by 2025 for which the country\nwould require 45 mt of nutrients (ICAR 2008). With almost no opportunity to\nincrease the area under cultivation over 142 m ha, much of the desired increase in\nfood grain production has to be attained through yield enhancement in per unit\narea productivity. To sustain production demands, the productivity of major crops\nhas to increase annually by 3.0 to 7.5 percent (NAAS 2006). Much of this has to be\nmet by increasing genetic potential and improved production efficiency of the\nresources and inputs like water and nutrients. In addition, the growing concern\nabout poor soil health and declining factor productivity or nutrient use efficiency\nhas raised concern on the productive capacity of agricultural systems in India.\nMajor factors contributing to the low and declining crop responses to fertilizer\nnutrients are (a) continuous nutrient mining due to imbalanced nutrient use, which\nis leading to depletion of some of the major, secondary, and micro nutrients like P,\nK, S, Zn, Mn, Fe and B, and (b) mismanagement of irrigation systems leading to\nserious soil quality degradation. Furthermore, such low efficiency of resources\nand fertilizer inputs has impacted the production costs with serious environmental\n\nconsequences.\nIntensive agriculture is continuously being practiced in most of the states of\nIndia and therefore, the problems of soil fertility exhaustion and nutrient\nimbalances are bound to occur. The ill effects of exhaustive cropping systems are\nreflected on production of succeeding crops. In order to maintain the optimum\nlevel of production, it is necessary to know the nutrient requirement of crops,\nfertility status of the soil and the amount of nutrient removal from the soil by crops.\nDuring 1999-2000, the crop removal of nutrients is estimated to be about 28 mt\nwhile the fertilizer consumption was only 18 mt with an annual nutrient gap of 10\nmt. Although a part of this nutrient gap is expected to be bridged from nonchemical sources like organic manures and biological processes, still there is a\ndistinct gap in nutrient removal and supply leading to nutrient mining from the\nnative soil posing a serious threat to long term sustainability of crop production\n(Hegde and Sudhakarbabu 2001). Furthermore, the country like India can hope to\nachieve and sustain the desired level of agricultural production in the long run only\nif we can bridge the gap between nutrient removal and addition. Therefore,\nunderstanding the present status of plant nutrient use and removal and the resultant\nnutrient balances in different states of the country with varied agro climatic\nconditions would enable us for undertaking the corrective measures to bridge the\nnutrient gap and help to maintain soil health and ensure the food and nutritional\nsecurity. Information on nutrient balances would also help in developing an\nunderstanding about the annual loss of nutrients from the soil and to devise\nnutrient management strategies for rational use of soil resource in sustainable\nmanner. It also gives insights into the level of fertilizer use efficiency and the\nextent to which externally added nutrients have been absorbed by the crop and\nutilized for yield production. It can also forewarn about nutrient deficiencies,\n\n\n\n**Nutrient balance scenario in majorstates of eastern India**\n\n\nAssam\n\n\n\nAssam has 4 m ha of gross cropped area of which 14.5 percent is irrigated. Major\nportion of the soils of the state are Inceptisols (49.3 percent), followed by Entisols\n(32.3 percent),Alfisols (12.3 percent) and Ultisols (6.1 percent).Amongst several\nsoil related constraints, high soil acidity especially in the uplands and transitional\nmedium lands limits nutrient availability to the crops. The principal crops grown\nare rice, jute, potato, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, sugarcane, fruits, tea etc and the\ncropping intensity of the state is around 145 percent. The share of area under food\ngrains to gross cropped area is 71 percent. A variety of cropping systems are in\npractice in the state. The current fertilizer use in the state is 57.3 kg ha consisting -1\n\n\n-1\n\nof 27.7, 14.6 and 15.0 kg ha N, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO respectively, the N:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO use 2 5 2 2 5 2\nratio being 1.8:0.9:1.0. The consumption of total fertilizer nutrients (N + P\ufffdO + 2 5\nK\ufffdO) during 2007-08 was 214 thousand ton. 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\n\n\n2 5\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n468 469\n\n\nNutrient balance scenario (Table 1) for the state ofAssam shows that the crop\nremoval being higher than that added, all the three NPK nutrients have a negative\nbalance. Nutrient mining is found to be to the tune of 0.113, 0.011 and 0.199 mt of\nN, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO, respectively. If the similar trend of mining of nutrient reserves is 2 5 2\nallowed to continue without replenishment, worsen situations would lead to\ndeterioration of soil health and decline in crop productivity. The soils of Assam\nbeing constrained with soil acidity, high phosphorus fixation, nutrient losses from\nsoil along with socio-economic problems, the state needs special attention on\nadequate application of plant nutrients in order to achieve targeted crop\nproduction. Integrated nutrient management, organic recycling and\n\n\n**Table 1** Nutrient additions, removal by crops and apparent balance in major\nstates of Eastern India\n\n\n\nAgriculture in Bihar is the only backbone to the overall development of state. It has\ntotal geographical area of 9.37 m ha. The net cropped area stands at 5.7 m ha, of\nwhich 61.1 percent is irrigated. About 89 percent of the total cropped area of the\nstate is under food grains and the current cropping intensity is 139.4 percent. The\nprincipal crops grown are rice, wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, and\nsugarcane along with large acreage under fruits.The state is divided into four agroclimatic regions. Three major soil groups are recognized as foothill soils in the\nnarrow strips of northern boundary, sedentary foot hill and forest soils in the\nsouthern boundary and remaining soils are dominantly of alluvial origin in the\nIndo-Gangetic plains. The current fertilizer use in the state is 162.8 kg ha -1\n\n\n-1\n\nconsisting of 125.5, 25.9 and 11.4 kg ha N, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO respectively, the 2 5 2\nN:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO use ratio being 9.9:2.2:1.0. While most of the nitrogen, phosphorus 2 5 2\nand potassium are applied through urea, DAP (46 percent P\ufffdO\ufffd) and MOP (60 2 5\npercent K\ufffdO) respectively, a healthy share of complex fertilizers also contributes 2\nto the totalNPK consumptionin the state.\nThe total NPK removal by selected crops appears to be 1.30 mt as against the\nfertilizer nutrient addition of 1.21 mt. Thus, a net NPK depletion of 0.09 mt was\nrecorded for the whole state (Table 1). The balance sheet indicates that the\nmaximum removal was recorded with K followed by N and P. Potassium balance\nin the state is negative and this is very much expected under the situations when the\npotash removals by crops is much larger than its addition through fertilizers and\nother sources. The nutrient use pattern in Bihar is confined to N and P and the K\nfertilization is by and large neglected in most of the cases. Due to intensive\ncultivation, sulphur and micronutrients like Zn and B are also getting severely\ndepleted from the soil. There is a need to exploit the prevailing practices of\nmanuring and residue recycling, which are not satisfactory at the present level of\ncultivation. Integrated plant nutrient supply system seems to have a long way to go\nfor maintainingsoil healthand sustaining yield in the state.\n\n\n\nsupplementary nutrient addition are the keys to uphold productivity at high and\nsustained level.\n\n\nBihar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n2 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJharkhand\n\n\nJharkhand has an area of 7.95 m ha and a population of 21.8 million.

In Punjab, 95 percent of the gross cropped area is irrigated with\ncropping intensity of 194 percent. Major soils of the state are alluvial in nature.\nThe principal crops grown are rice, wheat, maize, cotton, sugarcane, mustard,\nchickpea, and potato. The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is\n77 percent. The total nutrient consumption in the state increased by 23.5 percent,\nfrom 1.38 mt during 1998-99 to 1.69 mt during 2007-08. The intensity of nutrients\n\n\n-1\n\n(N + P\ufffdO + K\ufffdO) use in Punjab is 210 kg ha consisting of 162.7 kg N, 42.5 kg P\ufffdO 2 5 2 2 5\nand 4.7 kg K\ufffdO with N:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO use ratio of 34.3:9.0:1 which evidently is highly 2 2 5 2\nunbalanced.Apparently, the share of potash in totalNPK use in the Stateis only 2.3\npercent,which is negligible.\nNutrient addition to crops is mainly through mineral fertilizers and the\ncontribution of organic sources is marginal in the state. It is evident from Table 2\nthat the N balance in the state is positive at 565 thousand tonnes. However, with the\ncurrent additions of 344 thousand tonnes of P\ufffdO as against 446 thousand tonnes of 2 5\ncrop removal, the P balance in the state is negative by 102 thousand tonnes. The\nuse of K in Punjab is almost negligible, whereas its removal is 36 and 129 percent\ngreater than that of N and P. The total K removal by the crops at current level of\nproductivity is 1.022 mt against total addition of 0.038 mt with the negative K\nbalance of 0.985 mt. (Brar 2004) reported that total K loss from Punjab soils\nincreased from 159 thousand tonnes in 1960-61 to 678 thousand tonnes by 200203. This wide gap in potash removal and addition has impoverished soil's potash\nreserves and thus the magnitude and extent of its deficiency and crop responses to\nits application are on increase in both time and space. Sulphur deficiency is\npredominantly seen in the state, limiting the yields of oilseeds, pulses and cereals.\nCurrent status of S balance is negative with mining of about 80 thousand tonnes\nannually in the state (Aulakh and Bahl 2001). Amount of Zn added was several\ntimes higher than its removal and as a result substantial amount of Zn was left in\nthe balance owing to its poor utilization. There is a need to implement the 4 R's\nstrategy of nutrient management focusing right quantity of nutrients through right\nsource at right time by right methods of application, which would help in bridging\nthe nutrientgaps in the state.\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 5 2 2 5\n\n\n\n2 2 5 2\n\n\n\n2 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|State|Nutrients (000 t)|Col3|Col4|Mining<br>Index<br>(R/A)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|State|~~Additions~~<br>(A)|~~Removal~~<br>(R)|~~Balance~~|~~Balance~~|\n|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|Uttar Pradesh (a*)|\n|N<br>P O<br>K O<br>NPK Total<br>2<br>5<br>2|3180.7<br>1023.6<br>863.1<br>5067.4|1488.3<br>591.8<br>1842.1<br>3922.2|1692.4<br>431.8<br>-979.0<br>1145.2|0.5<br>0.6<br>2.1<br>3.2|\n|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|Punjab (b*)|\n|N<br>P O<br>K O<br>NPK Total<br>2<br>5<br>2|1315.5<br>343.9<br>38.4<br>1697.8|750.2<br>446.3<br>1022.8<br>2219.3|565.2<br>-102.4<br>-984.5<br>-521.6|0.6<br>1.3<br>26.7<br>28.5|\n|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|Haryana (c*)|\n|N<br>P O<br>K O<br>NPK Total<br>2<br>5<br>2|520.6<br>65.1<br>16.6<br>602.3|489.8<br>220.3<br>669.1<br>1379.2|30.8<br>-155.2<br>-652.5<br>-776.9|0.9<br>3.4<br>40.4<br>44.7|\n\n\na*\ufffdInputs\ufffdthrough\ufffdfertilizers,\ufffdirrigation\ufffdwater,\ufffdcrop\ufffdresidues\ufffdand\ufffdFYM\ufffdconsidered\nb*\ufffdInputs\ufffdthrough\ufffdfertilizer\ufffdadditions,\ufffdcontribution\ufffdfrom\ufffdother\ufffdsources\ufffdconsidered\ufffdnegligible\nc* Additions\ufffdthrough\ufffdfertilizers,\ufffd1/3rd\ufffdcontribution\ufffdof\ufffdnutrients\ufffdfrom\ufffdcow\ufffddung\ufffdand\ufffdefficiency\ufffdfactors\nof\ufffd0.55,\ufffd0.25\ufffdand\ufffd0.66\ufffdwere\ufffdconsidered\ufffdfor\ufffdNPK\n\n\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n\nUttar Pradesh is one of the agriculturally important states of Northern India with\n\n\n\n474 475\n\n\n17.6 m ha of gross cropped area, of which 72 percent is irrigated with cropping\nintensity of 152 percent.

The total -1 -1\nnutrient consumption increased from 1.27 mt during 1999-00 to 1.51mt during\n2007-08 and registered an increase of 19 percent in the consumption of total\nnutrients over the last eight years. The state with 6.5 percent of the country's gross\ncropped area has 6.7 percent of total fertilizer nutrients consumed in the country,\nwhich has come down from 1999-2000 levels of 7.6 percent. The consumption of\nN and K\ufffdO at 0.79 and 0.33 mt during 2007-08, registered an increase of 16.2 2\npercent and 52.8 percent, respectively, over 1999-2000, and the consumption of\nP\ufffdO at 0.387 mt recorded a slight increase of 1.3 percent during the period. NPK 2 5\nuse ratio changed from 3.2:1.7:1 to 2.4:1.2:1 during the period.\nThe current nutrient addition through fertilizers was worked out from FAI\n(2008), which reveals that about 1.51 mt of nutrients were consumed against total\nremoval of 1.6 mt of nutrient by different major crops grown in the state resulting\nin a negative nutrient balance of 0.092 mt of NPK that is not met through fertilizer\napplications for the crop year 2007-08 (Table 3). However, considering the\nnutrient availability of about 0.55 mt (Hegde and Surendrababu 2001) through\ndifferent organic sources in the state, the negative balance of 0.92 lakh tonnes of\nnutrients could be considered negligible.

The fertilizer nutrient consumption in the state decreased marginally by 5\npercent from 0.219 mt during 1998-99 to 0.208 mt during 2007-08 and as a result,\nthe agricultural productivity of the state showed a continuous decline in recent\nyears. While, the consumption of N at 0.093 mt, registered an increase of 7.27\npercent during 2007-08 over 1998-99, the consumption of P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO at 42.7 2 5 2\nand 72.3 thousand ton, recorded a decline of 3.4 percent and 17.2 percent,\nrespectively, during the period. Present NPK use ratio of the state is 1.3:0.5 :1. The\nper hectare consumption of total fertilizer nutrients is 70 kg and is far below the\nnationalaverageof 117 kg ha . -1\nFrom the nutrient balance sheet of Kerala (Table 3), it is quite obvious that the\nfertilizer usage in the state is not adequate to meet the demand for crop removal.\nOut of the potential demand of 0.541 mt of fertilizer nutrients, only 0.21 mt is\nadded through fertilizers during 2007-08 and as a result, there is a net negative\nbalance of 0.332 mt, which is to be supplied through additional nutrient inputs in\norder to overcome excess nutrient mining form the soil. The total K removal by\nmajor crops is reported to be 0.279 mt against total addition of 0.072 mt K through\nfertilizers with a negative potassium balance of 0.206 mt and in consequence the K\nreserve of the soils of the state has depleted. In addition to this, the micronutrient\ndeficiencies are also becoming widespread at an alarming rate (John et al. 2001).\nFor attaining a sustainable crop production from the state and cater to the needs of\nthe ever growing population, there is a need to create awareness among farmers\nabout the responsible management of plant nutrients through balanced and\nintegratednutrientmanagementstrategies.\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n2 5\n\n\n\nTamilNadu\n\n\nTamil Nadu has 3.4 percent of India's gross cropped area with about 4.8 percent of\nthe total fertilizer consumption of the country.

The NPK use ratio in the state during 2007-08 is\n2.0:0.7:1.\n\nThe crop nutrient balance of the state generated as per the information given\nin FAI (2008) reveals that the nutrient additions of nitrogen (0.543 mt) is slightly\nhigher than the removal (0.495 mt), resulting in a positive balance of about 0.049\nmt (Table 3). With regard to P nutrition, the removal is slightly higher by 2800\ntonnes over the Paddition through fertilizers and the resulted net negative balance\nis quite manageable in the state. However, the balances pertaining to K nutrition\nwas significantly negative.About 0.73 mt of K was removed as against an addition\nof 0.304 mt and resulted in an alarming negative balance of 0.421 mt. With\nintensive cultivation at a higher stake in the state, this alarming situation would\nresult in depletion of native K reserves of soils and therefore demands attention of\nscientists, extension workers and policy makers for taking up appropriate K\nadditionsthrough mineralfertilizersand other availablesources.\n\n\n**Nutrient balance scenario in majorstates of western India**\n\n\nGujarat\n\n\n\n**Table 4** Nutrient additions, removal by crops and apparent balance in major states of\nWestern India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGujarat having 10.69 million hectares of gross cropped area (31.5 percent\nirrigated) with cropping intensity of 113 percent is one of the agriculturally\nimportant states of Western India.

The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is 60 percent.\nThe consumption of total fertilizer nutrients in the state increased from 0.99 mt\nduring 1998-99 to 1.3 mt during 2007-08, representing a growth of 31.3 percent,\nduring the last ten years. The consumption of all the three nutrients recorded\npositive growth. N, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO at 0.796, 0.43 and 0.076 mt during 2007-08, 2 5 2\nregistered an increase of 38, 12.4 and 183 percent, respectively over 1998-99\nlevels. The current fertilizer use in the state is only 66.4 kg ha consisting of 40.6, -1\n\n\n-1\n\n21.9 and 3.9 kg ha N, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO respectively, the N:P\ufffdO\ufffd:K\ufffdO use ratio being 2 5 2 2 5 2\n10.5 : 5.7 : 1.0.The share of potash in totalNPK use in the state is 5.8 percent.\nThe total removal of N during 2007-08 was 1.053 mt, with the addition\nthrough fertilizers and organic manures of 0.934 mt (Table 4). Therefore, the N\nbalance in the state seems to be negative (0.119 mt) at present level of crop\nproduction. P was positively balanced at 0.085 mt, however, the K balance was\nextremely negative. The total K removal by major crops at current level of\nproductivity is 0.944 mt against total addition of 0.169 mt through fertilizers and\norganic manures showing a negative balance of 0.775 mt. This wide gap in K\nremoval and addition has impoverished soil's K reserves and thus the magnitude\nand extent of its deficiency and crop responses to its application are on increase in\nboth time and space.The total negative balance of NPK in the state is amounting to\n0.808 mt. Apart from considering nutrient contributions from organic manures,\nthere are considerable quantities of crop residues, forest litters, press mud, poultry\nmanure, biofertilisers etc are also available in the state. Therefore, there is a need\nfor the development of strategies for recycling of available crop residues in order\nto fulfillthe existingnutrientgap.\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\n\n\n0.175 mt (Table 4). P removal by crops was 0.684 mt and additions through\nfertilizers was 0.642 mt showing a negative balance of .042 mt.This shows that the\nP use in Maharashtra was below the recommended levels of application and\ntherefore there is a need to increase Papplication.There is a wide gap in addition of\nK to soil and their removal by crops.Although about 0.421 mt of K was added, the\nremoval was very high at 1.483 mt, leaving a negative balance of 1.062 mt of K.\nReplenishment of S and other micronutrients is almost negligible and widespread\nmulti nutrient deficiencies have been reported in the state (Patil et al. 2001).\nTherefore, there is a need to improve additions of deficient nutrients in the low\nconsuming areas along with use of organic manures and encouraging retention of\ncrop residues in soil.\n\n\nRajasthan\n\n\n\n_etc_\n\n\n\n-1 -1\n\n\n\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\n\n\nMaharashtra\n\n\n\nth\n\n\n\nMaharashtra, the third largest Indian state occupying 1/10 of the area of the\ncountry enjoys varied agro-climatic situations. Black soils with swell-shrink\ncharacteristics dominate the soil type along with lateritic, coastal alluvial, saline\nalkali, mixed red and black soils. The consumption of total fertilizer nutrients\nrecorded an impressive growth of 11.3 percent during 2007-08. Total nutrient\nconsumption increased from 1.46 mt during 1998-99 to 2.33 mt during 2007-08.\nAll the three nutrients recorded positive growth during the period. The\nconsumption of N, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO at 1.264, 0.642 and 0.421 mt, recorded an 2 5 2\nincrease of 45.3, 62.5 and 113.7 percent, respectively, during 2007-08 over 199899. The present NPK use ratio was 3.0:1.5:1 and consumption of total fertilizer\nnutrientsin the state during 2007-08 was 103 kg ha . -1\nRemoval of N during 2007-08 was 1.088 mt, and addition through fertilizers\nwas 1.264 mt, therefore the N balance in the soils of Maharashtra was positive by\n\n\n\nRajasthan having 19.23 m ha of gross cropped area (31 percent irrigated) is one of\nthe agriculturally important states of Western India. The state is endowed with a\nlarge diversity in soils from dune and associated soils to medium black soils. The\nprincipal crops grown are pearl millet, maize, coarse millets, pulses, oilseeds,\ncotton, vegetables _etc_ . The share of area under food grains to gross cropped area is\n59 percent. A variety of cropping systems are in practice in the state. The current\nfertilizer use in the state is only 45.5 kg ha consisting of 32.5, 12.0 and 1.0 kg ha -1 -1\nN, P\ufffdO and K\ufffdO respectively, the N: P\ufffdO : K\ufffdO use ratio being 57.4:16.9:1.0. The 2 5 2 2 5 2\nshare of potash to total NPK consumption is only 2.3 percent. The total K removal\nby major crops is reported to be 1.015 mt against total addition of 0.021 mt K\nthrough fertilizers showing negative balance of 0.994 mt and in consequence the K\nreserve of the soils of the state is continuously depleting.\nBased on the nutrients absorbed by the crops and nutrients added through\nfertilizers, the balance sheet shows negative trend for all the three NPK nutrients\n(Table 4). There is a requirement of about 0.12, 0.11 and 0.99 mt of additional NPK\nnutrients to bridge the deficit in the state. Gupta (2001) reported that K mining in\nRajasthan is highest followed by N, S, P and Zn. The negative nutrient balance in\nthe state could be bridged through adequate use of fertilizers. There is a need to\ndouble the present levels of nutrient consumption through additional fertilizer use\nand also by supplying nutrientsthrough cattlemanure and other organic sources.\n\n\n\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nFrom the foregoing discussions, it is conspicuous that the nutrient use pattern in\nmajority of the agriculturally important states of India is inadequate and mostly\ndominated by NPfertilization. The negative balance of K is highly predominant in\nalmost all the states, which imply that the use of K fertilizers is neglected in most\n\n\n\n482 483\n\n\ncases. K additions through the prevailing practices of manuring and residue\nrecycling, as well as the meager inputs through K fertilizers are not sufficient to\nmatch the K removal by different crops and therefore, tremendous efforts are\nneeded to promote K consumption through use of K rich fertilizers. The current\ntrends of nutrient balances reveals that the gap between nutrient use and supply in\nfarming areas will continue to grow wide on account of intensive cropping and\ntherefore, there is a need to ensure proper and timely supply of major as well as\nsecondary and micronutrients. Other than additions through fertilizer nutrients,\npractices like recycling of crop residues instead of taking back the residues away\nfrom the field and use of animal manures through appropriate composting\nprocesses should be encouraged than diverting the resources for fuel and other\nsecondary purposes.\nNutrient balance calculations, sometimes, do not give the real picture as they\nconsider nutrient removal by crops and addition through fertilizers neglecting\ncontribution from sources other than fertilizers such as organic manures, crop\nresidues and stubbles, irrigation water etc. Therefore, contribution of nutrients\nfrom the available sources should be taken into account while making calculations\nto the maximum extent possible. Further, if the average use efficiency of fertilizers\n(N 50-60 percent; P 15-25 percent, K 60-70 percent) is taken into account, the\nnutrient additions through fertilizers is much more reduced and therefore, the\nremoval exceeds the consumption and nutrient gap is widened. Nevertheless, the\nsituation is balanced by addition of the nutrients through biofertilisers, FYM,\ncompost, green manuring or addition of crop residues in the field. The\nconsumption data on secondary and micronutrient fertilizers are not available.\nThere is a need to compute nutrient balances with respect to secondary and\nmicronutrients, giving emphasis primarily to the most limiting nutrients like S, Zn\nand B.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAulakh\ufffdMS,\ufffdBahl\ufffdGS\ufffd(2001)\ufffdNutrient\ufffdmining\ufffdin\ufffdagro-climatic\ufffdzones\ufffdof\ufffdPunjab.\nFert\ufffdNews\ufffd46\ufffd(4):\ufffd47-61\nBrar MS (2004) Potassium mining and agricultural sustainability: Punjab\nScenario Fert News 49 (7): 51-55\nFAI (2008) Fertilizerstatistics.FertiliserAssociation of India, New Delhi\nGuptaAK (2001) Nutrient mining in agro-climatic zones of Rajasthan.

They allow for the calculation of indicators, such as the nutrient balance (surplus if positive or\ndeficit if negative) and nutrient use efficiency, that help to monitor agricultural productivity and sustainability\nacross the world. We present a global database of country-level budget estimates for nitrogen (N), phosphorus\n(P) and potassium (K) on cropland. The database, disseminated in FAOSTAT, is meant to provide a global\nreference, synthesizing and continuously updating the state of the art on this topic. The database covers 205\ncountries and territories, as well as regional and global aggregates, for the period from 1961 to 2020. Results\nhighlight the wide range in nutrient use and nutrient use efficiencies across geographic regions, nutrients, and\ntime. The average N balance on global cropland has remained fairly steady at about 50\u201355 kg ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] during\nthe past 15 years, despite increasing N inputs. Regional trends, however, show recent average N surpluses that\nrange from a low of about 10 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] in Africa to more than 90 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] in Asia. Encouragingly,\naverage global cropland N use efficiency decreased from about 59 % in 1961 to a low of 43 % in 1988, but it has\nrisen since then to a level of 55 %. Phosphorus deficits are mainly found in Africa, whereas potassium deficits\noccur in Africa and the Americas. This study introduces improvements over previous work in relation to the\nkey nutrient coefficients affecting nutrient budgets and nutrient use efficiency estimates, especially with respect\nto nutrient removal in crop products, manure nutrient content, atmospheric deposition and crop biological N\nfixation rates.

The nutrient balance\n(defined as the difference between nutrient inputs and productive outputs: termed a surplus if positive and a deficit if\nnegative) is an indicator of the excess or insufficient use of\nnutrients from fertilizers and other sources in crop production. Nutrient surpluses threaten environmental quality, particularly with regard to water and air quality, climate change,\nand biodiversity loss (Zhang et al., 2021; FAO, 2022b). On\nthe other hand, nutrient deficits or nutrient surpluses close to\nzero could indicate soil nutrient mining, potentially decreasing soil health over time. Imbalanced crop nutrition endangers the productivity and sustainability of agriculture. Comparable data on soil nutrient budgets and related indicators\nof nutrient use efficiency are therefore useful tools to assess\nand monitor agricultural performance and may support the\n2030 Sustainable Development Goals indicators (Tubiello\net al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; FAO, 2022b; Quan et al.,\n2021). Time series data showing temporal changes are essential to monitor progress toward nutrient-related goals (Zhang\net al., 2021). Some nutrient budget time series with a global\nscope have been published; however, to the authors knowledge, they have been heavily biased toward N (Zhang et al.,\n2015; Conant et al., 2013; Lassaletta et al., 2014; Mueller et\nal., 2012; Bouwman et al., 2017; FAO, 2021; Bodirsky et al.,\n2012; Bouwman et al., 2013; Lassaletta et al., 2016; Lu and\nTian, 2017; Nishina et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017), few have\nbeen published for P and no time series has been published\nfor K, meaning that no studies or datasets have integrated all\nthree nutrients into a long-term nutrient budget database.\nData presented in this work focus on _partial_ nutrient budgets (referred to herein as nutrient budgets) and related nutrient use efficiencies on cropland. The term \u201cpartial\u201d is used\nhere to indicate that what is computed herein is in fact a partial nutrient budget in which specific nutrient losses such as\ngaseous emissions, leaching or runoff are not explicitly accounted for. In other words, such losses are embedded in\nthe overall nutrient budget estimates, whereas a \u201ccomplete\u201d\nnutrient budget would explicitly include specific estimates\nof the different losses. Cropland is the sum of arable land\nand permanent crops, including areas left fallow or cultivated\nwith temporary pastures within crop rotations but excluding permanent meadows and pastures (FAO, 2022d). We see\ntwo main rationales for estimating nutrient budgets on crop\n\n\nland. First, cropland is typically where nutrient flows and related environmental impacts are the highest; therefore, cropland budgets and derived indicators such as the surplus are\nmore likely to capture potential pollution hotspots (West et\nal., 2014). Second, permanent meadows and pastures present\nsome particular methodological challenges, primarily due to\nthe lack of global data on productivity and biological N fixation (Tubiello et al., 2023; Schils et al., 2013).\nData presented here build on previous work on estimating\nnational- to global-scale nutrient budgets (or important components of nutrient budgets) over time (Bodirsky et al., 2012;\nBouwman et al., 2017, 2013; Conant et al., 2013; Einarsson\net al., 2020, 2021; FAO, 2021; Herridge et al., 2022; IFA,\n2022a; Kremer, 2013; Lassaletta et al., 2014; Lu and Tian,\n2017; Ludemann et al., 2022a; Mueller et al., 2012; Nishina\net al., 2017; Oenema et al., 2003; Peoples et al., 2021; Vishwakarma et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015, 2021; Zou et al.,\n2022). This study adds additional refinements \u2013 such as new\nestimates of synthetic fertilizer inputs, the fraction of fertilizer applied to cropland, manure, N deposition, biological N fixation and nutrients removed in harvested crops (see\nSect. 2). The new data are made freely available to users\nworldwide for N, P and K budgets, budget components, and\nnutrient use efficiencies, covering 205 countries and territories for the period from 1961 to 2020 (FAO, 2022a). In\nour view, the resulting dataset represents the most complete\ndataset to date on the subject matter, serving as a reference\nfor additional refinements by the scientific community.\n\n\n**2** **Methods**\n\n\nThe cropland nutrient budget (CNB) was developed for N,\nP and K data for all areas of cropland as an FAO land use\ncategory (FAO, 2022a, d) at the country level. The nutrient\nbudget inputs on cropland considered in this work included\nthe application of synthetic fertilizer (SF) (also referred to\nas \u201cchemical fertilizer\u201d or \u201cmineral fertilizer\u201d), manure from\nlivestock, N inputs through biological N fixation and the atmospheric N deposition. The nutrient budget outputs were\nthe nutrients removed via crop harvest. The nutrient budget\nbalance was calculated as the difference between inputs and\noutputs (surplus if positive or deficit if negative). Nutrient\nuse efficiency was computed as the nutrient outputs as a percentage of nutrient inputs.\nThe nutrient balance for country _i_, nutrient _j_ and year _y_\nwas computed as the sum of inputs: SF multiplied by the\nfraction of fertilizer applied to cropland (CF), manure ap\n\n\nEarth Syst.

Collection and analysis of each of these\nCNB components are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n\n2.1 Cropland area\n\n\nCropland area defines the scope of the estimations made\nin this work. Here, cropland is defined, per the FAO land\n[use category for the collection of country data (https://www.](https://www.fao.org/statistics/data-collection/en/)\n[fao.org/statistics/data-collection/en/, last access: 5 Novem-](https://www.fao.org/statistics/data-collection/en/)\nber 2023), as follows: \u201cland used for cultivation of temporary and permanent crops in rotation with fallow, meadows\nand pastures within cycles of up to five years\u201d. It is important to underscore that the land use term \u201ccropland\u201d generally\nencompasses more area than the corresponding term used\nin remote sensing and biophysical modeling, which largely\nrefers only to land areas planted or harvested with annual\ncrops (Tubiello et al., 2023). Identifying flows on cropland\nas a land use category allows for clear operational definitions\nof what is within the scope with regards to CNB data at the\ncountry level in line with FAO reporting. At the same time, it\ngenerates significant uncertainty in the associated quantities,\nas discussed below.\n\n\n2.2 Cropland nutrient budget components\n\n\nInformation on SF inputs was sourced from data on agricultural use from both FAOSTAT (FAOSTAT, 2022) and IFASTAT (IFASTAT, 2022), taking the mean value of the two data\nsources when both were available. The individual datasets\n\nhave been shown to be rather equivalent (FAO, 2022b); therefore, in a reference database, the choice was on a consol\nidated dataset from both sources. All SF values were con\nverted to elemental quantities of nutrients based on a mass\nproportion composition conversion of 0.436 kg of elemental P per kilogram of P 2 O 5 and 0.83 kg of elemental K per\nkilogram of K 2 O. Where necessary, all other inputs and outputs were converted to quantities of elemental nutrients using\nthese conversion factors.\n\nImportantly, both FAO and IFA data refer to fertilizer use\nin agriculture generally, while actual amounts used specifically on cropland are not systematically estimated. The fraction of fertilizer applied to cropland (CF) was therefore\nneeded to determine inputs for the CNB developed in this\nwork. For the majority of countries, due to a lack of specific\ninformation, default cropland fraction estimates of 100 %\n\n\n\n**Table 1.** Percentages (%) of total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and\npotassium (K) fertilizers used in agriculture and applied to cropland\nfor the listed countries for the years from 1961 to 2020.

At the same time, we were\nable to identify 21 countries for which reasonable evidence is\navailable to support specific values of CF for N (Table 1). CF\nfor major crops by country were first estimated for N considering estimates derived from four sources (Zhang et al., 2021;\nEinarsson et al., 2021; Ludemann et al., 2022a; FAO, 2022a).\nThe 21 countries with new CF estimates were selected based\n\non relatively stringent criteria, namely, (1) if a given country had reported CF estimates for N from IFA and/or FAO,\n(2) if selected CF estimates for N use were significantly\nlower than 100 % and (3) if CF estimates were in general\ngood agreement across these various sources. In addition, for\ntwo countries, Ireland and New Zealand, we used the CF values communicated by the country directly to FAO as its part\nof statistical data collection. Conversely, default CF values\n(of 100 %) were used for countries for which (1) there was\nlack of sufficient data, (2) reported estimates were close to\n100 % (e.g., _>_ 90 %) or (3) disagreement existed in reported\nvalues from our available sources. For countries with recom\nmended updates, CF for P was based on reported values by\nZou et al. (2022). The CF values for K were calculated as\naverages of the N and P coefficients. Further clarification of\nthe derivation and screening of CF estimates is included in\nSect. S1 in the Supplement.\n\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024 Earth Syst. Sci.

MAS was estimated as N from\ntreated manure in manure management systems applied to\nsoil following the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse\nGas Emission Inventories at Tier 1 (e.g., FAO, 2022c). The\nassociated P and K quantities were subsequently estimated\nusing published P : N and K : N conversion ratios (Statistics\nNetherlands, 2012; Sheldrick et al., 2003) (Table 2). The N,\nP and K nutrients from manure from livestock were apportioned to cropland based on the same CF values shown in\nTable 1.\n\nAtmospheric deposition (AD) refers to N inputs from the\natmosphere as dry and wet N deposition, considering both\nthe reduced and oxidized forms; this information was derived from a review of existing methods and related data\nsources for national-scale data, as described in Vishwakarma\net al. (2023). Of the four datasets for AD, the product comprising Land-Use Harmonization (LUH2; Hurtt et al., 2020),\nWang et al. (2019), Shang et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2017)\ndata were used in the CNB. The flows of P and K through atmospheric deposition are generally negligible (Einarsson et\nal., 2020) and were, therefore, not included in the CNB.\nBiological fixation (BF) of N by grain legume crops was\nestimated using a yield-dependent and regionally specific\nmodel presented by Peoples et al. (2021) and Herridge et\nal. (2022). This model was based on statistical regressions for\neight categories of grain legumes: chickpea, common bean,\nfaba bean, groundnut, lupin, pigeon pea, soybean and other.\nFor soybean, the model further distinguishes Brazil, Europe\nand the rest of the world. The model assumes a nonlinear\n\ndependence of the BF rate on crop yield and, therefore, in\ncontrast to earlier publications, does not lead to fixed ratios\nbetween the harvest area and BF. Further details on these\n\nmodels are included in Sect. S2. Forage legumes were not accounted for due to the lack of production data (see Sect. 2.3.1\n\n\n\nbelow). For non-legume crops, BF was estimated using fixed\nglobal per-hectare coefficients of 25 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] for rice\nand sugarcane (see Sect. S2 for a detailed explanation). With\nthe exception of rice and sugarcane, N fixation from freeliving N-fixing bacteria in other crops was not included in\nthe CNB. The source code (in R and Python) and detailed\noutput for the BF estimates are freely available (Einarsson,\n2023b, a).\nCrop removal (CR) rates were calculated using crop nutrient removal coefficients multiplied by crop production\nstatistics. The crop production data were taken from FAOSTAT (FAO, 2022e). Crop nutrient removal coefficients from\nSect. S3, which were derived from a meta-analysis described\nby Ludemann et al. (2023a), were used to estimate total crop\nnutrient removal. Crop species that did not have specific crop\nnutrient concentration values from Ludemann et al. (2023a)\n(version date 7 March 2023) were gap-filled using weightedaverage nutrient concentrations of the crop species in the\nsame \u201cItem Group\u201d using the 2014 harvested-area values as\nweighting factors. The source code for standardizing and analyzing the CR data in R was published separately by Ludemann (2022) and Ludemann et al. (2023a).\nThe same aforementioned coefficients for all of the CNB\ncomponents were applied to each year across the full time\nseries.\n\n\n2.3 Data limitations and uncertainty\n\n\n2.3.1 Scope\n\n\nThe nutrient budgets presented here refer to the FAO cropland area (as defined in Sect. 2.1) but also acknowledge that\nthere is substantial uncertainty in cropland area measurement\nand a variety of definitions across various relevant land cover\nproducts (Tubiello et al., 2023). The world\u2019s cropland area\nused in the present study was taken from FAOSTAT (FAO,\n2022e) and was 1 _._ 562 \u00d7 10 [9] ha for 2020. This compares well\nto the 1 _._ 215 \u00d7 10 [9] \u20132 _._ 002 \u00d7 10 [9] ha range and \u223c 25 % relative\nuncertainty in cropland area recently estimated by Tubiello\net al. (2023) (Table 3, Sect. S4). In addition, the CNB excludes crops with no production data in FAOSTAT (FAO,\n2022e); these include forage crops such as alfalfa, clover and\ngrass\u2013clover mixtures. Exclusion of these crops likely leads\nto a substantial underestimation of cropland nutrient removal\nand, in some cases, cropland biological N fixation in countries where forage legumes are major components of cropland, such as Australia, Argentina, several European countries (Einarsson et al., 2021), New Zealand and the United\nStates of America (Lassaletta et al., 2014). Another cause of\nuncertainty in the CNB arises from how the parameters were\nestimated, as is described in the next section.\n\n\n2.3.2 Uncertainty\n\n\nNutrient budgets tend to have large uncertainties (Lesschen\net al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2020; Pathak et al., 2010). How\n\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 525\u2013541, 2024 https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024\n\n\nC. I.

[b] Uncertainty was\nexpressed as the coefficient of variation to 2 significant figures.\n\n\n\never, in general, there appears to be more certainty in the\ndirection (e.g., is it a negative or positive balance) and its\nevolution in time for a given country than in the magnitude\nof nutrient balances. For example, where multiple studies estimated the N, P and K balances for Burkina Faso, there was\ngood concordance (90 % showing same direction) with respect to whether there was a deficit or surplus (Lesschen et\nal., 2007). However, the coefficient of variation in these estimates of nutrient balances in Burkina Faso made by the various researchers was 27 % for N, 167 % for P and 115 % for\nK (Lesschen et al., 2007). At a global level, estimates of the\nquantity of N surplus also have great uncertainty. This is evidenced by the more than 50 % differences in the estimated\nN surplus quantity depending on whose estimate is used, as\nanalyzed by Zhang et al. (2021).\nEach contributing item of the CNB has varying levels of\nuncertainty, with N deposition having the greatest relative\nuncertainty (CV of \u223c 70 %) and crop production having the\nleast uncertainty (CV of \u223c 7 %) (Table 3). At the same time,\nN deposition is a small contributor to the overall N budget,\nwith values across the world (as a mean) being less than\n10 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1], so that its contribution to overall uncertainty is also small (Sect. S4). Conversely, items expected to\ncontribute substantially to the overall CNB include SF use\nand coefficients for estimating crop nutrient removal. These\nitems had similar (\u223c 20 %\u201325 %) uncertainty (Sect. S4). The\npreceding estimates of uncertainty used data that best represented the nutrient component (e.g., CV % values for maize,\nrice, soybeans and wheat were used to represent uncertainty\nin crop nutrient removal, as these crops make up the majority\nof total grain production worldwide) following IPCC (2006).\nIt is important to note that there could be greater uncertainties associated with items that were not included in this as\nsessment due to a lack of data and/or because items were\n\ndeemed to make a minor contribution to the overall CNB.\n\nWhile cropland area has a reasonable 25 % estimate of\nuncertainty, this value does not elucidate the challenges in\n\n\nvolved with quantifying the nutrient inputs and outputs from\nthis category of land. Three main issues arise in the current CNB: (1) it is assumed that the same CF values for SF\nare used to apportion nutrients from manure from livestock\nto cropland, (2) no nutrient outputs from the herbage removed from some of the categories of cropland (e.g., temporary meadows and pasture or silage maize) are accounted for\nand (3) the exchange of manure between countries is not accounted for. The Netherlands is an example of a country extremely affected by the limitations of the current methodology. Much of the manure from the dairy sector in the Netherlands is applied on-farm to areas of land growing maize for\nsilage or temporary or permanent meadows and pastures.\nHowever, the proportion of manure applied to cropland may\nnot correspond to the CF values estimated for SF. There is\nuncertainty in these estimates. In addition, none of the nutrients removed as herbage from the maize for silage or grazed\nor mown temporary meadows or pastures are included in the\ntotal estimate of nutrient outputs. Further, the Netherlands\nexports 10 % of its manure from livestock to other countries.\nBetter accounting for N outputs from herbage removed in\nthe Dutch \u201cmaize for silage\u201d scenario, \u201ctemporary meadows\nand pastures\u201d scenario or both scenarios combined was estimated to increase the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) from\nthe original 30 % in the CNB to 58 %, 50 % and 77 %, respectively (Sect. S5). Conversely, accounting for exports of\nmanure from the Netherlands to neighboring countries was\nshown to increase the NUE from 30 % to 32 % (Sect. S5).\nWhile the Netherlands is an extreme case, other countries\n\nwith a substantial number of livestock and substantial ar\neas of meadows and pastures or fodder crops like maize for\nsilage (e.g., Ireland, Denmark and New Zealand) could also\nbe affected, albeit to a lesser degree (Sect. S5). It must also\nbe noted that the aforementioned scenarios do not account\n\nfor the confounding effect of manure applied to permanent\nmeadows and pastures, and this could also substantially effect estimates of nutrient surplus and the NUE.\n\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024 Earth Syst.

Ludemann et al.: A global FAOSTAT reference database of cropland nutrient budgets\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Possible future improvements\n\n\nApart from improving the accuracy and granularity of components that already exist in the CNB, there are several options for future developments of this database.\nAs highlighted in Sects. 2.3.2 and S5, the area of fodder\nand forage crops in a country can have a substantial effect on\nnutrient budgets and estimates of nutrient use efficiency. Including estimates of nutrients removed as fodder and forage\ncrops will therefore allow for a fairer comparison between\ncountries for indicators included in the CNB.\n\nAn important future development of the CNB is to more\nexplicitly account for changes in soil nutrient stocks, which\nare currently \u201chidden\u201d in the estimated surpluses or deficits.\nHowever, this will be difficult given the dynamic and stochastic characteristics of soil system processes (Cobo et al.,\n2010).\nIncluding results at a sub-country and crop-specific level\nis a further area of development. Issues with apportioning\nfertilizer and manure to different land use classes or crops\nwill need to be overcome to succeed in spatially disaggregating nutrient budgets and also to accurately estimate separate\nnutrient budgets for cropland and permanent meadows and\npastures. While data on SF use by crops are available at a\nglobal scale (Ludemann et al., 2022a), estimation of quantities of manure applied to each crop requires suitable survey\ndata that do not yet exist globally. Management of manure\nduring housing and storage before it is applied to cropland\nalso varies spatially and temporally. This can have a substantial effect on the concentrations of nutrients in manure\n\n(Statistics Netherlands, 2012), leading to uncertainty in the\nquantities of nutrients applied as manure. In addition, use\nof the same value for the fraction of N fertilizer applied to\ncropland as that used for the fraction of livestock manure applied to cropland introduces uncertainty in the overall CNB\nestimates. As described in Sect. S5, this assumption may not\nhold for every country. Introduction of country-specific fractions representing the proportion of manure from livestock\nthat is applied to cropland will be an important improvement\nin future iterations of the CNB.\n\nThe current database does not include estimates of nutri\nents removed as crop residues, nor are the nutrient concentrations of crop products used in the current database countryspecific (see Sect. S3). Progress is being made toward improved predictions of a crop harvest index that can be used to\ndetermine the quantities of crop residues based on the quantities of crop products (Ludemann et al., 2022b). However, no\nstudies with a global scale are available to indicate the proportion of crop residues removed from the land at harvest.\nThis will require the extensive collection of survey information to get more relevant crop- and country-specific values.\nFor improved estimates of nutrients removed as crop prod[ucts, open databases (http://www.cropnutrientdata.net, last](http://www.cropnutrientdata.net)\naccess: 2 October 2023; Ludemann et al., 2023a) and prediction models are being developed to support country- and sub\n\n\ncountry-specific nutrient concentrations of these crop components. As country- and crop-specific coefficients (Tier 2 or\nTier 3 level) are developed, these can be included in future\niterations of the CNB.\n\nSome nutrient inputs currently excluded from the CNB\n(e.g., nutrients in irrigation water and nutrients in composted\ncrop residues or human manure) could be included in the future, especially in countries where these constitute a significant contribution to overall inputs (Serra et al., 2023).\nFinally, with new capabilities becoming available from\nthe spatialization of aggregated data to georeferenced grids,\nthe current version and future updates of the database distributed here can provide local-scale information on specific\ngeographic regions \u2013 information that is generally associated\nwith lower uncertainty, specifically in countries with a large\nsurface area where only small portions are used for agricul\nture.\n\n\n**3** **Results and discussion**\n\n\n3.1 Global and regional estimates\n\n\nGlobal CNB surpluses (i.e., greater nutrient inputs than outputs) were recorded for all three plant nutrients in 2020, with\nnutrient loading of N, P and K progressively increasing over\nthe 1961\u20132020 period, except for K across all cropland since\n1961 (which decreased by 20 %) (Table 4; Fig. 1a, b). On a\nper-hectare basis N, P and K nutrient surpluses changed by\n320 %, 110 % and \u221227 %, respectively, from 1961 to 2020\n(Table 5).\nThe greatest contributor to nutrient inputs in 2020 was SF,\nfollowed by biological N fixation for N and manure applied\nto the soil for P and K (Table 4). The greatest change in any\ninput or output of nutrients (between 1961 and 2020) was\nthe increase in use of SF, with changes of 1000 %, 370 %\nand 380 % estimated for N, P and K, respectively. In 1961,\nthe main nutrient inputs were from livestock manures for all\nthree plant nutrients. With the increase in SF use came a decrease in the relative importance of manure as a source of\ntotal N inputs. N inputs from manure went from contributing \u223c 38 % of the total N inputs in 1961 to \u223c 14 % in 2020\n(Table 4). Over the same period, SF went from contributing\n22 % of total N inputs to 58 % (Table 4).\nThe greatest absolute increases in global N balances were\nestimated between 1961 and 1988 (Fig. 1a, b), followed by a\nshort-term decrease and then by a less marked increase over\nthe last 3 decades until 2020. At the same time, there was\na decreasing trend in N use efficiency from an overall value\nof 59 % in 1961 to 55 % in 2020 (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the\nP and K use efficiencies increased over the same period, in\nparticular since the 1980s, from 64 % to 75 % for P and from\n46 % to 80 % for K (Fig. 1c). Note that the nutrient use efficiency tends to become higher than 100 % when nutrient\ninputs are very low; this requires careful interpretation. It\nmay either point to undesirable soil nutrient mining, e.g., in\n\n\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 525\u2013541, 2024 https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024\n\n\nC. I.

K surpluses were consistently greater than P surpluses\nacross the same period (Fig. 1a).\n\n\n3.2 Country estimates\n\n\nThere was large heterogeneity in CNB values by country in\n2020 (Fig. 2). Countries with N, P or K deficits or surpluses\ngreater than the upper (80th) quantile are highlighted using\nred in Fig. 2, those with values between the 60th and 80th\nquantile are highlighted using orange, those with values be\n\n\ntween the 40th and 60th quantile are highlighted using yellow, those between the 20th and 40th quantile are highlighted\nusing dark green, and those below the 20th quantile are highlighted using light green. Countries in Africa had cropland\nN surpluses of less than 40 kg ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] (with the exception of Egypt with 200 kg ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] ). Most European countries had N surpluses of between 40 and 80 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1],\nwhereas some of the largest values were found in Asia. For\ninstance, China and India had average N surpluses of 140 kg\nand 120 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1], respectively (Fig. 2). The total number of countries with negative N, P and K surpluses (nutrient\ndeficits) was 14, 64 and 59 in 2020, respectively. It is important to note that extreme values for some countries may represent errors in the data collected for those countries (such as\nthe SF use quantities), rather than (or in addition to) actual\ndifferences in agronomic performance.

Combining information from Figs. 2 and 3, some\ncountries show differences between their status for the nutri\nent balance and nutrient use efficiency. N in Kazakhstan, for\nexample, is ranked lower in terms of the N balance (a deficit\nof 3 kg ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] ), whereas it is ranked highly in terms of\nN use efficiency (a NUE of 120 %), indicating a risk of soil\nmining. Note, however, that orange colors in Fig. 3 (efficiencies exceeding 90 %) may be desirable in regions that have\nhistorically received large P or K applications that are causing environmental problems. Therefore, it is important to account for this context when evaluating the NUE of a specific\ncountry in the CNB.\n\n\n\nOf the \u201ctop 10 countries\u201d ranked based on the quantity of\nsynthetic N fertilizer used per country in 2020, four were in\nAsia (China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia) (Fig. 4). Of these\ntop 10 countries, France had the greatest N, P and K surpluses per hectare between 1961 and 1986 (with a surplus of\n\u223c 110 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] in 1986) (Fig. 4a). After this point, the\nper-hectare N surpluses in China became greater than those\nin France. By 1995 and 2014, China started to have a greater\nP and K surplus than France: surpluses of 21 kg P ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1]\n\nand 35 kg K ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] in China, respectively (Fig. 4a). There\nwere generally negative trends in the N use efficiency for the\ntop 10 countries over the 1961 to 2000 period, after which\nthere was an overall stabilization of annual values (Fig. 4b).\nExceptions to this negative trend for N were for Brazil and\nUkraine, potentially caused by greater harvested areas of Nfixing soybeans. There was a greater range in P and K use efficiency over time compared with N use efficiency (Fig. 4b),\nwith countries such as Indonesia having a greater than 200 %\n\n\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

The relative larger increase in the growth\nof inputs vs. outputs has concurrently resulted in greater nutrient surpluses for N and P, whereas K surpluses have decreased. This indicates that more emphasis has been placed\nglobally on inputs of N and P compared with K, relative to\nremoved nutrients. Many soils still have substantial native K\nresources, and the returns on investment for the application\nof K on cropland are often less than those obtained from applying N and P.

Ludemann et al.: A global FAOSTAT reference database of cropland nutrient budgets\n\n\nsoils are in available K relative to other nutrients may also\nplay a role.\nWithin the 1961 to 2020 time period, the fastest increase\nin annual N, P and K surpluses occurred between 1961 and\n1988. This was followed by a fall in surpluses that was followed by relatively stable (for N) or declining trends in (P\nand K) balances on a total and per-hectare basis. The decline\nin fertilizer consumption the late 1980s/early 1990s was most\nlikely caused by the breakup of the former Soviet Union and\npolitical changes in much of eastern Europe (FAO, 2022b).\nAt the same time, there was also growing awareness of the\nenvironmental effects of unsustainable agricultural management practices in other parts of the world (Cassou, 2018).\nFor example, in the late 1980s, the European Union (EU)\nstarted implementing policies that reduced direct payments,\nwhile there was an increase in payments linked to environmental objectives (Cassou, 2018). As a result, the EU N, P\nand K surpluses have decreased over the last 3 decades. For\ninstance, the EU was estimated to have had respective decreases of about 40 %, 80 % and 60 % for N, P and K surpluses on a per-hectare basis. These tendencies initially impacted global trends, although they have been progressively\ncounterbalanced by increasing surpluses in major countries\nsuch as China, India, Pakistan and Brazil, largely due to substantial increases in SF use in recent decades. For instance,\nthe application rates in China, India, Pakistan and Brazil increased by 230 % (as a mean across countries and across N,\nP and K) between 1990 and 2020, and N, P and K surpluses\nincreased by nearly 300 % (as a mean across those countries)\nover the same period.\n\n\n3.4 Comparisons with previous studies\n\n\n\n**Figure 3.** Cropland nutrient use efficiency (in percent) for different\nareas of the world for **(a)** nitrogen (N), **(b)** elemental phosphorus\n(P) and **(c)** elemental potassium (K) for 2020.

The final status of Jammu and Kashmir has not\nyet been agreed upon by the parties. Nutrient use efficiency ranges\nwere based on values suggested by the EU Nitrogen Expert Panel\n(2016).\n\n\n\nThe general trends in N inputs, outputs, balances and use efficiencies over time in the present study were broadly consistent with estimates from previous studies (Fig. 5a, b, c and d,\nrespectively), with some exceptions. Over the 1961 to 2020\nperiod, estimates of N inputs from the current study were\n\u201cmid-range\u201d compared with the other studies (Fig. 5a), but\nN outputs were generally greater than those estimated from\nother studies (Fig. 5b). This resulted in estimates of N balances over time that were mid-range compared with other\nstudies (Fig. 5c) as well as N use efficiencies that were generally greater than estimates from other studies (Fig. 5d).\nMultiple factors could have contributed to the inter-study\nvariation in indicators shown in Fig. 5. Firstly, FAOSTAT\ncrop production and fertilizer data have been updated since\nthe previous studies were published. Any changes in historic\ncrop production and fertilizer input data will contribute to\ndifferences in estimates of total N outputs and N inputs, respectively. To put this into context, Zhang et al. (2021) indicated that the FAOSTAT value for China\u2019s N fertilizer use\nwas 10 \u00d7 10 [6] tyr [\u2212][1] lower based on the 2017 version of the\ndata compared with the 2000 version.

A summary of existing parameters\nof N content by crop type has shown large divergence among\nstudies (Zhang et al., 2020), and some studies also do not account for the N content in the crop types that have limited\ndata. Taking advantage of existing data, the present study developed and used gap-filled crop product nutrient concentrations, but future research is needed to improve the availability\nand quality of such data.\nNotwithstanding the potential sources of difference in absolute estimates, all previous studies estimated the fastest increase in N surpluses between 1961 and around 1988, a drop\nin N surpluses for a few years, and a subsequent less steep increase until 2020 (Fig. 5c). N use efficiency decreased from\n1961 until around 1988, followed by an increase in N use\nefficiency until 2020. Similar trends over time predicted by\nthe various models in Fig. 5 may be attributed to the fact\n\n\n\nthat many of the models used similar sources of data. For\nexample, 5 of the 10 other models included in Fig. 5 used\nFAOSTAT cropland area data, 8 of the 10 used FAOSTAT\nfertilizer use data and at least 4 of the 10 used FAOSTAT\n\ncrop production data. Many of the models included in Fig. 5\nused similar sources of data; therefore, the variation in the\noverall N balance values will not fully account for the variation and uncertainty in estimates of key parameters. As described in Sect. 2.1, some of the most important parameters for estimating CNB at a country and global level did\nnot have excessively high uncertainty (e.g., cropland area\nCV % of \u223c 25 %, crop production CV % of \u223c 7 % and fertilizer use and crop removal CV % of \u223c 20 %). Parameters\nwith the most uncertainty (e.g., N deposition with a CV %\nof \u223c 70 %) contributed only a small amount to the total N\nbalance ( _<_ 10 kg N ha [\u2212][1] yr [\u2212][1] on average across the world).\nThis highlights the importance of focusing on refining es\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024 Earth Syst.

The scale of the variation\nin values between the two studies shown in Table 6 is not\n\nsurprising given the known uncertainties in the estimates of\nmanure and SF application rates for China (Ludemann et al.,\n2022a). New datasets like those from Zhang et al. (2023) will\nbe evaluated regarding how well they may improve the CNB\nand, when found useful, will be incorporated into future iterations of the FAOSTAT data product.\n\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024 Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 525\u2013541, 2024\n\n\n538 C. I. Ludemann et al.: A global FAOSTAT reference database of cropland nutrient budgets\n\n\n\nThe general trends in P inputs, outputs, balances (surpluses\nand deficits) and use efficiencies over time in the present\nstudy were broadly consistent with estimates from Zou et\nal. (2022) (Fig. 6a, b, c and d, respectively). However, P inputs and outputs and the phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) estimated in the current study were generally greater than those\nestimated by Zou et al. (2022). Concurrently, the P surplus\nwas estimated as being less in the current study than in Zou\net al. (2022), and the difference in estimates increased after\n1990 and especially after 2008, when the Zou et al. (2022)\nestimates became substantially greater than our current esti\nmates.\n\nZou et al. (2022) used the same FAO (2022d) areas of\ncropland and fertilizer input values as those used in the current study, indicating that crop P removal is the main contributor with respect to these differences in values. Estimates of the concentration of P in crop products used in the\npresent study were generally greater than those used by Zou\net al. (2022). This explains why crop P removal (outputs) and\nPUE in the present study are greater than those estimated\nby Zou et al. (2022). For example, of the major crops in the\ncurrent study, rice, soybeans and maize had 12 %, 30 % and\n18 % greater P concentrations than those reported in Zou et\nal. (2022). Concentrations of P in wheat and barley in the\ncurrent study were estimated as being 4 % and 2 % less than\nthose used by Zou et al. (2022).\nA reason that the estimates of P inputs by Zou et al. (2022)\nare less than those in the current study is that Zou et al. (2022)\nused a different method to assign the fraction of total fertilizer used in agriculture to cropland. Zou et al. (2022) assumed that the fractions of P fertilizer used for cropland are\nthe same as the fractions of N fertilizer used for cropland,\nfollowing Zhang et al. (2015). In addition, the FAO has updated its fertilizer input data since the Zou et al. (2022) study\nwas published. This may also have contributed to these differences in P inputs.\n\n\n**4** **Code and data availability**\n\n\nThe CNB data presented in this study cover the period\nfrom 1961 to 2020 at the country level, with aggregates\nmade at the regional and global scales. These data are avail[able from https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hx3ffbgkh (Lude-](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hx3ffbgkh)\nmann et al., 2023b) and from the FAOSTAT cropland nutrient\n[budget database (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ESB,](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ESB)\nFAO, 2022a). The R code used to create the tables and figures in this article can be accessed via the following Zenodo\n[repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10491879 (Lude-](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10491879)\nmann, 2023).\nFurther information on the derivation of cropland fraction estimates for N, including our analytical code,\ncan be accessed via the following Zenodo repository:\n[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10511851 (Jackson, 2024).](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10511851)\n\n\n\n**5** **Conclusions**\n\n\nA new reference database of cropland nutrient budgets has\nbeen detailed in this paper. The data are available in FAOSTAT for the time period from 1961 to 2020, with plans\nfor annual updates and continuous methodological improvements. Insights gained from these data include the quantification of the hotspot areas from which there may be a surplus\nor insufficiency of N, P or K nutrients. For example, all world\nregions apart from Oceania and Africa showed some, to substantial, N surpluses until 2020. This is a reflection of the\nbroader trend toward greater SF N use over that period. However, there were P and K deficits for Africa and K deficits for\nthe Americas during the same period. Over time, Europe\u2019s\nrelative importance in terms of the overall contribution to\nN balances was surpassed by Asia (in particular China) in\nthe 1980s. Increasing trends in N surpluses have also been\nshown in other studies, albeit with considerable variation in\nthe absolute values each year due to differences in the model\nsetups and sources of data used. Our estimated trends in the\nNUE over time broadly aligned with other studies, except\nthat our NUE values were generally greater than those from\nother studies. This was a consequence of our estimated N\noutputs being greater than those of other studies. While there\nwas considerable uncertainty (\u223c 72 % expressed as a CV)\nassociated with some contributing components to the CNB\ncalculation in the present study, the components with most\nuncertainty generally had the least influence on the overall\nCNB values. The most influential parameters with respect to\nthe estimates of CNB included cropland area, crop production, fertilizer use and crop removal coefficients; therefore,\nthese factors should be prioritized for improved accuracy in\nthe future. It is also important to note that limitations regarding the availability of data could have a substantial effect on\nestimates of overall nutrient balance or nutrient use efficiency\nfor cropland for some countries. This is especially important\nin relation to how nutrients (from fertilizers and manure) are\nassigned to areas of forage and fodder crops and the nutrient\nofftake from these crops as well as in relation to exports of\nmanure from livestock to other countries and manure application to permanent meadows and pastures. Therefore, further refinements will be an ongoing area of development in\nfuture iterations of the FAO CNB.\n\n\n**Supplement.** The supplement related to this article is available\n[online at: https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024-supplement.](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-525-2024-supplement)\n\n\n**Author contributions.** CIL collated the manure and crop nutrient removal coefficients, performed the analysis of data, and wrote\nthe manuscript.

Long-term fertilizer experiments conducted over 30 years in different agroecological regions involving diversified cropping systems and soil types showed\nsignificant responses of crops to K applications, the effects being more\npronounced in Alfisols and acidic Inceptisols (Aeric Haplaquept). After several\nyears of intensive cropping, response to K application occurred even in alluvial\nsoils dominated by K bearing minerals (illite). Application of K enhanced its\navailable status in soils and uptake by the crops. Contribution of the nonexchangeable K towards total potassium removal was above 90% in the absence\nof applied K which decreased to about 80% with the use of K. Studies on K\nrelease kinetics and Q/I parameters showed that cumulative K release was\nhigher in K treated soils as compared to untreated ones thereby causing a\ngreater decline in non exchangeable K reserves. The results suggest that in\nyears ahead K will be the most limiting factor affecting sustainability of intensive\ncropping systems in India. Therefore, due attention must be paid to K nutrition\nin fertilizer scheduling for different crops/cropping systems.\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nIn most of the intensive cropping systems in India, potassium (K) balance is\nnegative since the additions of K seldom match the K removals resulting in\nlarger dependence on soil K supply. Under such conditions there is greater\npressure on non-exchangeable K for meeting the K requirement of crops.\nLong-term intensive cropping, in the absence of K inputs, adversely affected\nthe K supply to crop plants and consequently crop yields (Swarup, 1998;\nSwarup and Ganeshmurthy, 1998). Potassium deficiencies are now more\n\n\n_**168**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_\n\n\nwidespread even on heavy textured soils such as alluvial illitic soils in India.\nSeveral studies have shown substantial contribution of non-exchangeable K\ntowards K nutrition of crops grown on illite dominant alluvial soils (Srinivasa\nRao _et al.,_ 2001; Swarup and Chhillar, 1986). This is particularly so when\ncropping continues with N + P application without K addition. The K release\nrates from soils under long-term cropping, fertilization and manuring helps\nto predict the fate of added K in soil as well as nature of K supply from soil\nto plant K nutrition. This paper critically reviews the work done on soil\npotassium and its impact on the sustainability of crop production under the\nAll India Coordinated Research Project of ICAR on Long-term Fertilizer\nExperiments.\n\n\n**Crop responses and K uptake vis-\u00e0-vis sustainability issues**\n\n\nIt is generally considered that most of the Indian soils are adequate in K\nsupply. Cereals especially those with deep rooting system often fail to respond\n\nto K in seasonal/short term field trials. The immediate conclusion drawn\n\ncould be that no K is required for such cereals at these locations. However,\nthe situation changes when intensive cropping is followed over the years on\n\nthe same site with N + P fertilizer alone because with consecutive exhaustion\n\nthe true response to K becomes obvious. For example, the crops under longterm experiments on a Mollisol soil at Pantnagar (Nand Ram, 1998) and\nVertisol soil at Jabalpur (Tembhare _et al.,_ 1998) responded to K only after few\nyears of cropping because of its good spatial K exploitation whereas trend in\nyield declines occurred from the beginning in Alfisols at Bangalore, Ranchi\nand Palampur and in an Inceptisol (Aeric Haplaquept) at Bhubaneswar ( **Figs.**\n**1 to 4, Table 1** ). Even in K rich alluvial soil (Typic Ustocrept) at Ludhiana,\nmaize and wheat responded to K application from the very beginning (Brar\nand Pasricha, 1998). A comparison of mean response of K (NPK over NP)\nshowed that yield responses to N and P fertilizer declined in all the soils, the\neffects being more pronounced in Alfisols and more so at Bangalore under\nfinger millet-maize cropping system ( **Table 1** ). On the contrary, a declining\ntrend in response to K fertilizer was observed in maize at Ludhiana and rice\nat Pantnagar after about 10 years of continuous cropping. It was found to be\nassociated with the emergence of Zn deficiency. Thus it can be inferred that\nthe real response to K fertilization can be fully realised only when all the\nlimiting plant nutrients (secondary and micronutrients) are present in optimal\namounts in the soil ( **Table 2** ).

The uptake data of various crops suggest\nthat fertilizer K recommendations for crops should take into consideration\nnon-exchangeable fraction of soil K.\n\n\nThe change in the cumulative release of K after 20 years of cropping from\nan Inceptisol at Hyderabad ( **Fig. 5** ) indicated the relative contribution of soil\nreserve K (non-exchangeable K) in crop K uptake. While there were fewer\nchanges in the available K form during the period of 20 years, change in nonexchangeable K was more conspicuous. This shows the need to include nonexchangeable K in soil testing methodology, as it was more sensitive to crop\nK removal (Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 2000). Similarly, there was considerable\ndecrease in K release from non-exchangeable fraction of soil K with 20 years\nof cropping ( **Fig. 6** ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_**Fig. 5.

Continuous application of nitrogenous fertilizers alone to soils had a\ndeleterious effect on soil productivity especially in soils deficient in P and\nK; the effects being more pronounced on Alfisols (Palampur, Ranchi and\nBangalore). The available K status in these plots declined to less than\ncritical levels ( **Fig. 7** ). 150% NPK or 100% NPK+FYM maintained higher\navailable pools of K.\n\n\n2. At Ludhiana and Palampur total productivity in the maize-wheat system\nincreased over the years, mainly due to increased productivity of Wheat.\nThis reflects that although the K level in the soil has improved over the\nyears with the application of NPK but yet their optimum levels in the soil\nhave not been attained. This behaviour is confirmed by available K status\nin the soil at both these centres. Similarly, in soybean-wheat system at\nRanchi, the wheat yield has shown increasing trend over the years,\n\n\n_**176**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_\n\n\nobviously, due to improved status of K in the soil in NP treatment over\nN as the soil had deficiency of K to start with.\n\n\n3. There is also evidence at many centres that the crops started drawing on\nthe non-exchangeable source of K when the exchangeable K amount fell\nbelow the critical limits. An excellent example of such a change is provided\nby the experiment at Jabalpur and Bhubneswar centres. The results clearly\nshowed that mining of soil K occurred even with NPK treatment. It is\nindicated that under intensive cropping, the K deficiency will gradually\nincrease unless adequate quantity of K is added from external sources\nsuch as fertilizers and manures. Likewise, the results of experiments on\nfinger millet-rabi maize cropping system at Bangalore clearly indicate\nthat certain treatments with N alone or NP depressed the yields to the\nsame level as the unmanured plot whereas with NPK or NPK + FYM\ntreatments, the yields were stable at higher level. The available K status\n\nof the soil indicated that the soil was not able to meet the K demand of\n\nthe crops. Thus severe K deficiency is limiting the responses to NP.\n\n\n_Impact of Long-Term Intensive Cropping on Soil Potassium and Sustainability of Crop Production_ _**177**_\n\n\n4. The declining trend in yield at many centres indicates the need for critical\nexamination and modification of the existing K fertilizer recommendation\nto compensate for gradual loss of native soil K fertility. Results at\nBhubaneswar centre ( **Table 3** ) with superimposed treatments showed that\nenhanced dose of K in excess of 100% NPK is extremely important for\nimproving rice-rice productivity and maintaining available K in the soils.\n\n\n**Table 3: Effect of superimposition of treatments on grain yield of rice at Bhubaneswar**\n\n|Superimposed treatment|Grain yield (t ha-1)|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|_Superimposed treatment_|_1994-95_|_1994-95_|_1995-96_|_1995-96_|_1996-97_|_1996-97_|\n|_Superimposed treatment_|_Kharif_|_Rabi_|_Kharif_|_Rabi_|_Kharif_|_Rabi_|\n|**Treatment 8 of Replication III**<br>ST1-100% NPK + FYM|3.28|3.20|2.50|2.98|3.14|2.96|\n|ST2-100% N + 50% P + 100% K + FYM|3.28|3.14|2.48|3.09|3.14|2.94|\n|ST3-100% N + 50% P + 150% K + FYM|3.39|3.17|2.71|3.20|3.30|3.12|\n\n\n\n**Non-exchangeable K release rates in different soil types under intensive**\n**cropping**\n\n\nSome workers have shown that intensive cropping for a long period would\nreduce the exchangeable K to a minimum level and at this level the release\nof non-exchangeable potassium starts (Sachdeva and Khera, 1980). Krishna\nKumari _et al._ (1984) investigated the potassium release behaviour of an\ninceptisol (Holambi series) at the minimum level of exchangeable potassium\nand found that there was no response to potassium fertilizer applications,\neven when the soil was intensively fertilized with N and P without addition\nof potassium for ten years. Consecutively no K deficiency symptoms were\nexhibited by maize and wheat crops. On the basis of six successive cropping\nwith pearlmillet, Mehta (1976) found that non-exchangeable K contributed\n81% of the total K removed by plants in the alluvial soils of Gujarat. The\nreason proposed for the rapid release of non-exchangeable K under intensive\ncropping is that a concentration gradient is set up from high concentration of\nK in unexpanded towards the K depleted expanded part of the clay (Thomas,\n1967).\n\n\nUse of organic acids to extract non-exchangeable K from soil is believed\nto match the root extraction to soil K during intensive cropping. The\ncumulative K release was higher in Vertisols followed by Inceptisols and\n\n\n_**178**_ _J.S. Samra and Anand Swarup_\n\n\nAlfisols. Smectitic soil released about 25% whereas illitic soil released about\n\n13% of non-exchangeable K to in malic acid.\n\n\nEven though illite or mica is the primary source of non-exchangeable K in\nInceptisols as well as Vertisols, the relative mobility of K from the illite minerals\nof Inceptisols is less compared to that of Vertisols. This is also observed from\nlower release rate constants of Inceptisols (3.5 h [\u20131] ), compared to Alfisols (3.52\nh [\u20131] ) and Vertisols (4.03 h [\u20131] ). Differences in the composition of illite such as\nbiotite or muscovite could make a very substantial difference in K release\nbetween Vertisols and Inceptisols (Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 2001).\n\n\n**Changes in non-exchangeable K and its contribution to plant K uptake**\n\n\nChange in Non-exchangeable K of soils under intensive cropping has been\nobserved in many cases irrespective of the available K status and dominant\nminerals of soils. Effect of long-term rice-rice cropping, fertilisation and\nmanuring on K release pattern in 0.01 M CaCl 2 and by electro-ultra filtration\n(EUF) fraction (Srinivas Rao _et al.,_ 2000) indicated a substantial reduction in\nK release from soils due to continuous cropping. Application of 100% NPK\n+ 15 t FYM maintained higher K release whereas 100% NP showed the lowest\nK release. Non-exchangeable K released during 30-35 minutes in EUF\nextraction also indicated a similar change. It can be observed from the pattern\nof EUF desorption that K desorbed during the first 30 minutes (which indicates\nexchangeable from of K) did not vary much among treatments whereas the\ndifferences were much clear in EUF 30-35 K (Non-exchangeable K). Nonexchangeable release rate constants of Inceptisol as influenced by 14 years of\nrice-rice cropping, fertilization and manuring ( **Table 4** ) also indicated\nconsiderable decrease in non-exchangeable K release due to cropping\n\n\n**Table 4:** **Non-exchangeable K release rate constants in 0.01 M citric acid (zero order X 10** **[2]** **)**\n**of Incptisols as influenced by 14 years rice-rice cropping, fertilization and**\n\n\n|manuring|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|_Treatment_|_1980_|_1980_|_1994_|_1994_|\n|_Treatment_|_0-73 h_|_0-217 h_|_0-73 h_|_0-217 h_|\n|Control<br>100% N<br>100% NP<br>100% NPK<br>100% NPK+FYM|53<br>40<br>36<br>63<br>75|29<br>26<br>23<br>32<br>37|33<br>33<br>29<br>52<br>53|22<br>20<br>16<br>25<br>28|\n\n_Impact of Long-Term Intensive Cropping on Soil Potassium and Sustainability of Crop Production_ _**179**_\n\n\n(Srinivasa Rao _et al.,_ 1999). The differences were more clear during initial 73\nhours of extraction as compared to release rates for the entire period of\n\nincubation.\n\n\nTen cycles of maize-wheat cropping at Ludhiana substantially reduced the\nnon-exchangeable K especially under higher level of N and P application\nwhereas application of 100 kg K ha [\u20131] decreased the extent of change in nonexchangeable K ( **Fig. 8** ) at Ludhiana (Brar and Pasricha, 1998). Contribution\nof non-exchangeable K towards K uptake by crops as a result of K application\ndecreased from 97% to 81% in a Vertisol at Jabalpur whereas it decreased\nfrom 100% to 27% in an Aeric Haplaquept at Bhubaneswar ( **Table 5** ). Reduction\nin non-exchangeable K under long-term cropping of finger millet-maizecowpea sequence was observed in a Vertic Inceptisol at Coimbatore and under\nsoybean-wheat-cowpea system at Jabalpur. In both the cases reductions were\nof larger magnitude in the absence of K supply (NP treatment) as compared\nto 100% NPK + FYM treatment.

Several studies have\ninvestigated the influence of K fertilization strategies on (Q/I) parameters in\nsoil. These studies, however, did not evaluate the long-term effects of cropping,\nK fertilization and manuring on the Q/I relation in soils. Long-term\nexperiments are an important means for obtaining information on the longterm sustainability of agricultural systems. A knowledge of Q/I relationship\nof potassium in soil together with their distribution in the zone of root\npenetration helps to predict the fate of added K in soil profile as well as\nnature of K supply from subsoil layers to plant K nutrition particularly in\ndeep rooted crops and in formulating sound fertilizer recommendations.\n\n\nLong-term cropping, fertilization, and manuring in a Typic Ustocrept at\nDelhi influenced the K supplying power of the top soil and subsoil layers,\nthe effects being more pronounced on top soil. The highest and lowest values\nof equilibrium activity ratio (AR ek ), labile pool of K (K L ), non-specific or\nimmediately available K ( K 0 ) and specific or difficulty available K (K X )\nwere observed in 100% NPK+FYM and 100% NP plots, respectively at all\ndepths. Despite low AR ek, K L and free energies of exchange for the replacement\nof calcium with potassium ( G) values in control, N and NP plots, maize,\nwheat and cowpea did not show any deficiency symptoms thereby indicating\nthat sufficient K is being released from non-exchangeable K source (Rupa _et_\n_al._, 2001).\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nThe long-term fertiliser experiments being carried out in different\nagroecological regions of India involving diversified intensive cropping\nsystems and soil types have established increasing crop responses to K\napplication, the effects being more pronounced in Alfisols and Inceptisols as\ncompared to Vertisols and Mollisols. Continuous monitoring of available and\nnon-exchangeable K status is extremely important for making sound K\nfertilizer recommendations for sustaining crop productivity in different soil\n\ntypes.\n\n\n_**182**_ _J.S.

However, intensive\nrice farming has led to substantial potassium (K) depletion in soils, undermining\nsoil fertility and crop productivity. This study assessed the impact of different K\nmanagement strategies on soil K dynamics, balance, and crop uptake in a puddled,\ntransplanted rice\u2013rice system in Odisha, India, during dry (December\u2013April) and\nwet (June\u2013October) seasons. The experiment involved nine treatments, including\ncombinations of chemical fertilizers, straw application, and foliar spray, arranged\nin a randomized block design (RBD). Grain yield was significantly higher when\napplying chemical fertilizer and foliar spray (3.9 t ha [\u2212][1] in the dry season and 5.4 t ha [\u2212][1]\nin the wet season) compared to the control (2.7 and 4.2 t ha [\u2212][1], respectively).\nHigher levels of exchangeable and reserve K were retained with chemical fertilizer\napplications, while reduced fertilizer doses combined with straw utilized more\nnon-exchangeable K. The dry season exhibited a greater shift in non-exchangeable\nK, indicative of larger soil K depletion. Treatments combining reduced fertilizer\ndoses with straw yielded a positive K balance, in contrast to the negative balance\nobserved with chemical fertilizers alone. Correlation analyses indicated that reserve\nand non-exchangeable K significantly contributed to maintaining available K levels\nin the soil solution, thereby supporting continuous crop K uptake. These findings\nhighlight the necessity of integrating reserve and non-exchangeable K dynamics\ninto nutrient management strategies to ensure sustainable rice production.\n\n\nKEYWORDS\n\n\npotassium management, rice yield, nutrient dynamics, foliar spray, residue\nincorporation, sustainable agriculture\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n\nRice is an essential crop for global food security, particularly in Asia, where it is a primary\ndietary staple. As one of the leading rice-producing nations, India has approximately 35% of\nits agricultural land for rice cultivation, contributing nearly 40% to the total food grain\nproduction. Despite this significant contribution, rice productivity in India remains suboptimal\ndue to many agronomic and resource-related challenges (Sreekanth et al., 2017; Singh et al.,\n\n2021\n). This disparity necessitates a more sustainable approach to enhancing rice yield while\nensuring soil health and long-term agricultural viability.\n\nPotassium (K), an essential macronutrient, plays a pivotal role in the growth and\nproductivity of rice. It is involved in critical physiological processes such as enzyme activation,\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems) 01 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nMohapatra et al.\b [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311)\n\n\n\nosmoregulation, and photosynthesis, directly influencing yield and\nquality. However, intensive rice farming practices, driven by the need\nto meet the demands of a growing population, have led to substantial\ndepletion of soil K reserves, undermining soil fertility. Studies have\nshown that Indian soils are predominantly deficient in potassium, with\napproximately 50% categorized as K-deficient (Srinivasarao et al., 2011;\nSanyal et al., 2014). The reliance on imported potassic fertilizers,\ncoupled with insufficient application rates, exacerbates this issue,\nleading to a negative soil K balance (Kumar et al., 2018). The\nintroduction of high-yielding rice varieties during the Green\nRevolution further intensified nutrient depletion in soils. It is estimated\nthat rice removes approximately 15 kg of nitrogen (N), 4 kg of\nphosphorus (P 2 O 5 ), and 24 kg of K 2 O per ton of grain produced\n(Attanandana et al., 2010). Despite this, the recommended dose of\npotassic fertilizer for wetland rice in India is only 40\u201360 kg of K 2 O per\nhectare, which is significantly lower than the recommended nitrogen\napplication rates (Saha et al., 2009; Mohapatra et al., 2017). Persistent\nunder application of K fertilizers has led to a negative K balance,\nparticularly in soils subjected to continuous rice cultivation. This\nimbalance not only reduces soil K availability but also affects the uptake\nefficiency of other essential nutrients, thereby limiting crop productivity.\n\nAn emerging challenge in rice production is the depletion of both\nexchangeable and non-exchangeable forms of soil potassium (Das\net al., 2022). Research has indicated that while exchangeable K can\nbe replenished through fertilizer applications, non-exchangeable and\nreserve K contribute significantly to the crop\u2019s nutrient requirements\n(Rao and Srinivas, 2017). Over time, intensive cultivation practices\nhave reduced the soil\u2019s ability to release non-exchangeable K,\nnecessitating alternative management strategies to maintain soil\nfertility (Lalitha and Dhakshinamoorthy, 2014; Alomar and Jena,\n2023). Integrating organic and inorganic nutrient sources has been\nproposed as a sustainable approach to address these challenges. Crop\nresidue incorporation, for instance, not only enhances soil organic\nmatter but also contributes to the slow release of K, thereby improving\nsoil K dynamics. Since 90% of the world\u2019s rice is produced in Asia,\nmanaging rice straw after harvest is crucial to the rice production cycle.\nIn Asia, rice is traditionally harvested by hand, with only a small\namount of straw left in the field, after being cut and carried to a central\nthreshing place for grain and straw separation. Since rice straw was\nregarded as a waste commodity, it was either burned or turned into\nanimal bedding or fodder. However, with the increasing use of combine\nharvesters in the region, large amounts of rice straw are now left in the\nfield. Studies have shown that _in situ_ incorporation of rice straw into\nthe soil enhances nutrient recycling, increases soil organic carbon (C),\nand improves the yields of subsequent crops (Gupta et al., 2007;\nChivenge et al., 2020). Studies have demonstrated that when combined\nwith reduced doses of chemical fertilizers, straw soil application can\nimprove the K balance and maintain soil health (Witt et al., 1999; Hou\net al., 2021). Similarly, foliar application of potassium nitrate has been\nfound to enhance nutrient use efficiency and crop productivity under\nvarious stress conditions (Brar and Brar, 2004; Adhikari et al., 2019).\n\nGiven the critical role of potassium in rice cultivation and the\npressing need for sustainable nutrient management practices, this\nstudy aims to evaluate the effects of different K management strategies\non soil K dynamics, crop uptake, and grain yield in a puddled,\ntransplanted rice\u2013rice cropping system. The experiment, conducted\nin Odisha, India, during dry and wet seasons, included treatments\ncombining chemical fertilizers, straw application, and foliar sprays. By\nanalyzing the contributions of exchangeable, non-exchangeable, and\n\n\n\nreserve K to the overall nutrient supply, this study seeks to provide\ninsights into optimizing potassium management for enhanced\nproductivity and soil health.\n\nThis research addresses key questions relevant to sustainable\nrice farming: How do different potassium management practices\ninfluence soil K dynamics across seasons? What role do\nnon-exchangeable and reserve K play in maintaining soil fertility?\nAnd how can integrated nutrient management approaches\ncontribute to a positive K balance while sustaining high crop\nyields? The findings aim to inform nutrient management strategies\nthat are not only effective but also economically viable and\nenvironmentally sustainable for smallholder rice farmers in India\nand similar agroecological contexts.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n\n2.1 Experimental site and climate\n\n\nThe field experiment was conducted at the Central Research\nStation of Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT),\nBhubaneswar, India (20\u00b015\u2032N, 81\u00b052\u2032E; 25.5 m above sea level), during\nthe dry (December\u2013April) and wet (June\u2013October) seasons. The site\nis in the Eastern and South-Eastern Coastal Plain agroclimatic zone,\ncharacterized by a hot and humid climate. The mean annual rainfall\nis 1,467 mm, approximately 70% occurring between July and\nSeptember. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures are\n33.2\u00b0C and 21.4\u00b0C, respectively. The soil at the site is sandy loam with\na pH of 5.87, medium organic carbon (0.39%), low nitrogen (alkaline\nKMnO 4 -N: 170 kg ha [\u2212][1] ), high phosphorus (0.5-M NaHCO 3 -P:\n21 kg ha [\u2212][1] ), and low exchangeable potassium (1 N NH 4 OAc-K:\n58 kg ha [\u2212][1] ). Non-exchangeable and reserve potassium was measured\nat 123 and 181 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively, in the 0\u201315-cm soil depth. At\n15\u201330- and 30\u201345-cm depths, exchangeable potassium was 59 and\n53 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively, with corresponding increases in\nnon-exchangeable and reserve potassium. As a result of the shallow\nwater table (1 m), the land remains poorly drained during the rainy\nseason but moderately well drained during the summer.\n\n\n2.2 Treatments\n\n\nThe experiment was designed as a randomized block design\n(RBD) with three replications to evaluate nine treatments: T 1 served\nas the control with no potassium application; T 2 involved the\napplication of 40 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] ; T 3 involved 60 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] ; T 4 included\n80 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] ; T 5 combined 20 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] with straw (3 t ha [\u2212][1] ); T 6\nused 30 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] with straw; T 7 combined 40 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] with\nstraw; T 8 incorporated straw alone; and T 9 involved 40 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1]\ncombined with a 1% KNO\u2083 foliar spray at the panicle initiation stage.\nThe treatments were categorized broadly into control (T 1 ), fertilizer K\n(T 2, T 3, and T 4 ), fertilizer K with straw (T 5, T 6, and T 7 ), straw only (T 8 ),\nand fertilizer K with foliar spray (T 9 ).\n\n\n2.3 Crop management\n\n\nThe medium-duration (120\u2013125 days) rice variety \u201cLalat\u201d was used\nin the rice\u2013rice cropping system. The experimental plots measured\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems) 02 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nMohapatra et al.\b [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311)\n\n\n\n6 m \u00d7 5 m, with seedlings (25 days old) transplanted at a 20 cm \u00d7 10 cm\nspacing. Each plot received 30 kg N ha [\u2212][1] (urea), 40 kg P ha [\u2212][1]\n(diammonium phosphate), and 25 kg Zn ha [\u2212][1] (ZnSO\u2084) at transplanting.\nAn additional 50 kg N ha [\u2212][1] was applied in two splits (2:1 ratio) at 20\nand 50 days after transplanting (DAT). Potassium was applied as\nmuriate of potash (MOP) in two equal splits at basal application and\n50 DAT. Weed management included pretilachlor application\n(500 mL ha [\u2212][1] ) at the initial stage, followed by manual weeding as\nneeded. The pest and disease management included applications of\nSAAF (2 g L [\u2212][1] ), streptocycline (0.15 g L [\u2212][1] ), and Furadan (10 kg acre [\u2212][1] ).\n\n\n2.4 Straw addition and management\n\n\nFor treatments involving straw incorporation, panicles were\nremoved, leaving 5 cm of straw, and the field was allowed to dry before\nincorporation. The straw was mixed into the soil using a power tiller\nto a shallow depth, followed by a second plowing after 15 days to\nenhance decomposition. Approximately 3 t ha [\u2212][1] of straw, contributing\n~45 kg K ha [\u2212][1], was incorporated into designated plots.\n\n\n2.5 Soil sampling and analysis\n\n\nSoil samples were collected from three depths\u20140\u201315, 15\u201330, and\n30\u201345 cm\u2014at the beginning of the experiment, mid-season at 30 and\n60 DAT, and after harvest. The collected samples were air-dried,\ncrushed, and sieved through a 2-mm mesh before analysis.\nExchangeable potassium was determined using the ammonium\nacetate method (Hanway and Heidel, 1952), while reserve potassium\nwas extracted with nitric acid following the method developed by\nWood and De Turk (1941). Non-exchangeable potassium was\nmeasured using the procedure described by Black (1965). Soil pH\n(Jackson, 1968), nitrogen content using the alkaline KMnO4 (Subbiah\nand Asija, 1956), and phosphorus using the sodium bicarbonate\nextraction method (Page, 1982) were also analyzed.\n\n\n2.6 Plant sampling and analysis\n\n\nPlant samples were collected at maximum tillering, panicle\ninitiation, and harvest stages. Samples were dried (70 \u00b1 5\u00b0C), weighed,\nand ground using a Willey mill. Potassium content was analyzed at all\ngrowth stages. Grain and straw samples at harvest were digested using\nHNO 3 \u2013HClO 4 (3:2), diluted with distilled water, and analyzed using a\nflame photometer. Phosphorus content was determined using the\nVanadomolybdate yellow color method, and nitrogen was analyzed\nusing the micro-Kjeldahl method.\n\n\n2.7 Statistical analysis\n\n\nData were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Gomez\nand Gomez, 1984; Panse and Sukhatme, 1961). The least significant\ndifference (LSD) at a 0.05 probability level was used to compare\ntreatment means. Correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate\nrelationships between variables, and figures were prepared using\nGRAPES 1.1.0 (Kerela Agriculture University) (Gopinath et al., 2020).\n\n\n## 3 Results\n\n3.1 Grain yield\n\n\nThe K management practices significantly influenced grain yield\nin both dry (DS) and wet (WS) seasons. In the DS, grain yield ranged\nfrom 2.69 t ha [\u2212][1] in the control (T 1 ) to 3.84 t ha [\u2212][1] in T 9, which\ncombined 40 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] with a 1% KNO\u2083 foliar spray (Table 1).\nTreatments T 3, T 4, and T 6 yielded at par with T 9, while other treatments\nproduced significantly lower yields, and in the WS, grain yield varied\nbetween 4.21 t ha [\u2212][1] in T 1 and 5.35 t ha [\u2212][1] in T 9 . The treatment T 9 was\nat par with T 4, T 6, and T 7 and differed significantly from all\nother treatments.\n\n\n3.2 Plant K uptake\n\n\nPotassium uptake by the crop was lower in the DS than that of the\nWS at all growth stages. Maximum K uptake in the DS occurred\nbetween panicle initiation (PI) and harvest, whereas in the WS, the\nuptake was demonstrated to be higher between maximum tillering\n(MT) and PI (Figure 1). In the DS, K uptake at MT ranged from\n16.1 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 8 ) to 19.1 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 9 ), while in the WS, uptake at the\nsame stage ranged from 21.9 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 8 ) to 30.7 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ). At\nharvest, total K uptake in the DS varied between 74 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) and\n147 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ), while in the WS, it ranged from 87 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 and\nT 5 ) to 156 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ).\n\n\n3.3 Exchangeable K\n\n\nExchangeable K levels were generally higher in the DS compared\nto the WS. In the DS, exchangeable K in the surface layer (0\u201315 cm)\nranged from 68.5 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) to 117.8 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ) at MT, whereas in\nthe WS, it ranged from 42.4 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) to 81.7 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 6 ) at the\n\n\nTABLE 1 Effect of different potassium management practices on rice\ngrain yield during the cropping seasons (dry and wet) in the rice\u2013rice\ncropping system.\n\n|Treatment|Grain yield|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Treatment|Dry season|Wet season|\n|K0|2.7|4.2|\n|K40|3.2|4.3|\n|K60|3.5|4.7|\n|K80|3.4|4.9|\n|K20\u00a0+\u202fStraw|3.2|4.4|\n|K30\u00a0+\u202fStraw|3.5|5.2|\n|K40\u00a0+\u202fStraw|3.1|4.9|\n|Straw|2.8|4.6|\n|K40\u00a0+\u202f1% KNO3 spray|3.8|5.4|\n|LSD (0.05)|0.6|0.6|\n\n\n\nT 1 :control (without K application), T 2 :40 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1], T 3 :60 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1], T 4 :80 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1],\nT 5 :20 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] + straw (45 Kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] ), T 6 :30 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] + straw, T 7 :40 kg K 2 O\nha [\u2212][1] + straw, T 8 :straw, and T 9 :40 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] + 1% KNO 3 foliar spray at panicle initiation\n(PI) stage.\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems) 03 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nMohapatra et al.\b [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311)\n\n\nFIGURE 1\nPotassium uptake and partitioning of K at different growth stages in DS and WS.\n\n\n\nsame stage (Figure 2).

At MT in the DS, surface NE-K\n(0\u201315 cm) ranged from 35.5 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 8 ) to 97.9 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T5), while in\nthe subsurface layer (15\u201330 cm), NE-K ranged from 74.5 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 8 ) to\n147.7 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 5 ). In the WS, surface NE-K ranged from 78.8 kg ha [\u2212][1]\n(T 5 ) to 111.2 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 2 ), while subsurface values varied between\n68.0 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) and 140.5 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ) (Figure 3). At harvest in the DS,\nsurface NE-K ranged from 83.3 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T9) to 152.4 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 3 ), while\nsubsurface NE-K varied between 63.6 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 5 ) and 106.2 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 3 ).\nIn the WS, surface NE-K at harvest ranged from 164.7 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) to\n226.2 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ), with subsurface values ranging from 130.6 kg ha [\u2212][1]\n(T 8 ) to 149.5 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 5 ).\n\n\n\n3.5 Reserve K\n\n\nReserve K levels were consistently higher in the DS compared\nto the WS. At MT, reserve K in the DS ranged from 144 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 )\nto 215 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ) in the surface soil (0\u201315 cm), while in the\nsubsurface soil (15\u201330 cm), it ranged from 148 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) to\n215 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ). In the WS, surface reserve K varied from\n124 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) to 173 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ), while in the subsurface layer, it\nranged from 101 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) to 186 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ) (Figure 4). At\nharvest in the DS, reserve K in the surface soil ranged between\n132 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) and 232 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ), while subsurface values\nranged from 156 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 1 ) to 161 kg ha [\u2212][1] (T 4 ).

These\nresults highlight the greater reliance on post-PI K uptake in the DS\ncompared to the WS.\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\n\n4.1 Grain yield and K uptake\n\n\nGrain yield and K uptake were significantly influenced by applying\nK through fertilizers, straw incorporation for two seasons, and foliar\nsprays. The study observed higher grain yields in the wet season (WS)\nthan in the dry season (DS), which can be attributed to differences in\nclimatic conditions and water availability, enhancing nutrient uptake\nefficiency during the WS. Fertilizer treatments with higher K doses or\nfertilizers combined with straw generally resulted in higher yields than\ncontrol or straw-only treatments. This aligns with the findings from\nKumar et al. (2018), who emphasized the positive impact of integrated\nnutrient management on rice productivity.\n\nInterestingly, the partitioning of K uptake varied between\nseasons. In the DS, a larger proportion of K uptake occurred postpanicle initiation (PI), with 59\u201364% of the total K absorbed during\nthis stage, underscoring the importance of late-season K availability.\nConversely, in the WS, K uptake was more evenly distributed across\nthe growth stages, with 38\u201344% absorbed between maximum tillering\nand PI and 40\u201344% between PI and maturity. These patterns\ncorroborate earlier studies by Kumbhar and Sonar (1979) and Kalita\n\n\n\n(2020), highlighting the need for season-specific K management to\noptimize crop uptake and yield.\n\n\n4.2 Changes in soil potassium\n\n\nThe study showed that available K (measured as exchangeable K)\nwas consistently higher in the topsoil than in the subsoil across both\nseasons. However, the DS recorded higher available K levels than the\nWS. This can be attributed to greater K release from soil reserves\nduring the DS, possibly due to soil drying and reduced leaching. As\nobserved in other studies, the decline in available K from the MT to\nPI stage in the surface soil reflects active crop uptake (Lalitha and\nDhakshinamoorthy, 2014). The treatments receiving fertilizers\nmaintained higher available K levels than control or straw-only\ntreatments, demonstrating the efficacy of chemical fertilizers in\nreplenishing soil K. The integration of straw with fertilizers also\nmaintained relatively high available K levels, suggesting that straw\ncontributes to the slow release of K over time, consistent with findings\nby Saha et al. (2009). Incorporation of rice straw has also been\nobserved to improve soil pH, soil organic C, and overall nutrient\ncontent as compared to the initial conditions (Thanh et al., 2016).\n\nNon-exchangeable K played a significant role in maintaining K\navailability during crop growth. The conversion of NE-K to exchangeable\nforms was evident in the DS, where NE-K levels declined at harvest. This\nindicates active soil K release to meet crop demands, particularly under\nintensive cropping conditions due to dynamic equilibrium (Wihardjaka\net al., 2022). The higher NE-K levels recorded in the WS at harvest can\nbe attributed to reduced crop uptake and enhanced K retention due to\nhigher soil moisture levels (Venkateshwarlu et al., 2014). The study\u2019s\nfindings underscore the need to consider NE-K dynamics in nutrient\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems) 06 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nMohapatra et al.\b [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311)\n\n\nFIGURE 5\n\nCorrelation between soil potassium (K) and plant K uptake.\n\n\n\nmanagement strategies, as this form serves as a critical reservoir for\nreplenishing soil K during periods of high crop demand.\n\nReserve K, the most stable form of soil K, showed seasonal\nfluctuations. In both DS and WS, reserve K declined from MT to PI,\nfollowed by an increase at harvest. This pattern suggests the\nmobilization of reserve K to meet crop needs during critical growth\nstages, followed by replenishment through root turnover and\nmicrobial activity. The higher reserve K levels in the WS than those of\nthe DS may reflect enhanced mineral weathering and nutrient cycling\nunder wet conditions. The study also highlighted that fertilizer-only\ntreatments maintained higher reserve K levels than treatments\ninvolving straw, indicating the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers in\nstabilizing this K pool. However, the combined use of fertilizers and\nstraw demonstrated a balanced approach, maintaining adequate\n\n\n\nreserve K while improving soil organic matter, a critical factor for\nlong-term soil health (Witt et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2023).\n\n\n4.3 K balance\n\n\nThe K balance analysis indicated contrasting trends among\ntreatments. Treatments involving straw incorporation, either alone or\nin combination with reduced K fertilizer doses, exhibited positive K\nbalances, indicating sustainable nutrient management. In contrast,\ntreatments relying solely on chemical fertilizers recorded negative K\nbalances (Mohapatra et al., 2023), highlighting the risk of soil K\ndepletion under intensive farming. These findings are consistent with\nearlier studies by Wihardjaka et al. (1999) and Balik et al. (2019),\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems) 07 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nMohapatra et al.\b [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311)\n\n\nTABLE 2 Effect of potassium (K) management practices on K balance during dry and wet seasons in the rice\u2013rice cropping system.\n\n|Treatment|K added (kg ha\u22121)|Col3|Col4|K removed (kg ha\u22121)|Col6|Col7|Balance<br>(kg ha\u22121)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Treatment|Dry season|Wet season|Total|Dry season|Wet season|Total|Total|\n|K0|30|27|57|74|87|160|\u2212103|\n|K40|70|66|137|100|97|197|\u221260|\n|K60|90|86|176|117|148|265|\u221287|\n|K80|110|106|216|147|156|303|\u221286|\n|K20\u00a0+\u202fStraw|50|47|97|21|23|44|53|\n|K30\u00a0+\u202fStraw|60|57|116|24|27|52|65|\n|K40\u00a0+\u202fStraw|70|67|137|20|28|48|89|\n|Straw|30|26|56|22|23|46|11|\n|K40\u00a0+\u202f1% KNO3 spray|72|68|141|139|142|281|\u2212140|\n\n\n\nT 1 :control (without K application), T 2 :40 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1], T 3 :60 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1], T 4 :80 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1], T 5 :20 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] + straw (45 Kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] ), T 6 :30 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] + straw, T 7 :40 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] + straw,\nT 8 :straw, and T 9 :40 kg K 2 O ha [\u2212][1] + 1% KNO 3 foliar spray at panicle initiation (PI) stage.\n\n\n\nemphasizing the importance of integrating organic amendments to\noffset nutrient mining.\n\nThe annual K balance ranged from \u2212140 kg ha [\u2212][1] in the treatment\nwith 40 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] and foliar spray to +89 kg ha [\u2212][1] in the treatment\ncombining 40 kg K\u2082O ha [\u2212][1] with straw. This stark contrast underscores\nthe critical role of straw in mitigating K losses and enhancing nutrient\nrecycling. The positive K balance observed with straw-based\ntreatments also aligns with the findings of Chivenge et al. (2020), who\nreported improved nutrient cycling and soil fertility with residue\nincorporation in rice systems. The rice straw also provides a substrate\nto promote biodiversity through the flourishing of invertebrates that\ndecompose the straw, which in turn enhances nutrient cycling in\npaddy soils (Schmidt et al., 2015).\n\n\n4.4 Implications for sustainable nutrient\nmanagement\n\n\nThe results of this study have significant implications for\ndeveloping sustainable nutrient management strategies in rice-based\ncropping systems. First, the findings highlight the need to integrate\ninorganic and organic nutrient sources to optimize soil K dynamics\nand crop productivity. While chemical fertilizers are effective in\nmaintaining high levels of exchangeable and reserve K, the inclusion\nof straw or other organic amendments enhances soil organic matter,\nimproves nutrient cycling, and ensures long-term soil fertility. This\nintegrated approach is particularly relevant for smallholder farmers,\nwho face resource constraints and rely heavily on soil fertility for\nsustained crop production (Adhikari et al., 2019).\n\nSecond, the study underscores the importance of considering\n\nNE-K and reserve K in nutrient recommendations. Current fertilizer\nrecommendations often focus on exchangeable K, overlooking the\ncontributions of these less available forms. Incorporating NE-K and\nreserve K into nutrient management strategies can help maintain soil\nK reserves and ensure a continuous supply of K to crops, particularly\nunder intensive farming conditions.\n\nThird, the seasonal variations in K dynamics observed in this study\nhighlight the need for season-specific nutrient management. In the DS,\nstrategies should focus on enhancing late-season K availability to\nsupport the high demand during the reproductive phase. In the WS, a\n\n\n\nmore balanced approach that ensures steady K availability throughout\nthe growing season may be more effective. Tailoring nutrient\nmanagement practices to seasonal requirements can improve nutrient\nuse efficiency, reduce losses, and contribute to sustainable intensification.\n\nFinally, the positive K balance achieved with straw-based\ntreatments highlights the potential of residue recycling as a costeffective and environmentally friendly alternative to chemical\nfertilizers. Farmers can reduce their dependence on external inputs by\nreturning crop residues to the soil, lowering production costs, and\nmitigating environmental impacts associated with fertilizer use.\nHowever, the study also points to the need for appropriate\nmanagement practices, such as ensuring adequate decomposition of\nstraw before planting, to maximize its benefits.\n\n\n4.5 Future research directions\n\n\nWhile this study provides valuable insights, several areas warrant\nfurther investigation. Long-term studies are needed to assess the\ncumulative effects of different K management strategies on soil health,\ncrop productivity, and environmental sustainability. In addition, research\nshould explore the potential of other organic amendments, such as green\nmanures and composts, to enhance K dynamics and support sustainable\nrice production. The interactions between K and other nutrients, such\nas nitrogen and phosphorus, also merit further study to optimize\nnutrient management in rice-based systems. Finally, there is a need for\nsocioeconomic studies to evaluate the feasibility and adoption of\nintegrated nutrient management practices among smallholder farmers.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\n\nThis study highlights the pivotal role of potassium (K) management\nstrategies in maintaining soil K dynamics and sustaining rice productivity\nin a rice\u2013rice cropping system. Integrating inorganic fertilizers with\norganic amendments, such as rice straw, emerges as a viable approach to\nachieving a positive K balance while enhancing soil fertility. Chemical\nfertilizers effectively maintain higher levels of exchangeable and reserve\nK, supporting immediate crop uptake. Conversely, treatments\nincorporating straw with reduced K fertilizer doses contribute to the\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems) 08 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nMohapatra et al.\b [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1453311)\n\n\n\nmobilization of non-exchangeable K, ensuring a steady nutrient supply\nduring critical growth stages. Seasonal variations in K dynamics were\nevident, with the dry season showing greater depletion of soil K reserves,\nnecessitating targeted nutrient management to address this challenge.\nTreatments combining straw and reduced K fertilizer doses demonstrated\na sustainable balance, minimizing nutrient losses and mitigating soil\ndegradation. These findings underscore the importance of including\nnon-exchangeable and reserve K in nutrient management\nrecommendations to ensure long-term soil health and productivity.\nAdopting integrated nutrient management strategies tailored to specific\nseasonal requirements can optimize nutrient use efficiency, reduce\nexternal input dependency, and promote sustainable rice cultivation,\nparticularly for resource-constrained smallholder farmers. Future studies\nshould focus on the long-term implications of such strategies on soil and\ncrop health.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will\nbe made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\n## Author contributions\n\n\nSM: Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review &\nediting, Investigation, Visualization.

Lipavsk\u00fd**\n\n\n_Crop Research Institute, Prague, Czech Republic_\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nDynamics of the plant-available potassium (K) has been studied in polyfactorial long-term fertilization experiments\nsince 1980. The fertilization scheme includes 10 combinations of K muriate and farmyard manure application rates\n(annually 0\u2013230 kg K/ha). At medium treatment (annually 153 kg K/ha), the K balance within an 8-year crop rotation reflected crop specific K application rates with positive annual balances in years of growing silage maize and\nsugar beet (high K input), and negative in two years of growing alfalfa. Available K clearly corresponded to the dynamics of the K balance, with statistically significant fluctuations from 88 to 149 mg K/kg within one crop rotation\ncycle. Periodic fluctuations of available K induced by crop rotation were observed also in non-fertilized treatments.\nThe variability of available K contents was influenced primarily by crop plants and experimental unexplained factors; interannual weather fluctuations and field differences were of low significance. In the paper, the importance of\ninterannual K dynamics for the construction of correct long-term time trends is shown and discussed.\n\n\n**Keywords** : long-term experiments; potassium; soil; nutrient balance; crop rotation\n\n\n\nLong-term fertilization experiments provide\nan opportunity for experimentation in which the\neffects of manipulation may be separated from\nother variables (Southwood 1994). The value\nof long-term trials, even though nowadays it is\nquestioned, is irreplaceable \u2013 the long-term trials are the basic platform for examination and\nquantification of cultivation-based changes in\nagro-ecosystems and enable the evaluation of the\neffects of long-term different intensity of fertilization on nutrient dynamics (Merbach and Deubel\n2008). In many European countries, the oldest\nlong-term experiments are still being maintained\nand provide essential information for agriculture\nand environmental science.\n\n\nIn the Czech Republic, most of the long-term\nfield experiments had been founded and maintained\nby the Crop Research Institute (CRI), Prague. The\noldest trials were established in 1955 in PragueRuzyn\u011b. The trials were maintained at twelve sites\ndiffering in soil and climatic conditions. The main\nexperimental factors investigated were crop nutrition, crop rotation, cultivation technologies and\norganic manuring (for an overview see Lipavsk\u00fd\net al. 2005).\n\n\n\nAn important question that can be answered with\nthe help of long-term trials is the one concerning\nthe long-term effects of contemporary K management. Fertilizer and manure application rates and\ntiming are based on the optimal nitrogen rate and\nnot on K requirements (Oborn et al. 2005). In addition, changes in the structure and financing of\nthe agronomic sector in the Czech Republic that\noccurred after 1989, accompanied with continuous\nincrease of input costs led to a dramatic drop in\nthe use of K mineral fertilizers. The actual average\nannual application rate is 8 kg/ha of mineral K\nand 17 kg K in manures (Anonymous 2007), that\nis only 15% of the application rate before 1989.\nIn this type of management, K balance becomes\nhighly negative \u2013 outputs are higher than inputs\nand K is released from internal soil sources.\n\n\nThe issue of sustainable soil K management was\npartly ignored during the last few decades while\nthe potential environmental impact of agricultural\nuse of nitrogen and phosphorus was considered a\nmore important problem (Simonsson et al. 2007).\nFrom this viewpoint, trial plots with low or zero\nK inputs are of special interest within long-term\nK fertilization trials. They can provide essential\n\n\n\nSupported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic, Project No. MZE 0002700604.\n\n\n**334** Plant Soil Environ., _55_, 2009 (8): 334\u2013343\n\n\nTable 1.

Until now, large datasets taken within the\nexperiments were only processed partially and no\ncomprehensive works have been published. In this\narticle we evaluate K inputs/outputs and plantavailable K data as a base for analysis of long-term\ntrends. The aim of the article is to evaluate the\n\ndynamics of available K and discuss its importance\nas related to the construction of correct time trends\n\nin cases of timely non-regular soil sampling.\n\n\n**Material and methods**\n\n\nPolyfactorial field experiments were originally\nestablished at 9 sites representing different pedo\n\n\nand climasequences of the arable soils in the Czech\nRepublic. For each experiment, a central scheme\nof the second order design in incomplete blocks\nwas used, according to Cochran and Cox (1957).\nAt each site the trial consisted of four fields, each\nconsisting of 56 plots of 5 \u00d7 12 m, designed in 4\nrows. Within the scheme, the influence of 6 independent factors was tested. Some factors were\naltered during the experiment (Table 1).\n\nFive levels corresponding to each factor were\nset up in a manner that medium level reflected\nstandard agricultural cropping practice, specific\nfor each crop-plant, and the highest level was\nsupposed to limit plant growth by the excess of\nthe nutrient (or by very high stand density). Zero\nlevel means no use of the fertilizer, except in the\ncase of stand density where some low density was\nchosen. Between the medium and extreme levels,\ntwo other levels (higher, lower) were set up, of\nwhich the \u2018higher\u2019 was supposed to be optimal or\n\n\n\nTable 2.

The influence of the\nfactors was investigated in 8-year crop rotation\n(Table 2), including 50% of cereals, potato/sugar\nbeet, silage maize and clover/alfalfa (depending\non the climate conditions of the site). In fields,\nrotation was phased in 2-year shifts.\n\nWithin trials at given sites each field originally\nconsisted of 47 different treatments. 10 plots had\nthe same treatment with all factors at medium level.\n\nThis set of 10 equally treated plots was used for the\ncalculation of variability parameters because all\nother treatments were not replicated within a given\nfield. 32 treatments had different combinations of\n\n\u2018higher\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 levels, 12 treatments had all\nfactors at medium level and always had one of the\nfactors at \u2018zero\u2019 or \u2018excess\u2019 level. One treatment\n\nhad all factors at zero level (i.e. \u2018not treated\u2019) and\nthe last treatment had all factors at zero level and\nthe 6 [th] factor at the \u2018excess\u2019 level. This treatment\n\nwas changed to \u2018not treated\u2019 after 1995.\n\nThis set of treatments was the same for all four\n\nfields, which differed only in the distribution of\ntreatments within the field. It means that the ma\njority of treatments were replicated four times.\n\nN fertilizers were used in the form of ammonium\n\nnitrate or ammonium sulphate; P as super-phosphate; K as K muriate and Mg in the form of Mg\nsulphate.\n\nAfter harvest (except in the second year of alfalfa/clover), soil samples (consisting of 5\u20138 subsamples within the plot) of plough horizon (depth\nof 0\u201320 cm) were taken and analyzed for soil reaction, organic carbon content, total nitrogen and\navailable nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg). Plant material\n\n\n\nfrom each harvest was analyzed for total content\nof N, P, K, Ca and Mg after wet combustion.\n\nThe consistency of the experiments was disturbed\nby several factors, mostly connected with financial\nissues following 1989. The main changes were: the\ntermination of 4 experimental sites, changes in\nthe crop rotation at some fields and a reduction\nof soil sampling.\n\nThe analytical method of available K determination was also changed. The formerly used method\nof ammonium acetate/oxalate extraction (according to Schachtschabel, in Hra\u0161ko et al. 1962) was\nreplaced by Mehlich II/III extraction. In this case\ndata were transformed back to Schachtschabel\n\naccording to the equations below.\n\n\nK Sch = 0.8187 \u00d7 K M II + 3.94;\n\n\nK = 0.712 \u00d7 K + 9.96.\nSch M III\n\n\nThese equations were derived from analyses\nof a large number of soil samples (based on data\npublished by the Central Institute for Supervising\nand Testing in Agriculture, Tr\u00e1vn\u00edk 2008). K balances were calculated as the difference between\n\nK input (in farmyard manure and mineral K) and\nK output by harvested plant material. K leaching\nand atmospherical deposition were not taken into\n\naccount.\n\n\nData presented and discussed originate from\nthe experiment at Hn\u011bv\u010deves. Data from Kostelec,\nHumpolec and Pernolec are shown in a lesser extent, with the aim to demonstrate the differences\namong the experiments at different sites.\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Mach\u00e1\u010dek\net al. (2001) reported that the annual balance in\ncommon agricultural practice ranges from minus\n75 to minus 185 kg K/ha at low or zero K inputs.\nThe correlation between K input and K balance\nis highly significant ( _R_ _[2]_ = 0.99, _n_ = 10). Zero balance was obtained at the annual input of 163 kg\nK/ha.\n\n\nThe scheme of the experiment allows 10 combinations of farmyard manure (FYM) and K muriate\napplication rates, which would theoretically give\n10 different overall K application rates (marked\nwith letters A\u2013J in Table 4). Some combinations\nof levels give nearly the same overall K application\nrates and a similar K balance. The same application\nrate obtained by different combinations of FYM\nand K muriate levels allows a rough comparison\nof the degree of utilization of FYM and mineral K.\nAt low application rates (combinations B and C);\nthe difference between the outputs of K suggests\nbetter utilization of K from muriate than that\n\nfrom FYM. When taking into account the uptake\nfrom fertilizer (which was calculated as K uptake\nat the particular treatment minus K uptake at no\nfertilized control), crops utilized 44% of mineral\nfertilizer (combination C), and only 9% of K from\nFYM (combination B), on average.\n\n\n\nAt higher application rates the data do not indicate that one of the potassium forms has better\nutilization by crops than another. At the highest\napplication rates, the degree of utilization of both\nFYM and mineral K (combinations G, H, I) is very\nlow (22\u201325%). Reduced effectiveness of fertilizer\nK suggests that plant growth and yield formation\nis limited by other nutrients (e.g. N, P and Mg;\nBlake et al. 1999).\n\nManuring with FYM supplies soil with high inputs of organic matter and nutrients twice during\na rotation cycle (for sugar beet and silage maize).\nDespite the high K demand of these crops, K input by FYM and K muriate is usually higher than\nK uptake. Only exceptionally, in very favorable\nweather conditions, K output by a high yield of\nsugar beet may compensate for high K input. Thus,\nthe curve of K balance has two positive peaks in\nthe 4 [th] and 7 [th] year of the rotation (Figure 1) in\nfertilized treatments. On the contrary, the high\nK uptake of these crops in non-fertilized treatments causes a clear drop down of the balance\nin these years.\n\nThe growing of alfalfa (first two years of the\nrotation) causes high negative balances in all treatments regardless of the application rate. K fertilizer,\ntogether with N and P, is used only before sowing of alfalfa and oat to stimulate plant growth.\nAfterwards, alfalfa stand was not fertilized and a\nlarge biomass export associated with several cuttings was not compensated for by any input.

Hn\u011bv\u010deves, based\n\non 1980\u20131992 data\n\n\nlowest balance was found in the treatments of the\nhighest application rate in the 2 [nd] year, suggesting\nthe lack of K limited the yields of alfalfa.\n\nFurther results and discussion on available K\n\nduring one crop rotation are related to data of\nmedium application rate (combination E), mainly\nfor two reasons: (1) 10 replications of this treatment within each field allow for sufficient statis\ntical evaluation, and (2) we can assume that no\nlong-term changes of soil K are due to a nearly\nzero balance.\n\n\nThe dynamics of the available K within crop rotation corresponds clearly to the dynamics of K balance\n(Figure 2); even the amplitude of changes is not as\nhigh. Despite quite high variability of the available K\ncontents, many of the between-year differences are\nstatistically significant. The mean for whole rotation cycle is 116 mg K/kg. The lowest contents of\navailable K are connected with the negative balance\nin the first two years of the rotation, with minimum\ncontent of 88 mg K/kg in the second year. Because\nforage crops take up a substantial amount of K from\nthe subsoil (41\u201367%, Witter and Johansson 2001),\nthe decrease of available K is not as steep as can\nbe expected from the K balance.\n\nAvailable K contents after winter wheat harvest\nin the 3 [rd] year (93 mg K/kg) are not significantly\ndifferent from that in the second year and that\nlogically corresponds to a nearly zero balance\n(\u201313 kg K/ha/year). The positive balance in the\n4 [th] year of crop rotation (silage maize) increased\n\n\n\nFigure 2. K balance and available K dynamics within a\ncrop rotation cycle.

Different letters\nindicate significantly different averages ( _P_ < 0.05)\n\n\navailable K to 125 mg K/kg, and this increasing\ntrend lasted to the 5 [th] year (130 mg K/kg), despite\na slightly negative balance. The second important\nincrease of available K occurred after sugar beet\n(year 7), where the curve of available K in the\nrotation reached a maximum of 149 mg K/kg. In\nthe last year of the rotation, the available K contents dropped down to 116 mg/kg even though\nthe balance was not negative. This drop can only\nbe explained as K-loss to subsoil by leaching or\nK fixation into non-available forms.\n\n\nAnnual K balances influence available K to a large\nextent also at other sites. \u2018Two-peak\u2019 character of\nthe available K curve is a common feature of all the\n\nexperimental sites (Figure 3). Different positions\nof the curve (different mean level of available K)\nare connected with different nutrient status at\n\nthe beginning of experiments and probably also\nwith soil properties (e.g. clay content and quality,\ncation exchange capacity).\n\nPolyfactorial field experiments were designed\nfor analyses of the influence of defined factors and\nfor investigation of time trends caused by various\napplication rates of fertilizers. This experimental\ndesign has limited possibilities to evaluate other influences. Even though we realize some constraints,\nwe made attempts to provide an evaluation of the\nfactors affecting available K variability.\n\nWe can distinguish three known sources of\navailable K variability within the experiment: (1)\nvariability given by the growing of different crops\n\n\n\n**338** Plant Soil Environ., _55_, 2009 (8): 334\u2013343\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n100\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\n\n180\n\n\n160\n\n\n140\n\n\n120\n\n\n100\n\n\n80\n\n\n60\n\n\n\nYear of crop rotation Year of crop rotation\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

The latter is supposed to be minimum; because\nan important assumption of the experiment is that\nthere are no inner (soil, site) differences among\nfields of a particular site.\n\nResults of the main factors \u2018Crop\u2019, \u2018Weather\u2019\nand \u2018Field\u2019 are shown in Table 5. All factors have\n\nstatistically significant influence on available K.\nBy comparing the sum of squares, it is clear that\nthe influence of crop factor (34% of total) on data\nvariability is much higher than the influence of\nweather and field factors (3%). Residual unexplained variability is high (42%), pointing to the\nexistence of other unknown factors affecting available K data (e.g. soil, sampling and analytical variability). All factors combined explain 58% of the\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Jouany\net al. (1996) reported that for a given treatment,\ndifferences between two successive sampling dates\nare sometimes larger than differences between\ntreatments for a given date. Authors consider that\nthis variability is caused by water content at sampling and drying and subsequent release or fixation\nof K. Merbach and Deubel (2007) reported data of\n\n\n\nTable 5.

For medium and excess\napplication rates, the curves had typical two-peak\ncharacter within all rotation cycles and the lowest\navailable K contents were always present after the\nsecond year of alfalfa.\n\nA very interesting phenomenon is the periodic\nchange of available K content in the non-fertilized\ntreatment. Changes follow the crop rotation cycle\nbut the relation to K balance is not as clear as in the\n\ncase of fertilized treatments. Generally, the balance\nis more negative in the first half of the cycle than\nin the second half (Figure 1), when excluding the\nbalance of the 7 [th] year. This corresponds to lower\nK contents in the first half of the rotation cycle.\nHowever, the balance in the year of sugar beet\ncropping is even more negative than for alfalfa,\nbut soil K contents stay at a higher level.\n\nThis phenomenon might be connected with\nthe physiology of the sugar beet. It is known that\nsugar beet is more effective in uptake of fixed soil\nK then cereals (El Dessougi et al. 2002) and due\n\n\n\nto a deep root system it takes large portions of K\nfrom deeper horizons. Simultaneously, K balance\nincludes whole soil profile and only a portion of the\nK uptake originated in a plough layer. Decreases of\nthe soil K pool are often found to be smaller than\nthe calculated total deficit of K from the cropping\nsystems based on the accumulated field balances\n(Andrist-Rangel et al. 2007). Anyway, it is unlikely\nthat a crop with high K demands will not affect K\ncontents in plough layer. Another possible explanation may be that high contents are related to the\nmethod of sampling. After the harvest of sugar\nbeet, deeper soil horizons with a higher K content\nmay mix with the plough (sampling) layer, consequently increasing measured K contents. Some\nside transfer of more fertilized soil from adjacent\nfertilized plots is also possible, even though the\nagrotechnics is done carefully to minimize the\nsoil translocation. Thorough explanation deserves\nfurther attention and verification of data.\n\n\nIn papers evaluating soil properties in long-term\nexperiments, the most usual ways of presenting the\ntime series are calculating means for some period\nof years or showing values of regular sampling with\nconstant periodicity of several years. If sampling is\nonly occasional, data are collected non-regularly\nand then trends have to be evaluated by comparison\nof these isolated data. In the case of our data, some\nof the treatments were sampled almost regularly\nin periodicity of 1 or 2 years (combinations A, B,\nC, E, I and J). For these data, trend evaluation is\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n\n50\n\n\n0\n\n\nFigure 5. Available K contents during the experiment.

This reveals evident\nproblems of how to compare these data and to\nconstruct time trends. 1988 is the 7 [th] year of the\ncrop rotation, year 1995 is the 6 [th] and year 2007\nis the 2 [nd] year of the crop rotation. The problem\nof comparing data is that means of the 2 [nd], the\n6 [th] and the 7 [th] year differ significantly from each\nother (see Figure 2).\n\nThe direct comparison of values and calculating\ntime trends are therefore not correct for treat\nments with combinations of application rates\nD, F, G and H, which were sampled only in the\nabove-mentioned years. In this case, data should\nbe adjusted to the same level. We decided to use\nyear 2007 (the 2 [nd] year of crop rotation) to recalculate values from years 1988 and 1995. We used\na ratio between average K content of the 2 [nd] and\nthe 6 [th] year of crop rotation (0.72) to adjust data\nfrom year 1995 and the ratio between the 2 [nd] and\nthe 7 [th] year of crop rotation (0.59) to adjust data\nfrom year 1988. For other combinations of application rates, contents in years 1983, 1991 and\n1999 were taken to calculate time trends (the 2 [nd]\nyear of crop rotation).\n\n\n\nData used for the construction of time trends\n\nand calculated slopes are shown in Table 6. For\na given combination of application rates, a slope\nof the regression line was calculated from 4 time\npoints. Between regression trends, calculated from\nadjusted and non-adjusted contents, are important\ndifferences. Calculated slopes of time trends can\nbe approximately the same (combination F), but\nmay differ in absolute values (combination H) or\ncan even indicate a different direction of time\n\nchanges (combination D).\n\nThe highest slopes correspond to annual increases more than 2 mg K/kg (ca 1.5% of available\nK content) and were detected for combinations H\nand J. At the same time, variations caused by growing of different crops were found in the range of\n88\u2013149 mg K/kg, i.e. \u00b1 26% of the mean. It implies\nthat interannual increases caused by long-term\ntrends are of much lower extent (order of magnitude\nlower) than K variability caused by crops.\n\nSlopes are highly correlated with K balance\n(Figure 6, correlation is statistically significant\nat _P_ < 0.05). From the regression equation it can\nbe calculated that a zero slope, i.e. a stabilized\navailable K level, corresponds to an average annual\nK balance of minus 78 kg K/ha. It means that, for\nexample, at an application rate of 77 kg K and a\nmedium application rate of nitrogen and phospho\n\n\nTable 6. Available K contents during the experiment (mg K/kg).

Relationship between K balances and slopes\n\nof time trends of available K contents. Hn\u011bv\u010deves site\n\n\nrus (combination C), soil K will be continuously\nreplenished from soil sources at an annual rate\nof 79 kg K/ha to keep the same level of ca. 76 mg\nK/kg (in long-term view).\n\nWe would like to pinpoint one interesting consequence that arises from calculated long-term\ntrends. In soils of high starting available K, substantial changes in available K content at plough\nlayer may occur after two 8-year rotations (decrease\nfrom ca 250 mg K/kg by 121 mg K/kg; Lauringson\net al. 2004). In the soil of Hn\u011bv\u010deves, which had\nmuch lower starting available K (119 mg K/kg), the\ndecrease of available K in non-fertilized treatments\n\nwas not as steep (up to 65 mg K/kg in 2007) and\nthe available K contents stayed at approximately\nthe same level (48\u201365 mg K/kg) during the last\n20 years, at an annual balance minus 122 kg K per\nhectare. If we consider the average bulk density of\nplough layer to be 1.3 Mg/m [3] and the thickness of\nplough layer to be 25 cm, 1 mg/kg available K is then\nequal to 2.5 kg K/ha. Therefore, in non-fertilized\nplots, soil sources other than those extracted for\navailable K, release annually ca 50 mg K/kg.\n\nAs was previously mentioned, the balance covers\nthe whole soil profile and therefore this comparison\nis not fully correct, as we did not analyze subsoil\navailable K contents. However, it is obvious that\navailable K is continuously restored. The reason\nof this restoration is K mobilization from slow\n\nrelease forms. K is replenished by (1) the weathering of mineral soil particles (annually 3\u201382 kg\nK/ha depending on soil properties; Holmqvist et\nal. 2003), and (2) by the release of fixed (reserve)\n\n\n\nK pool, the content of which is in average 3-times\nlarger than that of available K (Fotyma 2007). Even\nthough we did not analyze the pool of fixed K in\nthe soils at Hn\u011bv\u010deves, we expect that the rate of\nK output was high enough to cause substantial\ndepletion of fixed K.\n\nNowadays, our crop production depends highly\non the mobilization of internal soil K sources.\n\nNegative K balance is a reality and probably also a\nfuture aspect of our agriculture; the change of this\ntrend cannot be expected in the near future. The\nannual K application rate should increase manifold\n(to level ca 170 kg K/ha) to reach stabilization of\navailable K. Moreover, prices of K fertilizers are\nincreasing, contrary to prices of agricultural products. Farmers will not be motivated to use K fer\ntilizers until soil sources are exhausted. Attention\n\nshould be therefore focused on the extent of these\n\nsources and the sustainability of their continuous\nexploitation. Understanding and quantifying K\nmobilization processes is one of the important\nchallenges for future research.\n\nObserved interannual dynamics of soil K are driven by agricultural management and of course are\nspecific for a particular type of that management,\ncrops in rotation, fertilization practices, and soil\nand site properties. The crop rotation used in our\ntrial is probably more K-demanding than the others.\nHowever, results have important consequences for\nevaluation of long-term data not only from these\nstatic fertilization experiments, but also for data taken\nwithin large (national) soil monitoring programs.\nIn occasionally sampled sites or when the period of\nsampling is several years, agricultural management\nhas to be inevitably known. Otherwise, construction\nof time trends will be strongly affected by short-term\ninfluences. The impact of the management could\ninadvertently cover up long term trends and finally,\nthe results would not reflect real time trends.\n\nWithin the long term polyfactorial fertilization\nexperiments, periodic interannual fluctuations\nof available K were observed, with statistically\nsignificant differences from 88 to 149 mg K/kg\nwithin one crop rotation cycle. These fluctuations\nwere driven by the dynamics of the K balance that\noriginated mainly in crop-specific K inputs. The\nvariability of soil-K contents was primarily influenced by crop plants and experimental unexplained\nfactors; interannual weather fluctuations and field\ndifferences were of low significance.\n\n\n\n**342** Plant Soil Environ., _55_, 2009 (8): 334\u2013343\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAndrist-Rangel Y., Edwards A.C., Hillier S., Oborn I.\n(2007): Long-term K dynamics in organic and conventional mixed cropping systems as related to management and soil properties.

Soil & Water Res., 13: 200\u2212207.\n\n\nNon-exchangeable K release can greatly influence soil K fertility. This study was carried out to study the release\nof non-exchangeable K from 22 surface and subsurface soils of southern Iran using successive extraction with\n10 mmol/l of CaCl 2 and oxalic acid in a period of 2\u22121368 h at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Alfisols, Aridisols, Entisols, Inceptisols,\nMollisols, and Histosols were among the studied soil orders. Illite, smectite, chlorite, vermiculite, kaolinite and\npalygorskite clay minerals were identified. The amount of non-exchangeable K varied from 95 to 506 mg/kg. Re\u00ad\nsults showed that CaCl 2 and oxalic acid released 60 and 55% of non-exchangeable K from soils, respectively. The\ndiscontinuity in slope was found when the cumulative amount of released K was plotted versus time, supporting\nthe multi-reactive nature of K exchange sites. The cumulative K release in soils ranged from 87 to 300 mg/kg for\nCaCl 2 and 78 to 300 mg/kg for oxalic acid which was well described by simplified Elovich and power function\nequations. The _b_ constant of simplified Elovich as an index of non-exchangeable K release rate was in the range of\n10 to 36 mg/kg for CaCl 2 and 11 to 36 mg/kg for oxalic acid. The highest _b_ constant was measured in Inceptisols\nand Alfisols, while the lowest values were found in Entisols and Histosols. In conclusion, the K release pattern was\nsimilar for both extractants and affected by clay content and type, and soil depth.\n\n\n**Keywords** : calcium chloride; clay mineralogy; kinetic equations; organic acid\n\n\n\nPotassium, as the seventh most frequent element\nof the Earth crust (2.6% of weight), is an essential\nnutrient for humans, animals, and plants. Soil potas\u00ad\nsium could be divided into soluble, exchangeable,\nnon-exchangeable, and structural forms. The major\nproportion of soil potassium is structural (90\u201398%),\nwhereas soluble and exchangeable (0.1\u20132%) and nonexchangeable potassium (2\u201310%) constitute only\na small portion of total soil K. Non-exchangeable\nK is released to exchangeable forms to meet plant\nneeds of potassium (Sparks & Huang 1985). Mar\u00ad\ntin and Sparks (1983) suggested that the release\nof K from non-exchangeable to exchangeable form\ncould be limited when the concentration of K in the\n\nsoil solution exceeds 1 mmol/l. Wang _et al_ . (2011)\n\n\n**200**\n\n\n\nshowed that the critical level of soluble K for the\n\nrelease of non-exchangeable K could be related to\nthe type of clay minerals and content of Ca [2+] and\nNa [+] in the soil solution. Jalali (2006) stated that\nthe calcareous soils of Iran containing sufficient\nexchangeable K and K-bearing minerals are capable\nof releasing sufficient K for optimal plant produc\u00ad\ntion. However, exchangeable K is not always a reli\u00ad\nable estimation of plant availability of potassium in\ncalcareous soils. The interaction of soil mineralogy,\ntextural characteristics, and biological processes\nmay influence the release of potassium in different\nsoil orders (Simonsson _et al_ . 2007). Therefore, the\nresearch on the rate of non-exchangeable K release\nseems necessary in such soils.\n\n\n_Soil & Water Res., 13, 2018 (4): 200\u2013207_ _Original Paper_\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.17221/138/2017-SWR\n\n\n\nSeveral equations including zero order, first order,\nElovich, parabolic diffusion, and power function have\nbeen used to describe the kinetics of non-exchange\u00ad\nable K release and to evaluate soil K availability for\nplant growth (Srinivasarao _et al_ . 2006; Wang _et_\n_al_ . 2011). Jalali and Khanlari (2014) described the\n\nK release from some calcareous soils of western Iran\n\nusing Elovich, parabolic diffusion and power function\nequations. Hosseinpur and Motaghian (2013)\nstudied the release of non-exchangeable K from 10 cal\u00ad\ncareous soils of central Iran using 10 mmol/l CaCl 2 .\nThey reported that the release of non-exchangeable\nK was well described by parabolic diffusion, power\nfunction and simplified Elovich. The _b_ constant of\nkinetic equations clearly showed the release rate of\nnon-exchangeable K and its availability.\n\nMany crops, especially deep-rooted crops, can\nobtain a substantial amount of K from lower layers\nof soils, but the release of non-exchangeable K in\nsubsoil samples has been investigated to a lesser\nextent. We hypothesized that soil physicochemical\nproperties and clay mineralogy are quite different\nin various soil orders and soil depths, which in turn\naffect the release of non-exchangeable K related to\nsoil classification. Data about non-exchangeable K\ncontent and its release related to clay minerals and\nsoil development are highly valuable for fertility man\u00ad\nagement of soils. However, limited data are available\nfor soils of southern Iran. The aims of the present\nresearch were to study: (1) the non-exchangeable K\nrelease rate in 22 surface and subsurface soils with\n\ndifferent clay mineralogy and soil properties using\nCaCl 2 and oxalic acid extractants, and (2) the rela\u00ad\n\n\n\ntionship between K release rate and selected phys\u00ad\nicochemical properties and clay mineralogy of soils.\n\n\n**MATERIAL AND METHODS**\n\n\n**Study area and sampling of soils** . The study area\nis located in Fars Province, southern Iran (Figure 1).\nThe mean annual temperature and precipitation were\n17\u00b0C and 339 mm, respectively. The area was clas\u00ad\nsified as semi-arid region with xeric moisture and\nthermic temperature regimes. Forty pedons were\nstudied and eleven representative pedons (Figure 1)\nwere selected for physicochemical, morphological,\nand clay mineralogical studies.\n\n**Physicochemical properties** . Particle size distri\u00ad\nbution was identified using a hydrometer (Gee &\nBauder 1986). Calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE)\nwas determined by the acid dissolution (Loeppert\n& Suarez 1996). The method of Nelson and Som\u00ad\nmers (1982) was used for organic matter measure\u00ad\nment. Cation exchange capacity was investigated by\n1 mol/l NaOAc, pH 8.2 (Chapman 1965) and HNO 3\nextractable K (as total K) was determined with boiling\nnitric acid 1 mol/l (Pratt 1965) and extractable K\nwas determined with NH 4 OAc (Mc Lean & Watson\n1985). Non-exchangeable K content was calculated\nwith the following formula:\n\n\nNon _-_ exchangeable K = HNO 3 extractable K \u2013\n\nNH OAc extractable K\n4\n\n\n**Clay mineralogy** . Clay mineralogy was performed\non the first and second horizon (total of 22 samples)\nof each pedon (Kittrick & Hope 1963; Jackson\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Location of the study area in Fars Province in southern Iran and location of eleven pedons studied in Ghare\u00ad\nbagh Plain\n\n\n**201**\n\n\n_Original Paper_ _Soil & Water Res., 13, 2018 (4): 200\u2013207_\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.17221/138/2017-SWR\n\n\n\n1975). A 1130 X-ray diffractometer (Philips, Netherlands) with Cu K\u03b1 target under 40 kV and 30 mA was\nused for the analysis. Semi-quantitative estimation\nof clay minerals was performed by comparing the\narea under each diffractogram in Mg-saturated slide\ntreated with ethylene glycol (Johns _et al_ . 1954).\n\n**K-release kinetics** . Soluble and exchangeable K\nwas first removed from soil samples using 1 mol/l\nCaCl 2 for 24 h followed by the centrifugation of\nsuspensions. Excess Cl was removed by water and\nalcohol (Martin & Sparks 1983). Subsequently,\n2 g soil samples in 3 replicates were transferred\ninto centrifuge tubes in two sets containing 20 ml of\n10 mmol/l of CaCl 2 and oxalic acid solutions. Samples\nwere equilibrated for 2, 4, 8, 14, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96,\n120, 168, 192, 360, 528, 696, 864, 1200, and 1368 h\nat 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. After each period, the supernatant was\nseparated and a new portion of extractant was added,\nshaken, and centrifuged. The K concentration was\nmeasured in the supernatant by a flame photometer\n(Model PFP7, Jenway, UK). The cumulative release\nof non-exchangeable K with time was fitted to the\nsimplified Elovich equation:\n\n\n_Y_ = _a_ + _b_ ln _t_\n\n\nparabolic diffusion equation:\n\n\n_Y_ = _a_ + _b_ _t_ [1/2]\n\n\nand power function equation:\n\n\nln _Y_ = ln _a_ + _b_ ln _t_\n\n\nwhere:\n\n_Y_ \u2013 quantity of K released (mg/kg) at time _t_\n_a_, _b_ \u2013 constants\n\n\nThe above equations were tested using the _R_ [2] analy\u00ad\nsis and standard error of the estimate by\n\n\nSE = [\u2211 ( _Y_ \u2013 _Y_ *) [2] /( _n_ \u2013 2)] [1/2]\n\n\nwhere:\n\n_Y_ - \u2013 calculated content of K released at time _t_\n\n_n_ \u2013 data number\n\n\n**Statistical analyses** . Statistical analyses were per\u00ad\nformed using SPSS software package (Ver. 23, 2016).\nThe means were compared using Duncan\u2019s test at\n_P_ < 0.05. Linear regression procedure was used to\ndescribe the kinetic equations of non-exchangeable\nK release. The correlation between K release char\u00ad\n\nacteristics and selected soil chemical and physical\nproperties was calculated using Pearson\u2019s test.\n\n\n**202**\n\n\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n\nSoils of Gharebagh Plain were classified as Enti\u00ad\nsols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Histosols, Aridisols, and\nAlfisols (Table 1).\n\nResults of the study showed that the pH of soils\nranged from 7.1 to 8.3, EC ranged from 0.8 to 32 mS/cm\nand the CaCO 3 content ranged from 32 to 8%. The\nminimum (0.1%) and the maximum (21%) contents\nof organic carbon were measured in Aridisols and\nHistosols, respectively. The CEC ranged from 72 in\nEntisols to 578 mmol(+)/kg in Histosols (Table 2).\n\nThe semi-quantitative clay mineralogy in the area\nis shown in Table 1. The trend of palygorskite < kao\u00ad\nlinite < vermiculite < chlorite < smectite < illite was\n\nobserved for clay mineral content. Palygorskite was\nfound only in saline soils, but other clay minerals\nwere detected in all studied soils. The relative quanti\u00ad\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The overall results\nshowed that the studied soils contained large amounts\nof non-exchangeable K except Histosols (pedon 5)\nand subsoil layer of Entisols (pedon 1). The maximum\ncontent of non-exchangeable K (506 mg/kg soil) was\nfound in the surface layer of Inceptisols having ver\u00ad\ntic properties (pedon 2) with a high amount of clay\n(41%) and relatively low calcium carbonate (37%),\nwhereas the minimum content (95 mg/kg soil) was\n\n\n\nmeasured in the subsoil of Entisols (pedon 1) with\nlow clay (10%) and high calcium carbonate contents\n(88%) (Table 3). The release of non-exchangeable K\nby both the extractants was higher in surface soil\ncompared to subsurface soil (Table 4). CaCl 2 and\noxalic acid released more K in surface soils compared\nto subsurface soils (22 and 28%, respectively) from\nnon-exchangeable positions (Table 4).\n\nTime-dependent cumulative K released from soils\nusing CaCl 2 and oxalic acid is plotted in Figure 2.\nThe trend of the cumulative K release pattern was\nnon-linear and almost similar by the two extractants.\nThe K release pattern was characterized by an initial\n\n\n\n(a) Oxalic acid CaCl 2\n\n\n\np2 p4 p5 p6 p8\n\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\n\np2 p4 p5 p6 p8\n\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\n\n\np2 p4 p8 p6 p5\n\n\np2 p4 p6 p8 p5\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n300\n\n\n200\n\n\n100\n\n\n300\n\n\n250\n\n\n200\n\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n300\n\n\n200\n\n\n100\n\n\n0\n\n\n250\n\n\n200\n\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n\n50\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nTime (h) Time (h)\n\n\nFigure 2.

Plant\nuptake and leaching have been known to deplete\nsoluble and exchangeable K. In such conditions,\nnon-exchangeable K, which is less available to plants,\ncould gradually be released to readily available (solu\u00ad\nble and exchangeable K) forms (Najafi-Ghiri _et_\n_al_ . 2010). The maximum K release was observed in\nthe surface horizon of Inceptisols (Table 3), due to\nthe presence of vertic properties (pedon 2) caused\nby illite and higher content of non-exchangeable K\n(Tables 1 and 3). On the other hand, the minimum\n\nK release was measured in the subsurface horizon\n\nof an Entisol with low clay and high calcium car\u00ad\n\n\n\nbonate contents. Supporting this conclusion, the\npositive correlation was found between clay content\n( _r_ = 0.67** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = 0.64** for oxalic acid)\nand K release. In contrast, the non-exchangeable\nK release was negatively correlated with CaCO 3 con\u00ad\ntent ( _r_ =\u20130.81** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = \u20130.78** for oxalic\nacid), probably due to its dilution effect. The effects\nof clay type, clay content and non-exchangeable K\ncontent on K release were also reported by other\nresearchers (Ajiboye & Ogunwale 2008; NajafiGhiri _et al_ . 2012).\n\nThe contents of non-exchangeable K and cumula\u00ad\ntive release of non-exchangeable K in surface soils\nwere significantly higher than in subsurface soils,\nwhich could be due to the higher content of illite\nand lower CaCO content in surface soil. The illite\n3\ncontent of surface soil was higher than in subsurface\nsoil (Table 4). The higher illite content on the surface\ncould be attributed to addition of K fertilizers and\n\ntransformation of smectite to illite together with\nhigh weathering of primary mica minerals to illite\n(Srinivasarao _et al_ . 2006; Simonsson _et al_ . 2009).\n\n\n\nTable 5.

The two\nphases of K release from soils were also reported by\nSrinivasarao _et al_ . (2006). Hosseinpur _et al_ . (2012)\nstated that the initial fast release of K may be due to\nthe release of K from peripheral edge sites whereas\nthe subsequent slower reaction represented the K re\u00ad\nlease from interlayer sites. Potassium ions could be\nreplaced from edge and planar sites of clay minerals\nby Ca [2+] but, due to high ionic radius and hydration\nenergy, Ca [2+] is not capable of replacing interlayer K.\nThe interlayer K could gradually be released with\ntime. Exudation of organic acids from roots into soil\nmay increase K availability. Oxalic acid is a com\u00ad\nmon organic acid identified in the rhizosphere of\ncalcicole plants (Rengel & Damon 2008). The acid\ncan destroy the soil K minerals such as muscovite,\nbiotite, and k-feldspars resulting in the release of K\nfrom non-exchangeable forms. However, the release\nof K by oxalic acid was lower than that by CaCl 2 . The\nlower released K content by oxalic acid might be due\nto high pH and CaCO 3 content of the studied soils\n(Table 3). The soils used in the present study were\ncalcareous, containing more than 30% of CaCO 3 and\npH > 7.2. Oxalic acid has two H [+] which are dissoci\u00ad\nated at pH > 4.5. Thus, the two free negative charges\ncould complexate with cations such as K, Ca, and Na.\nUnlike malate and citrate, oxalate has a great ability to\nchelate with Ca and oxalic acid is largely precipitated\nas Ca-oxalate and thereby a low content of K may be\nreleased (Tu _et al_ . 2007; Wani 2012).\n\nThe _b_ constant of the power function equation\nwas measured less than 1 in studied soils showing\na decrease in the K release with time (Table 5). It is\n\nwell documented that the _b_ constant from the Elovich\n\nequation can be used as an index of K release rate\n(Hosseinpur & Motaghian 2013). The positive cor\u00ad\nrelation was found between cumulative K released by\nCaCl 2 ( _r_ = 0.97**) and oxalic acid ( _r_ = 0.98**) with clay\ncontent. Also, _b_ from Elovich was positively correlated\nwith cumulative K release by CaCl 2 ( _r_ = 0.61**) and\noxalic acid ( _r_ = 0.65**). In contrast, the _b_ parameter\nconstant from Elovich was negatively correlated with\nCaCO 3 content ( _r_ = \u20130.77** for CaCl 2 and _r_ = \u20130.72**\nfor oxalic acid). Hosseinpur _et al_ . (2012) stated that\ndifferent _b_ constants could clearly reflect different\nK release power of their studied soils.\n\n\n**206**\n\n\n\nComparison of the _b_ constant between oxalic acid\nand CaCl showed a similar effect of the extractants\n2\non releasing K from non-exchangeable positions\n(Table 5). The clay mineral composition of studied\nsoils was almost similar, but illite seems to control\n\nthe K release rate of the soils. Our results indicated\n\nthat the _b_ constant was high in surface layers of In\u00ad\nceptisols and Alfisols with high clay and illite contents\n(pedons 2 and 8), whereas the lowest _b_ constant was\nfound in the subsurface horizons of Entisols (pedon 1)\nand Histosols (pedon 5). The high _b_ constant in\npedons 2 and 8 might be attributed to the expand\u00ad\nable nature of illite which permits K to be released\nfrom the edges and wedge areas (Srinivasarao _et_\n_al_ . 2006). The high content of non-exchangeable K\nin pedons 2 and 8 may also be responsible for the\nhigh _b_ constant in these soils (Table 3).\n\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\n\nThis study highlighted the relationship between\nnon-exchangeable K release and soil classification,\nclay mineralogy and soil depth in semi-arid regions\nof Fars Province **.** The results showed that soil order,\nsoil depth, and clay type play a significant role in\nnon-exchangeable K content and K release rate. The\nlowest contents of non-exchangeable K and K release\nrate were found in subsurface layers of Entisols with\nhigh CaCO 3 and low clay contents (pedon 1); while,\nthe highest values were found in Inceptisols with low\nCaCO 3 and high clay contents, dominated by illite.\nResults also indicated that the studied soils con\u00ad\n\ntained large amounts of non-exchangeable K which\ncould be released to accessible forms. However, the\namount of this reservoir has been depleted due to\ndevelopment of irrigated production systems, thus\nfurther application of K fertilizer seems necessary\nin the early future.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAjiboye G.A., Ogunwale J.A.

A negative input output balance of nutrients in the soil results when the crop\nnutrient removal and nutrient losses to other sinks become higher than the nutrient\n\n\u2013\ninputs into the system. Potassium (K) input output balance varies among regions\nthat have different climates, soil types, cropping systems, and cropping intensity.\nThis chapter illustrates the farm-gate K balances in major production areas of the\nworld and their impacts on native K fertility and crop yields. On-farm and on-station\nresearch examples show significant negative K balances in South Asia and\nSub-Saharan Africa, while China, the USA, Brazil, and countries of the Latin\nAmerica Southern Cone highlighted continued requirement of location-specific K\napplication to maintain crop yields and soil K fertility status at optimum levels.\n\n\n11.1 Concepts of Soil Nutrient Balance\n\n\nSoil nutrient balance is an account of the total inputs and outputs of a particular\nnutrient in an agroecosystem (NAL 2020). Soil nutrient balance is the principle of\nmass balance applied to crop nutrients. Mass balance accounts for the matter\nentering, present in, and leaving a system. \u00d6born et al. (2003) separated soil nutrient\nbalances into three categories: farm-gate, field, and farm-system budgets. These\ntypes of balances compare nutrient imports to nutrient exports. Farm-gate balances\nare not limited to farms but can be calculated at a variety of scales, depending on the\ndata available. In this chapter, we focus on K farm-gate balances at the state/province\nand national levels across major production areas of the world.\n\n\n11.1.1 Potassium Removal and Use for Different Cropping\nSystems and Geopolitical Boundaries\n\n\nBecause of its economic and environmental importance, there is increasing interest\nin developing ways to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of fertilizer use on\nfarms, as well as at regional and national scales. Partial nutrient balance (PNB) is,\nfor a given nutrient, the sum of outputs divided by the sum of inputs (Table 11.1).\nPartial factor productivity (PFP) is, for a given nutrient, biomass yield divided by\nthe sum of inputs. Both can provide some guidance on system-level efficiency\nrelative to nutrient use. These two metrics have been used to describe system\nperformance in relation to nutrient use at continental (Ladha et al. 2003), national\n(Lassaletta et al. 2014), regional (Edis et al. 2012), and at farm-gate (Gourley et al.\n2012) scales, and by industry (McLaughlin et al. 1992). Although trends in N and P\nuse have been presented (Zhang et al. 2015; Lassaletta et al. 2014), there are few\nreports of these trends for K other than Fixen et al. (2015).

(2015)\n\n\nprovide a selection of case studies from different regions and at different scales on\nthe removal and use of K within farming systems.\n\n\n11.1.2 Metrics for Nutrient Use Efficiency\n\n\nNutrient use efficiency (NUE) is an evaluation of crop performance based on the\nquantity of a given nutrient input. Nutrient use efficiency is a broad term and is\nquantified in various ways by various metrics. Table 11.1 shows a selection of\nnutrient use efficiency terms and their definitions. Partial nutrient balance and PFP\nhave already been discussed. Partial nutrient balance intensity (PNBI) is, for a\ngiven nutrient, the sum of inputs minus the sum of outputs on an area basis. Where\ndata or estimates exist, outputs and inputs can include all of those in the K cycle\n[(Fig. 1.2, Chap. 1). Agronomic efficiency (AE) is, for a given nutrient, the increase](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59197-7_1)\nin biomass yield divided by the associated sum of inputs. Positive returns to fertilizer\ninvestments are indicated when AE is greater than the ratio of fertilizer price to crop\nprice. Recovery efficiency (RE) is, for a given nutrient, the increase in uptake\ndivided by the associated sum of inputs. Recovery efficiency ranges from 0 to 1, with\n1 interpreted as complete uptake of all of the nutrients applied. Of these metrics,\nPNB and PNBI are most often used to evaluate soil nutrient balances.\nAt the field, farm, or region scale, PNB K and PNBI K are often calculated using\nonly harvested plant K and fertilizer K (inorganic and organic). Calculating PNB K\n\n\n286 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nand PNBI K with just these data is widely performed, but only indicates the fate of\nharvest nutrients and does not consider other transfer or retention fates. Partial\n\nnutrient balance has been recommended by the International Fertilizer Association\n(IFA 2020), the EU Nitrogen Expert Panel (2015), and the Global Partnership on\nNutrient Management (Norton et al. 2015) as the most appropriate measure of\nnutrient use efficiency because data are generally available at farm and national\nlevels from which it can be calculated.\n\nIn the context of K, when the sum of K outputs equals the sum of K inputs,\nPNB K \u00bc 1 and PNBI K \u00bc 0. When more K is added than removed, PNB K < 1 and\nPNBI K - 0 (positive). The nutrient not removed can either be stored in the soil\nand/or flow through to the environment. When more K is removed than supplied,\nPNB K - 1 and PNBI K < 0 (negative), indicating that the soil is being depleted of K,\nlowering soil fertility. The extent to which this depletion can continue without\naffecting yield depends on the level of soil reserves as well as the rate at which K\nbecomes plant available.\nPartial nutrient balance does not describe pathways of internal K transformation\nwithin a system (e.g., K dissolution or fixation in soils). It is not necessarily a direct\nquantitative estimate of K loss from the system, because K not removed in the\nharvest might remain on site in the soil. Over the long term, however, changes in soil\nK stocks are usually small relative to inputs and outputs, and therefore, low PNB K\nvalues over multiple years are reasonably reliable indirect indicators of K depletion.\nThe selection of NUE indicators should be considered in the light of the purpose\nof the undertaking. An indicator may be used by growers at field scale or as a\n\n\u2014\nstatement of accountability at a regional and/or industry scale. The two reasons\n\n\u2014\nwhile not mutually exclusive do require clarity of purpose and transparency of data\nused to derive them. None of the indicators reference soil health or soil nutrient\n\nconcentrations, so they are incomplete in their description of sustainability impacts.\nBecause marginal nutrient use declines as the nutrient is supplied, the highest values\nof many indicators occur at the lowest level of application which is also likely the\nlowest yield. More discussion on selecting appropriate nutrient performance indicators can be found in Fixen et al. (2015) and Norton et al. (2015).\n\n\n11.1.3 Uncertainties in Estimating Nutrient Balances\n\n\nNutrient balances provide perspective on the extent of nutrient sources relative to\ncrop demand and may be helpful in identifying opportunities to improve nutrient use\nefficiency. However, unlike a financial balance sheet, nutrient balances involve\nconsiderable uncertainty, particularly at regional and national scales. These uncertainties derive from regional variations in crop K concentration, inadequate information on nutrient removal by some crops, lack of information on the contribution of\nmanure, inability to account for nutrient loss by runoff and erosion, poor fertilizer\nuse data, and other factors. Because of these sources of error, at best, nutrient balance\nis only a partial balance (Roberts and Majumdar 2017).\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 287\n\n\nDeriving these ratios relies on reliable data on crop production (e.g., FAOSTAT),\nfertilizer use (e.g., IFA industry statistics), and crop product nutrient density (e.g.,\nFAOSTAT). While of interest at a general level, the data do not provide information\nthat can be used for system improvement and is just a reporting method. The metrics\nare more an assessment of the inherent K fertility of the system, the type of crop\nproduced, and the farming system employed.\nWhile production quantities are reasonably well known, the amount of grain\nretained on-farm for seed, animal feed, or domestic use is not often included. Also,\nthe area of crop production could be the areas of the country, of agriculture, of arable\nfarming, the area sown, fertilized, or harvested. The nutrient concentration of\nmanures and organic supplements included in the budget approach is quite variable.\nFor example, the sugar industry in Australia has an apparent high PNB K because\ncalculations do not often include K-rich by-products from sugar mills that are\nrecycled back onto cane fields.\nA second aspect of the uncertainties is the concentration of the nutrient in the\nproduct removed as well as in nutrient inputs. For example, Norton (2012) reported\nthat K concentrations in wheat grain varied by \ufffd14% of the mean value for dry grain\nof 4606 mg K kg [\u2013][1] . As a consequence, any PNB K or PFP K is likely to have a\n10\u201315% error embedded in the data used to derive the metric.\n\nThirdly, there are few reliable data sets on the use of fertilizers on different crops,\nand the best current data at the national level was reported by Heffer (2013),\nalthough regional agricultural and resource management groups may also hold\nsimilar data from farm surveys, various agricultural agencies, or the fertilizer\nindustry. Even so, not many sources disaggregate the data to fertilizer use by\nproduction region and crop, which is really the detail required for growers and\nadvisors to make system-level improvements.\nFinally, a single fertilizer application may carry through to a second and often\n\n\u2013\ndifferent crop, such as in a maize soybean rotation. The residual nutrient carryover\nand then removal by the second crop is not accounted for, similar to not taking\naccount of K released from soil minerals in the balance calculations.\n\nThe critical aspects of developing these metrics are to ensure that the data are\ntransparent, auditable, referenced, consider all nutrient sources, and are regionally\nrelevant and appropriate to the intention as to how the metrics are to be interpreted.\n\n\n11.1.4 Interpreting Nutrient Balance Information\n\n\nThe first and most significant issue to consider when interpreting a nutrient metric is\nthe degree of limitation that the particular nutrient imposes on the system studied. If\nthe nutrient is not limiting crop growth due to high soil reserves or other biotic or\nabiotic influences, then the value of PNB K and PFP K will be high, as little K fertilizer\nis applied relative to yield and nutrient removal. This can give an unrealistic\nimpression of the potential returns on K investment from the PFP K value and an\nover-assessment of the degree of soil depletion occurring from PNB K . In such cases,\n\n\n288 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nPNBI K may be a more accurate indicator of soil depletion since it is an extensive or\narea-based rather than intensive metric.\n\nWhere K is the most limiting nutrient, over the long term and within the bounds of\nerrors associated with the data, it is desirable for PNB K to approach unity, so that\ninput and output are balanced. When PNB K < 0.5, there is probably an opportunity\nfor using evidence-based nutrient management principles to improve efficiency. At\nthe other extreme, when PNB K - 1.0, it is likely that efficiency cannot be improved\nfurther without risking the depletion of soil supply. However, this should not imply\nthat PNB K values between 0.5 and 1.0 are necessarily acceptable, because, as\nalready noted, a PNB K value of, say 0.7, maybe good for some systems in some\nplaces and not so good for other systems in other places.\nWhile mean values are useful, downscaled nutrient performance indicators from\ndairy farms (Gourley et al. 2012) and grain farms (Norton 2017) are highly variable\nand generally skewed. While the distribution of these values can be informative for\ngrowers as benchmarks for nutrient performance in a participatory research setting,\nvalid comparisons can only be made among similar systems.\nTrends in efficiency metrics can be viewed in a broader background against\neconomic development in general. An economic Kuznets curve (Kuznets 1955)\nidentifies that as an economy develops, resource-use metrics like PNB initially\nindicate unsustainability (such as PNB >> 1) as resources are exploited, but then\nresource use becomes more sustainable as inputs become economic. So nutrient\nPNBs are likely to reflect the stage of economic development and agricultural\nindustrialization as well as production systems management.\n\n\n11.2 Australia\n\n\nIn Australia, grazing land accounts for 87% of agricultural land use, with 16% of\nland under improved pastures. Around 50 M ha is used for crop production, with less\nthan 5% irrigated. Farmers produce around 40 Mt of grains annually, with wheat\n(Triticum aestivum L.) (24 Mt) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (7 Mt) as the main\ngrains. Sugarcane (Saccharum giganteum (Walter) Pers.), cotton (Gossypium\nhirsutum L.), and viticulture are worth a total of around $4.2 billion annually,\nwhile other horticultural crops add another $8 billion. The Australian beef, sheep,\nand dairy industries are largely pasture-based, and the gross value of slaughtering is\nover $7.3 billion, while dairy products ($4.7 billion) and wool ($2.6 billion) are also\nsignificant industries. Grain and red meat production are highly variable due to\nseasonal conditions, and growers are careful with the allocation of production\nresources (ABARES 2016).\nAll the K fertilizer used in Australia is imported, and the annual peak quantity of\nimported KCl was ~480 kt 2004/2007, equivalent to ~239 kt K, assuming KCl\naveraged 60% K 2 O. The annual peak of K 2 SO 4 imports was 60 kt in 2012, or\n25 kt K, calculated using a 50% K 2 O concentration for K 2 SO 4 . Long-term K use has\nbeen ~170 kt of K, but during the \u201cMillennium Drought\u201d total K fertilizer use\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 289\n\n\n\nFig. 11.1 Partial nutrient\nbalance intensity (PNBI K,\nkg K ha [\u2013][1] ) across different\nnatural resource\n\nmanagement regions across\nAustralia for (a) 2007\u20132008\nand (b) 2011\u20132012. Values\nreported are the means for\neach 2-year period. In\ngeneral, the red regions\nindicate where nutrient\n\nremoval is more than\n\nnutrient supply. (OzDSM\n2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeclined to a low of 134 kt K in 2009, but has since recovered to 227 kt K according\nto the 2016\u20132017 report from Fertilizer Australia (Drew 2018). This amount makes\nup less than 1% of the global K used.\nUsing the agricultural production and fertilizer use data, PNB K can be calculated\nat national and regional scales, with regional fertilizer use data derived from farm\nsurveys (ABS 2016). In aggregate, the national PNB K was 2.9 for the audited period,\nand PNBI K was \u20130.6 kg K ha [\u2013][1], with the denominator used as the area of land used\nfor agricultural production. These values are consistent with the National Land and\nWater Resources Audit (2001) which reported that K use was around one-third of the\namount of K removed.\n\nThe patterns across different Australian resource management regions for two\naudit periods are shown in Fig. 11.1. The distribution of the balances largely reflects\nthe balance of enterprises within each region, as well as the inherent K fertility of the\n\n\n290 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nTable 11.2 Partial K balance (PNB K ) and the nutrient balance intensity (PNBI K ) averaged for\n2008 and 2010: mean rates are derived from the reported fertilizer use and the areas fertilized; the\nproportion of the total K fertilizer used by each industry was derived from the survey data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Industry|Partial nutrient<br>balance (PNB )<br>K|Partial nutrient<br>balance intensity<br>(PNBI )<br>K|Mean<br>application<br>rate of K|Industry<br>proportion of<br>K use|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Industry|Unitless|kg K ha\u20131|kg K ha\u20131|%|\n|Grain and<br>livestock|3.1|3.7|2|14|\n|Other grains|5.5|4.1|1|19|\n|Rice|6.9|14.8|2|0|\n|Cotton|0.5|\u201310.6|23|7|\n|Sugarcane|7.6|84.9|13|5|\n|Vegetables<br>(outdoors)|1.2|4.8|21|6|\n|Tree fruits and<br>vines|1.3|3.7|14|10|\n|Sheep farming,<br>specialized|2.9|3.1|2|4|\n|Beef cattle farm-<br>ing, specialized|1.5|3.1|6|16|\n|Sheep-beef cat-<br>tle farming|2.9|1.7|2|4|\n|Dairy cattle<br>farming|1.6|5.5|10|17|\n\n\nABS (2016)\n\n\nsoils. In essence, the areas where K was in the largest deficit were in the sugargrowing areas in Queensland and the lower rainfall grain-growing regions of\nWestern Australia, South Australia, and Central Queensland. It should be noted\nthat the data used to generate these maps did not include any recycled materials such\nas mill wastes from sugar processing or manures used as inputs into crop production.\nEdis et al. (2012) used farm survey data that included fertilizer inputs estimated\nfor each industry to disaggregate PNB K and PNBI K by commodity. These data are\nsummarized in Table 11.2, which shows that all industries except cotton have more\nK removed than applied as fertilizer. Cotton is usually grown in rotation with other\nannual crops so the true K balance is confounded by fertilizer practices on those\nother crops. There is much less K applied than is removed and the largest apparent\ndeficits are in the grains, sugar, and dairy industries. Recycled K-rich mill wastes are\nnot included for the sugar industry, and PNB K and PNBI K for the dairy industry do\nnot include K supplied to pastures that is ultimately derived from feeds purchased\nfrom outside the farm-gate. Gourley et al. (2012) reported that K from cattle feed\naveraged 25 kg K ha [\u2013][1] compared to a fertilizer input of 32 kg K ha [\u2013][1] from data\ncollected on 44 dairy farms across Australia, so that total K input in this industry may\nbe underestimated.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 291\n\n\nWhile it may be of interest to compare industries or regions, there are important\nlimitations in the data presented in both Fig. 11.1 and Table 11.2. The survey sample\nsizes are small which leads to up-scaling errors, and in these data, the up-scaled\nnational K use is about 65% of the fertilizer industry-reported consumption. Underreporting of K use in these farm surveys is likely a consequence of imprecise survey\nquestions that, for example, do not discriminate fertilizer product application rate\nfrom nutrient rate. Regional differences in product nutrient density, rotations used,\nand the extent of the use of recycled matter all make the actual values imprecise and\nof limited value in drawing conclusions about the efficiency of different production\n\nsystems.\nHowever, the major significant deficiency in these types of regional or industrybased data is that averages provide little or no intelligence to growers on their farmlevel balances. The data collected by Gourley et al. (2012) for the dairy industry and\nNorton and vanderMark (2016) for the grains industry gives error terms around the\ninputs, as well as the derived metrics concerning nutrient use efficiency.\n\n\n11.2.1 Southern Australian Grain Farms\n\n\nWhile regional performance indicators are of interest in a policy sense, the collection\nand collation of nutrient removal and use at farm or field levels are more important to\ngrowers, as these data inform them about how their specific management practices\nhave built up or depleted nutrients over time. Such an understanding will help them\nmake decisions about appropriate interventions to address any imbalances.\nNorton (2017) reported nutrient performance indicators from a survey of\n474 fields (34,900 ha) between 2010 and 2014 in south-eastern Australia. Nutrient\nbalances (nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P], K, and sulfur [S]) for each field over the\naudit period were estimated from fertilizer use, stubble management (burned,\nremoved, grazed), and crop yield. Grain and hay yields were recorded in the farm\nrecords, and regional wheat grain nutrient concentrations for wheat (Norton 2012)\nand canola (Brassica napus L.) (Norton 2014a) were used to estimate removal in\ngrains. Other values were derived from the values used in the NLWA (2001). The\nsummary presented here is for the K balances alone.\nEven though 20% of surveyed fields received K fertilizer, with an average K\napplication rate of <10 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1], where K fertilizer was used, the application\nrates were about 90 kg K ha [\u2013][1] on canola and 66 kg K ha [\u2013][1] on cereals. On the fields\nwhere K was applied, PNB K and PFP K were calculated with the median PNB K of\n3.0, and only seven of the fields surveyed showed more K use than removal over the\naudit period. Even where K was used, 12 fields had PNB K - 5 (Fig. 11.2a). The\nPFP K values where K was used had a median of 350 kg grain kg [\u2013][1] K (Fig. 11.2b).\nThe low use of K in eastern Australia in particular can be explained by the\ngenerally high soil test K values, indicating that supplementary K was not required.\nChristy et al. (2015) re-analyzed soil test data collected in the NLWA (2001) to\nassess the proportion of areas where a response to K was likely based on the soil test\n\n\n292 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n1     6     12     18     24     30     36     42     48     54     60     66     72     78     84     90    96\n\n\n\n500\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n1     6     12     18     24     30     36     42     48     54     60     66     72     78     84     90    96\n\n\nField number\n\n\nFig. 11.2 Nutrient performance metrics for K as derived from a survey of Australian farmers\u2019\nfields: (a) partial nutrient balance (PNB K ), and (b) partial factor productivity (PFP K ). (adapted from\nNorton 2017)\n\n\ncritical values (Brennan and Bell 2013). In the south-eastern grain-producing areas,\nsoil K concentrations are generally higher in the lower rainfall areas, but there are\nregions in the higher rainfall zones near the coast where yield responses to added K\nare likely. About half the K soil test values on sand and loam soil types in\nsouthwestern Victoria are low and these are coincident with the areas where K\n\nfertilizer was reported to be applied from the farm survey (Christy et al. 2015). In\nparticular, low soil K concentrations were seen on lighter acid soils under high\nrainfall conditions and also in formed-in-place Vertosols in both Victoria and\nQueensland.\n\n\n11.2.2 Trends in Potassium Removal\n\n\nSimilar to the high PNB K values reported in the NLWA (2001), Bell and Moody\n(2005) reported consistently negative K budgets for grain farms in the northern\ncropping region of Australia. The extent of the deficit was linked to regional crop\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 293\n\n\nproductivity and the low use of K fertilizer. Potassium removal was highest in\nchickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crops because of the higher than average grain K\nconcentrations in chickpeas being consistently higher yielding than crops like\nsorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Typically, K removals were between\n8 and 20 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] over a five-crop sequence. They also reported low and\ndeclining soil K concentrations in many of the summer cropping regions in Queensland. Soil test K values showed stratification with around 1.6\u20133.2 times more\nexchangeable K in the topsoil than the subsoil. This depletion has largely gone\n\n\u2013\nundetected by soil tests which generally represent only the 0 10 cm topsoil. There\nare now research projects investigating deep placement of K (and P) as a means of\nalleviating this deficiency.\nThere is concern about this depletion trend more widely in regions where K\nfertilizer has not been traditionally used. Key factors indicating a future K response\nare cropping on soils that have low to moderate exchangeable and non-exchangeable\nK reserves, and where K removal in harvested grain and hay is high. Indeed, the\nconsistently low grain K concentrations in some areas coupled with some very low K\nusage suggested that the soil K status may be approaching low levels\u2014whether due\nto stratification, presence of high sodium (Na), or the lack of substantial\nnon-exchangeable K reserves.\nPotassium fertilizer use in Australia is relatively modest on a world scale, and\nthere is approximately 3 times more K removed in agricultural products than is\nsupplied. While K removal is highest on sugarcane farms, there is a modest deficit\nfor most farms due to low productivity. Regional differences in K use and PNB K\nreflect the intensity of production and the inherent K fertility of the regions, although\nthere are inconsistencies in the data available to estimate K balances and nutrient\n\nperformance indicators. Western Australia uses most K fertilizer for grain production. Victoria uses K mainly on intensive pastures (especially dairy), while in\nQueensland K is mainly focused on the sugar industry. The data presented here\nindicate that grain-producing fields in the higher rainfall regions of southern\nAustralia are in significant K deficit, despite the low inherent K fertility. Private,\nstate, and federal agencies are addressing and communicating evidence-based nutrient management strategies to growers to overcome these deficits and improve\nproductivity (Norton 2014b, Norton and vanderMark 2016).\n\n\n11.3 Southeast Asia\n\n\nThe K balance assessment for Southeast Asia includes four crops most important\nboth economically and for K use: rice (Oryza sativa L., maize (Zea mays L.),\nsugarcane, and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) in five countries in the region:\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The choice of crops,\ncountries, and crop year included in the K balance estimation were based on the\navailability of data on fertilizer K application by crop and country. The latest\n\n\n294 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\navailable dataset with the highest number of countries and crops in the region was\nreported by Heffer (2013) for the crop year 2010\u20132011.\n\n\n11.3.1 Data Sources and Limitations\n\n\nIn 2010\u20132011, the five countries produced a total of 148.5 Mt of rice grain, 23.0 Mt\nof maize grain, 132.3 Mt of cane sugar, and 218.8 Mt of palm oil (as fresh fruit\nbunch) (Table 11.3). The total area harvested for these four crops was 57.3 Mha,\naccounting for 61% of the total crop area (94.9 Mha of arable land and permanent\ncropland) in the five countries (Table 11.4).

We assumed that the K content of oil palm fresh fruit bunch in the Philippines\nand Thailand was similar to that of Indonesia. Since oil palm production data were\nreported by USDA FAS (2017) as palm oil, the equivalent production of fresh fruit\nbunches was calculated by assuming an oil yield of 20% of fresh fruit bunch biomass\n(Corley and Tinker 2016).\n\n\n11.3.2 Trends in Potassium Balance\n\n\nRice is the most important cereal crop in Southeast Asia, covering 38% of the total\ncrop area (Table 11.4). In rice, crop removal exceeded K application with a deficit\nof \u201333 to \u201383 kt K 2 O in Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand; whereas K application\nexceeded crop removal with a K surplus of 46 kt and 96 kt K 2 O in Malaysia and\n\n\n296 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nVietnam, respectively (see PNBI K values in Table 11.5). Across the five countries,\nthere was a K deficit of \u201328 kt K 2 O in rice-growing areas. Since the calculated\nPNBI K values only accounted for grain removal, greater K deficits are expected in\nareas where rice straw is also removed from the field (for off-farm use). Previous\nstudies reported negative K balances in rice in irrigated long-term experiments in\nIndonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam (Dobermann et al. 1996) and in rainfed lowland\nrice in Indonesia (Wihardjaka et al. 1999).\nMaize is the second most important cereal crop in Southeast Asia, with an area\nharvested of 7.64 million ha in the five countries (Table 11.4). Out of the five\ncountries, only the Philippines showed a K deficit (\u201315 kt K 2 O), while the K balance\nin the other four countries ranged from 0.7 kt K 2 O (Malaysia) to 80 kt K 2 O\n(Indonesia) (Table 11.5). Similar to rice, PNBI K calculations for maize only\naccounted for grain removal; hence PNBI K will be further reduced if K removed\nwith maize stover is included. Pasuquin et al. (2014) reported cases of negative K\nbalance in maize in Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam when most of the aboveground residues were removed from the field. In Southeast Asia, farmers manage\ntheir maize residues in varied ways. In the Philippines, for example, while many\nfarmers retain the residues in their field, some still practice full removal or burning of\nresidues to facilitate land cultivation, especially with the use of non-mechanized\ntillage implements.\nOil palm occupies the second largest area harvested, with Indonesia and Malaysia\nbeing the two largest producers of oil palm in the region (Table 11.4). While oil palm\nis only grown in four of the five countries, it is the biggest user of applied K fertilizer\n(69%) among the four crops (Table 11.5). Potassium applications exceeded crop\nremoval (positive PNBI K values) in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; while crop\nremoval exceeded applications (negative PNBI K value) in the Philippines\n(Table 11.6).\nSugarcane covers the least area among the four crops (Table 11.4), but it is one of\nthe important economic crops in the region and a heavy user of fertilizer\nK. Table 11.5 shows that annual application of K exceeded crop removal by\n0.8\u201343 kt K 2 O in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. On the other hand, K deficit\nis indicated in the Philippines (\u201316 kt K 2 O) and Thailand sugarcane production (\u2013\n30 kt K 2 O). A previous study reported negative K balances in Thailand for yields of\n30 t ha [\u2013][1] (of dry cane) and above at a K fertilizer application rate of 94 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1]\n\n(Trelo-ges et al. 2004).\nIn the five countries in Southeast Asia included in this K budget, the amount of K\nfertilizer needed to replace crop removal follows the order: oil palm > rice >\nsugarcane > maize (Table 11.6). To be able to replace crop removal of the four\ncrops in five countries, a total amount of 3.46\u20135.76 Mt K 2 O will be needed at\nfertilizer use efficiencies of 50% and 30%, respectively. With the current crop area\ndedicated to these crops in this region, the crops with the largest requirement for K\nfertilizer are: oil palm in Indonesia and Malaysia, rice in the Philippines and\n\n\u2013\nVietnam, and sugarcane and rice in Thailand. Based on 2010 2011 fertilizer application and the estimated fertilizer requirement to replace crop removal, opportunities\nfor improving K application are evident in most of the countries and crops.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 297\n\n\nTable 11.6 Estimated fertilizer K requirement to replace crop removal and fertilizer K deficit of the\ncurrent application practice at 30% (A) and 50% (B) fertilizer use efficiency scenarios in four crops\nin five Southeast Asian countries (expressed at K 2 O)\n\n|Country|Rice|Col3|Maize|Col5|Sugarcane|Col7|Oil palm|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Country|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|kt K2O|\n|Country|A|B|A|B|A|B|A|B|\n\n\n\nFertilizer K requirement to replace crop removal [a]\n\n|Indonesia|641|385|65|39|68|41|1834|1101|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Malaysia|29|17|1|0.5|1|0.5|1284|770|\n|Philippines|190|114|70|42|97|58|9|5|\n|Thailand|349|210|40|24|371|223|142|85|\n|Vietnam|480|288|44|26|48|29|\u2013|\u2013|\n|Total|1689|1014|220|132|584|351|3269|1961|\n\n\n\nFertilizer K deficit of the current application practice [b]\n\n|Indonesia|\u2013503|\u2013247|35|61|\u20135|22|\u20131059|\u2013326|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Malaysia|26|38|0.1|0.5|0|1|\u2013295|219|\n|Philippines|\u2013166|\u201390|\u201364|\u201336|\u201384|\u201345|\u20137|\u20133|\n|Thailand|\u2013327|\u2013188|\u201321|\u20135|\u2013290|\u2013142|\u201395|\u201338|\n|Vietnam|\u2013240|\u201348|\u201318|\u20130.4|\u201316|3|\u2013|\u2013|\n|Total|\u20131210|\u2013535|\u201368|20|\u2013394|\u2013161|\u20131456|\u2013148|\n\n\n\na \u2013\nUsing 2010 2011 crop removal data at fertilizer use efficiencies of 30% (A) and 50% (B) during\nthe year of application\nb Difference between 2010 and 2011 fertilizer K application and estimated fertilizer K requirement\nto replace crop removal at fertilizer use efficiencies of 30% (A) and 50% (B). A negative value\ndenotes a K application deficit\n\n\nFertilizer K deficits of current application practices (Table 11.6) are indicated in:\nrice for all countries except Malaysia; maize in the Philippines, Thailand, and\nVietnam; sugarcane for all countries except Malaysia; and oil palm for all four\ncountries. In the 30% fertilizer use efficiency scenario, there is a predicted annual\ntotal K deficit in the five countries of 1.2 Mt K 2 O in rice; 0.068 Mt K 2 O in maize;\n0.39 Mt K 2 O in sugarcane; and 1.46 Mt K 2 O in oil palm. Current production levels\nalso indicate opportunities for increasing production with intensification through\nimproved crop and nutrient management, which may require a further increase in K\nfertilizer application.\n\n\n11.4 China\n\n\nChina is the largest national consumer of fertilizer nutrients, accounting for nearly\n30% of global fertilizer use. From 1978 to 2015, total (N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O) fertilizer\nconsumption increased from 8.8 to 60.2 Mt, with an average annual increase rate of\n5.3%. The N, P 2 O 5, and K 2 O consumption in 2015 was 30, 19, and 11 Mt,\nrespectively.\n\n\n298 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n11.4.1 Potassium Use and Crop Production\n\n\nPotassium deficiency in crops was initially reported in Southern China in the 1970s\n(Lin 1989). Potassium did not receive as much attention as N and P in the next\ndecade but now has become a widespread limiting factor in agricultural production,\nespecially in some parts of northeast and north-central China (Liu et al. 2000).\nRecent research has demonstrated that K deficiencies in intensified agricultural\nproduction areas in China continue to be a challenge (He et al. 2009); however, K\nfertilizer input has increased dramatically over time, rising from 0.38 Mt K 2 O in\n1980 to 10.6 Mt K 2 O in 2015, with an average annual increment of 0.29 Mt\nK 2 O. The total grain production increased from 310 to 657 Mt during the same\nperiod, with an average annual increase rate of 2.1%. Fruit and vegetable production\nincreased annually by 6.4% and 9.8%, respectively, in the past 20 years. The\nunprecedented growth in China\u2019s fertilizer consumption and crop production in the\n\n\u2013\nlast decades prompted researchers to look at nutrient input output balances. Understanding the surplus/deficit and balance of cropland nutrients provides guidance to\nthe production, distribution, and application of fertilizer.\n\n\n11.4.2 Potassium Balance Studies\n\n\nPrevious research assessed farmland nutrient balances in China, including the K\nbalance at various scales (Wang et al. 2014; Chuan et al. 2014). These assessments\nemphasized that the nutrient balance estimations at the national scale would help\ndevelop national fertilizer policies, including decisions on investments for fertilizer\nfactories and the exploitation of local resources and minerals to supply nutrients.\nPotassium balances for the 30 provinces in China from 1961 to 1997 illustrated\nannual K depletion that increased from 2.9 Mt K (3.5 Mt K 2 O) in 1961 to 8.3 Mt K\n(10.0 Mt K 2 O) in 1997 (Sheldrick et al. 2003). Negative PNBI K (from \u201317 to \u2013\n245 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] ) were also reported from long-term fertilizer experiments in\nrice-based systems, irrespective of mineral K application and site (Zhang et al.,\n2010). Negative PNBI K persisted on wheat\u2013maize rotations even at K application\nrates as high as 112\u2013300 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] (Tan et al. 2012). A winter wheat study in the\nNorth China plain between 2005 and 2007 showed negative K balance in all the\ntreatments under different production practices, especially at high-yield levels (Niu\net al. 2013). About 79% of the assessed on-farm trials (n \u00bc 120) in potato (Solanum\ntuberosum L.) in north-western China had an average negative balance of \u2013102 kg K\nha [\ufffd][1] (Li et al. 2015). This overwhelming negative balance of K in soils of China\nstarted improving (becoming less negative) with the increase in fertilizer K application, along with the in-field retention of crop residues (Wang et al. 2014; Shen et al.\n2005). Several studies also show significant soil K surpluses in vegetable production\nfields in China (Huang et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008).\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 299\n\n\n11.4.3 Potassium Balances in Grain and Cash Crops\n\n\nThese studies provide critical information on K balances in China but mainly focus\non specific experimental sites or short-term observations. Nutrient balances can vary\nconsiderably from year to year, and short-term studies providing limited information\ncan be misleading.\nTwo follow-up studies in the past few years provide a more comprehensive\noverview on how soil test K levels and crop K responses changed over time and\nspace, and the status of K balances across China. He et al. (2015) used large on-farm\nexperimental datasets to assess spatial and temporal variation in soil test K and crop\nresponses to K between 1990 and 2012. The authors utilized datasets for plantavailable K from on-farm experiments, where soil samples from a depth of 0\u201320 cm\nwere collected and analyzed before sowing. The corresponding crop yield differences were measured between treatments fertilized with N+P+K or with only N+P.\nThe data were spatially desegregated and grouped based on geographical locations,\nsuch as northeast (NE), northcentral (NC), northwest (NW), southeast (SE), and\nsouthwest (SW) regions of China. In addition, each region was further divided into\ntwo sub-groups based on soil utilization pattern, grain crop, and cash crop systems.\nThe grain crop category included wheat, maize, rice, potato, and soybean (Glycine\nmax (L.) Merr.), while the cash crop group included vegetables, fruits, rapeseed\n(Brassica spp.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), cotton, and sugar crops. Results\nindicated that soil-extractable K concentrations (exchangeable K) increased with\ntime between 1990 and 2012. For grain crops, exchangeable K concentrations\nincreased only slightly; however, for cash crops, the K concentrations increased\ndramatically over the period. The trends of increased soil K in cash crops were\nconsistent with increased relative yield for cash crops and the high fertilizer K\napplication rates. The authors suggested that higher soil K concentrations under\ncash crops increased the average soil K estimations in China, leading to assumptions\nof surplus K in all soils. Even though extractable K in soils under grain crops\nincreased in the Northcentral, Southeast, and Southwest China in the 2000s as\ncompared with that in the 1990s, the average soil K values were less than the critical\nconcentration of 80 mg L [\u2013][1], except in the NW region. The results indicated that the\nexchangeable K continued to show a declining trend with large crop removal\nassociated with higher yields.\nThe PNB K was greater than 1.0 for both cash and grain crop categories,\nsuggesting that K removal by crop uptake exceeded K inputs from fertilizer\n(Fig. 11.3). The PNB K was higher for cash crops (mean: 2.1; range: 1.1\u20134.2) than\n\n\u2013\nfor grain crops (mean: 1.3; range: 1.0 1.5), indicating higher K depletion in cash\n\ncrops.\n\n\n300 K.

(2017b) using 31 provincial datasets from the China\nAgriculture Statistical Report for 1981 and 2011. The K consumption from fertilizers, human and livestock manure, straw return to field, cake manure, deposition,\nirrigation, seeds, crop removal, and K loss from soils were calculated with provincial\ndata and parameters from refereed literature. The arable crop output was the\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 301\n\n\nprincipal nutrient output pathway in the agricultural systems, which was calculated\nthrough economic yield and K requirement per unit of economic yield of various\ncrops. The arable crop outputs were categorized into five groups: cereal crops, fruit\nand vegetables (fruit, vegetable, and melons), oil crops (oil crops and beans),\nindustrial crops (sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), sugarcane, fiber crops, cotton and\ntobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)) and root crops (sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.)\nLam.) and potato). The PNBI K (kg K 2 O or kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) was estimated by calculating the total K added to farmland from various sources during the year (inputs)\nand subtracting the total amount of K removed from farmland by crop removal and K\nloss from leaching and runoff (outputs).\nThe farmland PNBI K was significantly different between 1980 and 2010 at the\nprovincial scale. The PNBI K in China changed from an average deficit of \u201313.6 kg\nK 2 O ha [\u2013][1] in 1980 to a surplus of 22.9 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] in 2010 (Fig. 11.4). In 1980,\nalmost 68% of the farmland area across 19 provinces showed K deficits (very low\nand low classes); however, 30% of farmland area in 10 provinces had PNBI K in the\nmoderate class (1\u201350 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) (Fig. 11.4a). In 2010, 40 and 44% of the\nfarmland was in the low and moderate PNBI K classes in 9 and 13 provinces,\nrespectively. Meanwhile, 11% of farmland was in the high PNBI K class in 5 provinces. Only 6% of farmland area showed a PNBI K in the very high class in four\nprovinces (Fig. 11.4).\nLiu et al. (2017a) followed up with a more comprehensive K balance across four\ndecades: 1980\u20131989, 1990\u20131999, 2000\u20132009, and 2010\u20132015. The data were\ndesegregated into six agricultural regions, based on geographical locations and\nChina\u2019s administrative divisions: northeast (NE); north-central (NC); northwest\n(NW); the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR); southeast\n(SE); and southwest (SW).\nMineral fertilizer, organic manure, and other K input resources (atmospheric\ndeposition, irrigation, and seeds) accounted for 33% (4.91 Mt K 2 O), 59% (8.85 Mt\nK 2 O), and 8% (1.19 Mt K 2 O) of the total K input from 1980 to 2015, respectively.\nThe K input through fertilizers increased from 0.38 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 10.58 Mt\nK 2 O in 2015. At the regional level, K inputs increased in all regions over time.\nIncreases in K inputs were greatest for the SE and least for both the NW and NE\n(Fig. 11.5a). By 2015, K input in the SE was the highest, followed by the SW,\nMLYR, NC, NW, and NE.\nThe average K output from 1980 to 2015 was 14.78 Mt K 2 O (146 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1]\n\nyear [\u2013][1] ). Crop removal accounted for 99% (14.63 Mt K 2 O) of the total output from\n1980 to 2015. Cereals removed 70, 65, 55, and 56% of the total K output in the\n1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, respectively. The K output of fruit and vegetables\nand oil crops increased over the years with average annual increments of 0.13 and\n0.05 Mt of K 2 O, respectively. Potassium outputs increased over time in all regions\n(Fig. 11.5). The K outputs in MLYR and SE were significantly larger than those in\nother regions. In the NE, K outputs increased from 1982 to 1989 then stabilized, with\nsome variation, from 1990 on.\nPotassium nutrient balance intensity increased from its lowest value in 1984\n(\u20133.23 Mt K 2 O) to a relatively stable value of around 2.1 Mt K 2 O in 2015.

The average PNBI K in the 2010s (2010\u20132015)\nvaried by region: SW (31.3 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > MLYR (15.9 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > NC\n(9.5 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > NW (8.2 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) > NE (\u201311.9 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ). The NE\n\n\u2013\nregion stayed in deficit for the entire period of assessment (1980 2015). The positive\nPNBI K in the NW region declined over time. In the NC region, PNBI K increased\nduring the first three decades but declined in the 2010s.\nReliable K fertilizer use and crop output data, along with information from\npublished peer-reviewed literature, allowed estimation of K balance in Chinese\nagriculture. Recent assessments of K inputs, outputs, and PNBI K in China showed\nsignificant spatial and temporal differences. Widespread negative K balances in soils\nbefore the 1980s have now changed toward a more positive balance due to increased\nuse of K fertilizers and retention of crop residues in the field. However, regional and\n\n\n304 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\ncrop-specific disparity in K use provides opportunities to further refine the K balance\nthrough site-specific nutrient management for sustainable crop production systems.\n\n\n11.5 India\n\n\nIndia is the second-largest consumer of fertilizer in the world. In nutrient terms, the\n2.5 Mt of K 2 O consumed in 2014 was 7.7% of the global consumption. Alluvial\n(Inceptisols and Entisols), Red and Lateritic (Alfisols and Ultisols), and Black\n(Vertisols) soils are dominant soil types in India. The Alluvial soils in the IndoGangetic Plains and elsewhere have ample available and reserve soil K. Despite\nhaving high available soil K, the Black soils, mainly in the Central and Western\nIndia, often show positive yield responses to added K. This response is most likely\ndue to low K availability because of relatively higher contents of Ca and Mg in these\nsoils. The Red and Lateritic soils in coastal and peninsular India typically have lower\nK content. Heffer (2013) estimated that over 60% of the total N + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O is\nused in cereal crops. Potassium used in cereals is about 50% of the total consumption. An estimate by Tewatia et al. (2017), using crop production statistics of\n2015\u20132016 and crop nutrient uptake information from multiple sources, showed\nthat removal of K 2 O by cereals is about half of the total K removed by all crops. The\nseeming parity between K applied and removed by cereals, however, is misplaced as\nthe removal of K by cereals is about 11 times more than the applied K.\n\n\n11.5.1 Crop Requirement and Potassium Use\n\n\nPost Green Revolution, India\u2019s agricultural production was largely driven by inorganic fertilizer use. The demand for crop commodities will rise in the future with\npopulation increase and changing food habits. Chand (2007) estimated that\n262, 19, 54, and 345 Mt of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane, respectively,\n\n\u2013\nwould be required in 2020, compared to the base year (2004 2005) production of\n\n\u2013\n193, 14, 35, and 262 Mt of the same crops. In 2014 2015, 235, 17, 28, and 363 Mt of\ncereals, pulses, oilseeds, and sugarcane were produced in India (FAI 2016). A\nslowdown of crop productivity (Kumar et al. 2004) and decline in PFP (NAAS\n2006), however, has been identified as major concerns. Biswas and Sharma (2008)\nshowed that response to applied fertilizer (kg grain [kg of added NPK] [\u2013][1] ) decreased\nfrom 13.4 to 3.7 between 1970 and 2005.\nImbalanced fertilization, more specifically low use of K, has been identified as\none of the major reasons for declining PFP in India. Several studies identified\ninequality between applied K and its removal in harvested crops, which impacts\ncrop productivity, nutrient use efficiencies, and soil K mining (Naidu et al, 2011;\nMajumdar et al. 2012, 2016; Singh et al. 2014). Long-term cropping with negative\nPNBI K has been associated with yield declines in the rice\u2013wheat system in South\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 305\n\n\n\nTable 11.7 Nutrient uptake\nfrom soil reserves under rice\u2013\n\nwheat cropping system\n\n\n\n\n\n|Location|K uptake from the soil reservea|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Location|Rice|Wheat|System|\n|Location|kg K2O ha\u20131|kg K2O ha\u20131|kg K2O ha\u20131|\n|Sabour|166|95|261|\n|Ranchi|127|78|205|\n|Ludhiana|211|143|354|\n|Palampur|141|85|226|\n|R.S.

(2006)\na rice (Oryza sativa L.); wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\n\n\nAsia (Regmi et al. 2002). Potassium partial nutrient balance intensities were negative\neven with recommended fertilizer application rates of K and were least negative\nwhen farmyard manure was a nutrient source or wheat residues were returned to the\nfield. Although the K-supplying capacity of illite-dominated alluvial soils of the\nIndo-Gangetic Plains is relatively high (Dobermann et al. 1996), long-term intensive\ncropping with inadequate application of K have been associated with large negative\nPNBI K and depletion of native K reserves (Gami et al. 2001; Yadvinder-Singh et al.\n2004). Multi-location studies in the rice\u2013wheat system indicated that soil reserves\ncontributed on an average 258 kg K 2 O in K omission plots (Tiwari et al. 2006)\n(Table 11.7). Several researchers have assessed K balances in systematic ways\ncontributing to our understanding at various scales.\n\n\n11.5.2 Potassium Balance at the Country Scale\n\n\nThe K partial nutrient balance intensity in most soils of India was largely negative as\ncrop removal far exceeded K additions through manures and fertilizers. Tandon\n(2004) reported an annual negative PNBI of \u20139.7 Mt of N+P+K in 1999\u20132000, of\nwhich 19% was N, 12% was P, and 69% was K. Satyanarayana and Tewatia (2009)\nestimated K balances in major agriculturally important states of India. Besides the\nmajor field crops, the authors considered the removal of nutrients by fruits and\nvegetables in all the states; tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze), coffee (Coffea spp.),\njute (Corchorus capsularis L.), rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A. Juss.)\nM\u00fcll.Arg.), and other plantation crops in states wherever applicable; and the total\nproduction values of commodities were multiplied by the nutrient uptake coefficient\nto arrive at nutrient removal figures. The authors used crop production, state fertilizer\n\n\n306 K.

Nutrient additions only through fertilizer was used\nwhere information on other nutrient sources was not available. The overall negative\nK balance was estimated at 9.7 Mt, and the western region (3.8 Mt) had the highest\nshare, followed by northern (2.6 Mt), eastern (1.9 Mt), and southern (1.3 Mt) regions\n(Table 11.8).\nDutta et al. (2013) estimated PNBI K in different states of India using the IPNI\nNuGIS approach (Fixen et al. 2012). The study used the K addition through\ninorganic and organic sources and the removal by key crops to estimate the K\nbudget. The authors used data for fertilizer and the total amount of recoverable\nmanure used in different states from various sources (DAC 2011; FAI 2007, 2011).\nThe amount of manure consumed in each state was multiplied by a coefficient, based\non average K content in recoverable manure, to estimate the K 2 O contribution from\norganic sources. The K 2 O removal by crops was calculated by multiplying production with K 2 O removal coefficient (GOI 2020; FAI 2007, 2011). The crops considered in this study were rice, wheat, maize, barley, chickpea, pigeon pea (Cajanus\ncajan (L.) Millsp.), green gram (Vigna radiata (L.) R.Wilczek), lentil (Lens culinaris\nMedik.), moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq.) Marechal), groundnut (Arachis\nhypogaea L.), sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), mustard (Brassica juncea (L.)\nCzern.), linseed, (Linum usitatissimum L.) cotton, and sugarcane. The study reported\nlarge negative PNBI K values in northern, western, and eastern regions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe authors attributed the negative PNBI K in most states of India to inadequate\napplication of K, high removal of K by intensive cropping, and export of crop\nresidues. They cautioned that negative PNBI K in soils is not a one-off phenomenon\nbut a recurring one, which will significantly affect the future sustainability of crop\nproduction.\nPatra et al. (2017), using the national soil health card database, highlighted\nsignificant decreases in soil K concentrations in areas of north-western India that\nwere earlier flagged as areas of high negative PNBI K (Fig. 11.6). Recently, Tewatia\net al. (2017) did an extensive analysis of nutrient inputs and outputs for all major\ncrops, including food grains and other cereals, pulses, oilseeds, forages, fiber crops,\nfruits, vegetables, plantation crops, spices, tubers, and sugarcane.

(2017)\n\n\nthe FAI database for fertilizer consumption and crop production data for 2015 and\n2016, and nutrient uptake coefficients were taken from several sources. Only\ninorganic fertilizer contributions were considered as inputs. The authors calculated\na net negative K balance of \u20138.6 Mt of K 2 O, which was 66% of the net negative\nN + P 2 O 5 + K 2 O balance (Table 11.9). The authors further desegregated the K\nbalance information at a crop and land area basis. The average areal negative balance\nwas \u201342.2 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] across all crop groups. It was highest for sugarcane (\u2013121 kg\nK 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ), fruits (\u201371 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ), and plantation crops (\u201358 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ), while\npulses (\u201315 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ) had the lowest K deficit, most likely due to low productivity levels. The negative balance in food grains was \u201340 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] ; however, it\nhas the most profound effect on K balance at the national scale as the major food\ngrain crops (rice, wheat, and maize) cover nearly 80% of the arable land.\n\n\n11.5.3 Potassium Balance at the Cropping System Scale\n\n\nCropping systems strongly influence soil nutrient balance. Two or more crops are\ngenerally grown in a sequence within a year in much of India, except where climatic\nor other factors restrict growing multiple crops. Yadav et al. (1998) illustrated how\nnutrient removal differs by the number of crops grown in sequence and by the type of\ncrops within the cropping system rotation (Table 11.10).\nCareful nutrient and crop management planning is necessary for cropping systems to avoid nutrient imbalances in the soil. Long-term intensive cropping with\ninadequate application of K results in K mining leading to large negative balances\nand depletion of native K reserves (Gami et al. 2001; Regmi et al. 2002; Singh et al.\n2002; Yadvinder-Singh et al. 2005; Majumdar et al. 2016). Therefore, adequate\ninput of K is essential to prevent further depletion of soil K. Fixation of applied K as\nnon-exchangeable K is also not ruled out in K-depleted soils. Evidences suggested\nthat the non-exchangeable K reserves of the mica-rich soils of the Indo-Gangetic\nPlains (IGP) were exhausted due to continued lack of K fertilization in intensive\ncropping, that raised their K fixation capacity (Tiwari et al. 1992; Bijay-Singh et al.\n2003). Singh et al. (2018) stated that short-term inconsistencies, if any, in crop\nresponse to K or changes in exchangeable K content in the soils of the IGP should\nnot guide the K fertilization decisions. Rather, adequate K replenishment matching\nwith annual K removals is required for the long-term sustainability of the rice\u2013maize\nsystem in these soils without impairing soil fertility. Soil K depletion is faster with its\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 309\n\n|Table 11.10 Nutrient removal in impo|ortant cropping syst|tems|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Crop sequencea|Total yieldb|Total crop nutrient removalc|Total crop nutrient removalc|Total crop nutrient removalc|\n|Crop sequencea|Total yieldb|N|P2O5|K2O|\n|Crop sequencea|t ha\u20131|kg ha\u20131|kg ha\u20131|kg ha\u20131|\n|Maize\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|8.2|306|27|232|\n|Rice\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|11.0|328|30|305|\n|Maize\u2013wheat|7.6|247|37|243|\n|Rice\u2013wheat|8.8|235|40|280|\n|Maize\u2013wheat|7.7|220|38|206|\n|Pigeon pea\u2013wheat|4.8|219|31|168|\n|Pearl millet\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|10.0|278|42|284|\n|Pearl millet\u2013wheat\u2013cowpea|19.9d|500|59|483|\n|Soybean\u2013wheat|7.7|260|37|170|\n|Maize\u2013wheat\u2013green gram|9.0|296|47|256|\n|Maize\u2013rapeseed\u2013wheat|8.6|250|41|200|\n\n\n\na Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.)

It is further aggravated when crops remove\nmore K than required as luxury consumption. The data presented in Table 11.11\nindicate that except for the crop sequences with a pulse or potato as component\n\n\n310 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\ncrops, all other sequences remove more K than N and P. The higher output: input\nratio for K compared with N and P indicated insufficient K addition under different\ncropping systems, leading to depletion of soil K (Tiwari et al. 1992; Singh et al.\n2015a, b).\nMulti-locational studies (Singh et al. 2014) revealed that omission of K in rice\u2013\nwheat cropping system resulted in annual mining of 158\u2013349 kg K ha [\u2013][1] from soil\nreserves, and the authors cautioned that continuous inadequate application of K in\nthis cropping system may not be able to sustain high productivity over time. In a\n\n\u2013\nlong-term experiment on rice rice rotations at Gazipur in Central Bangladesh, Mazid\nMiah et al. (2008) reported that rice grain yield decreased sharply in a clay-loam soil\nfrom about 10 t ha [\u2013][1] in 1985 to 6.2 t ha [\u2013][1] in 2000 in the K-omission plots, whereas K\napplication at 50 kg ha [\u2013][1] resulted in positive K balance and maintained rice yields. In\n\n\u2013\nanother study on rice wheat rotations in northwest Bangladesh, the application of\n54 kg K ha [\u2013][1] increased average grain yield by 25\u201330% of rice and wheat by 53\u201386%\nacross a range of demonstration plots on farmers\u2019 fields (Mazid Miah et al. 2008).\nBuresh et al. (2010) showed that near-neutral K balance in rice\u2013wheat cropping\nsystems in India would require 100 and 15% retention of rice and wheat residues,\nrespectively, when irrigation water contributed 125 kg K ha [\u2013][1] . Replacing winter\nwheat with maize in the rice\u2013wheat cropping system, with typical crop management\npractices in India, reduces PNBI K well below \u2013100 kg K ha [\u2013][1], which becomes even\nmore negative at higher system productivity. At a maize grain yield of 12 t ha [\u2013][1],\nthere is a net export of about 200 kg K ha [\ufffd][1], which is often difficult to resupply with\nexternal K applications until and unless crop residues are fully returned to the field.\nResidues are often removed for several reasons. Rice straw has several competitive\nuses. Maize residue is difficult to manage in the field, and N immobilization often\n\n\u2013\noccurs because of high C:N ratios in that residue. Nutrient depletion replenishment\nstudies in the rice-based systems in Bangladesh have also shown negative PNBI K\n(Timsina et al. 2013).\nOn-farm results from the AICRP-IFS (2012) showed negative PNBI K in farmers\u2019\nfields across locations and cropping systems (Table 11.12). Potassium partial nutrient balance intensity was influenced by the crops selected in various cropping\n\nsystems.\nThe \u201cSR+M\u201d treatment received supplemental application of secondary and\nmicronutrients, along with the same amount of N, P, and K as in \u201cSR\u201d (the state\nrecommendation). The addition of secondary and micronutrients to SR triggered\nhigher removal of K in most cases, suggesting that the application of limiting\nsecondary and micronutrients, even at suboptimal application of major nutrients,\nmay increase crop yield and removal of K.\nThe deficit in K supply will cause changes in K soil concentrations.

Several assessments at national and cropping system\nscales showed that K balances are largely negative. Low application rates of K in\ncrops combined with high offtake of K at harvest due to straw and other crop residue\nremoval from farms are the major reasons. The on-farm studies showed declines in\nexchangeable and non-exchangeable K fractions in soils of intensively cultivated\nareas. Potassium fertilization decisions based on agronomic evidence are required to\nimprove crop yields and farm profitability and to maintain K fertility of Indian soils.\n\n\n312 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n11.6 Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\nSoil fertility depletion is considered one of the major factors limiting crop production\nin sub-Saharan Africa. Crop production in soils of low native fertility with little or no\nfertilizer application is depleting and unsustainable. Maintaining the productive\ncapacity of these soils through effective nutrient management remains a major\nchallenge. Nutrient mass balance in specific soil\u2013crop systems is a reliable indicator\nof nutrient depletion or mining.\nWhen estimated at different spatial scales, nutrient balances provide insight into\nsustainability challenges affecting production systems in the short- and long-term.\nAccess, price, and affordability of fertilizers are major production constraints in\nSub-Saharan Africa, especially for K fertilizers. The following sections outline the K\nbalance at various spatial scales in the region and how that affects crop productivity\nin different production systems.\n\n\n11.6.1 Potassium Balance at Continental and Country Scales\n\n\nAnalysis of nutrient balances in sub-Saharan Africa shows consistent negative trends\nthat result from the continuous cultivation of crops for many decades with little\naddition of nutrient inputs in agricultural soils in the region. Annual PNBI K at the\nregional level averages less than \u201315 kg K ha [\u2013][1] and ranges between \u20135 and \u201345 kg K\nha [\u2013][1] for various countries (Stoorvogel et al. 1993; Van den Bosch et al. 1998)\n(Fig. 11.7). The losses of K from the soil translate to about 3 Mt K year [\u2013][1] . The\naverage fertilizer use of 18 kg ha [\u2013][1] of N+P+K in sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in\nthe world, accounting for less than 2% of the world fertilizer consumption. This is far\nbelow requirements to prevent nutrient depletion. Potassium inputs from fertilizer\nare proportionally lower than N and P, as most fertilizers that are recommended and\nused in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa exclude K. As a result, the amounts of\nK applied as fertilizer are less than 3 kg ha [\u2013][1] . The application of K through organic\nresources is also limited and negligible due to low amounts of manures and crop\nresidues that are available. The removal of K in grain and crop residues and K losses\nthrough erosion and leaching combine to result in severe nutrient depletion. The\naverage yield of cereal crops which covers 80% of croplands is about 1.5 t ha [\u2013][1],\n\n\u2013\naccounting for removal of 20 30 kg K ha [\u2013][1] . Potassium losses due only to erosion in\nsub-Saharan Africa range from 3 to 15 kg of N+P+K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] (Henao and\nBaanante 2006).\nDespite the overall large negative PNBI K in sub-Saharan Africa, nutrient balances\nvary greatly among different cropping systems and agro-ecological zones. The\nlargest losses of 20\u201350 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] occur in the sub-humid savannahs of\nWest Africa and the highlands and sub-humid areas of east Africa and southern\nAfrica, a region with high potential for crop production and high population densities. Moderate K losses of 10\u201320 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] occur in the humid forests and\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 313\n\n\nFig. 11.7 Potassium balances for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. (adapted from Henao and\nBaanante 2006)\n\n\nwetlands of south-central Africa and Sudan. The soils in the arid zones in southern\n\n\u2013\nand West Africa have the lowest K losses (5 15 kg K ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] ), mainly due to low\nnutrient removals from low yields.\n\n\n11.6.2 Potassium Balance at the Regional Scale\n\n\nPotassium partial nutrient balance intensities for regions within countries are highly\nvariable, similar to the patterns of K balances at the continental level. For example,\nPNBI K levels in Kenya are consistently negative, and range from \u20135 to \u201334 kg K ha [\u2013][1]\n\nyear [\u2013][1] (Henao and Baanante 2006) (Table 11.13). The Rift Valley region with the\nlowest balances is characterized by high potential crop production and intensive\ncultivation, while the highest nutrient balances in northeastern Kenya is associated\nwith arid conditions that result in both low crop yields and nutrient removals.\nRelatively higher K fertilizer use in the central Kenya Rift Valley is due to large\nareas of tea, coffee, and sugarcane production that receive recommended fertilizers\ncontaining K.\n\n\n314 K.

At such scales,\nvariability is driven by soil-forming factors, such as the underlying geology and\nposition on the landscape, jointly termed the \u201csoilscape\u201d (Deckers 2002). In contrast,\nvariation in soil fertility associated with resource management at the farm level has\ngenerally been overlooked, despite evidence that such operations affect K balances\nand productivity of both crops and livestock (Smaling and Braun 1996; Giller et al.\n2006). In addition, there are strong indications that K balances differ widely among\nfarms in different wealth categories and among plots at different distances from\nhomesteads (Shepherd and Soule 1998).\nDifferences in access to fertilizer by farmers contribute significantly to the\nvariability of fertilizer use. Farmers with more access to fertilizer use greater\namounts of mineral fertilizers (Tittonell et al. 2005) and tend to own more cattle\nand thus manure, thereby using significant quantities of nutrients (Swift et al. 1989;\nAchard and Banoin 2003). Consequently, K accumulates on farms with more access\nto resources, often at the expense of the poorer farms.\nWithin farms, soil fertility status of different plots on smallholder farms in\nsub-Saharan Africa may vary considerably due to both inherent factors and different\nresource management strategies (Tittonell et al. 2005). Smallholder farms consist of\nmultiple plots managed differently in terms of allocation of crops, fertilizers, and\nlabor resources, resulting in within-farm soil fertility gradients caused by management strategies a common feature (Zingore et al. 2007). In most cases, both organic\nand mineral fertilizer resources are preferentially allocated to the part of the farm\nused for growing the main food-security crop, often close to the homestead, while\nplots further away are neglected. Such management decisions culminate in the\ncreation of gradients of decreasing soil fertility with distance from the homestead\n(Elias et al. 1998; Vanlauwe et al. 2002). Even where small quantities of manure and\nmineral fertilizers are available, farmers still apply them at high rates by\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 315\n\n\nconcentrating them in small areas. For instance, farmers in Zimbabwe apply cattle\nmanure at amounts as high as 80 t ha [\u2013][1] year [\u2013][1] by concentrating cattle manure on\npreferred plots (Mugwira and Murwira 1998). The underlying reasons for targeting\nof nutrient resources to few fields are not fully understood, but important factors\ninclude farm size, distance of different plots from the homestead, restricted availability of fertilizers and manures, availability and efficiency of labor use, risk of\ntheft, and the need to reduce the risk associated with erratic rainfall (Nkonya et al.\n2005).\nPotassium application in African agriculture is low. Most of the farmland in\nAfrica is dependent on soils that experienced some level of erosion and nutrient\nmining. The exchangeable K concentrations of the soil are generally low because of\nthe high degree of weathering and a long history of crop production without proper\nsoil management. Farmers\u2019 wealth, resource management strategies, and access to K\nfertilizers all contribute to significant variation in largely negative K balances across\nAfrican soils. Improved access to K fertilizers and their site-specific management are\nkey to increasing or even just maintaining the productive capacity of these soils.\n\n\n11.7 North Africa\n\n\nThe North Africa region is dominated by the Mediterranean climate, with rainfall\nduring the colder winter and dry and hot during the summer. The soils of this region\nare varied but generally low in organic matter. In arable lands, the predominant soils\nare calcimagnesic, fersialitic, and clay-rich vertisols. Major land areas of North\nAfrica are under arid and semi-arid climate zones. Although lack of sufficient rainfall\nis the main limitation of crop production, nutrient deficiencies also limit crop\nproductivity. Even though most of the research undertaken in North Africa in the\n1980s reported that soils are well supplied with K (Ghanem et al. 1983; El Oumri\n1985; Stitou 1985), continuous withdrawal of soil K has led to a decline in soil\nfertility. Several areas in North Africa now report low exchangeable K and high\nspatial variability of K in soils (Badraoui et al. 2003). As K availability in soils of\nmost North African countries (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) is perceived to be\ngenerally adequate (Azzaoui et al. 1993; Mhiri 2002; Belouchrani et al. 2002),\nfertilizer K consumption has remained very low, with an average of 12% of the\ntotal consumed N, P, and K (FAOSTAT 2018). Potassium partial nutrient balance\nintensities show negative trends due to crop K removal with none or low K inputs. In\nsome rainfed areas, farmers do not fertilize crops with K, even when it is required,\ndue to the relatively high cost of fertilizer, which has led to visible K deficiency\nsymptoms in crops in the last few decades (Mhiri 2002). For wheat, the main annual\ncrop of the region, fertilizer recommendations are based mainly on N and P, while K\napplication is generally neglected. Research on K also became limited in the last\ndecades with the most recent research programs on K undertaken more than\n30 years ago.\n\n\n316 K.

Since the K\nbalance in these studies accounted only for K output by grain removal, greater K\ndeficits would be expected in areas where wheat straw is also removed from the field\nfor off-farm use. Previous research demonstrated that critical levels of K in soils\n\ndepends on soil types and crop yield performances (Badraoui et al. 2002; Aissa and\nMhiri 2002). There are large differences in K use between rainfed and irrigated areas.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 317\n\n\n\nTable 11.15 Potassium partial nutrient balance intensity\n(PNBI K ) of irrigated wheat in\nsandy soils of the Saharan area\n(South Ouargla) of Algeria\n\n\n\n|K addition|K removal in grain|PNBI<br>K|\n|---|---|---|\n|kg K ha\u20131|kg K ha\u20131|kg K ha\u20131|\n|0|13.86|\u201313.86|\n|60|22.13|38.87|\n|120|31.27|88.73|\n|180|38.66|142.34|\n\n\nHalilat (2004)\n\n\n\nThe expansion of irrigated area in North Africa due to incentive programs such as the\nGreen Plan in Morocco and the National Program for Rural and Agricultural\nDevelopment (PNDAR) in Algeria intensified production and increased K removal\nby crops. As a consequence, growers in irrigated areas use more K for industrial\ncrops, fruits, and vegetables. In the citrus sector, which represents one of the main\nexport crops in the region, K plays an important role in fruit quality (Hamza et al.\n2012). For irrigated wheat, research undertaken in the Doukkala region of Morocco\nshowed that wheat responded to added K fertilizer only when the yield was higher\nthan 5 t ha [\u2013][1] (Badraoui et al. 2002). The highest consumers of K fertilizer are\ngreenhouse crop production systems. For example, banana production uses on\naverage of 500 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1], strawberry production uses 400 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1], pepper\n(Capsicum spp.) production uses 140 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1], and potato production uses\n115 kg K 2 O ha [\u2013][1] in northwest Morocco (Zerouali and Mrini 2004).\nIn Tunisia, the status of K in soils differs among three soil categories (Mhiri\n2002): (1) acidic soils in the northwest are generally low in K; (2) alkaline, calcareous, fine-textured soils located in the north are rich in total and exchangeable K, and\nare considered among the most fertile soils in the country; and (3) alkaline, calcareous coarse-textured soils, located in the center and south of the country and the\nSahel, are relatively low to very low in exchangeable K.\nIn Algeria, arable land is limited to less than 3% of the total geographical area.\nApproximately 8.7 Mha are available to grow cash crops, forest, pasture, rangelands,\nand scrub and alfalfa (Laoubi and Yamao 2012). The consumption of K fertilizer in\nAlgeria is low and represents about 11% of the total consumed N, P, and K fertilizer\nin the country (FAOSTAT 2018).\nThere are few studies on K mass balance in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.\nPotassium fertilizers are applied in limited quantities due to perceived high native K\nin soils. Potassium deficiency in crops, however, is increasing due to higher removal\nof K in intensive agricultural production systems with improved irrigation facilities.\nResearch evidence of better crop productivity and quality with site-specific K\nmanagement in the region suggests the need for higher levels of K inputs to crops.\n\n\n318 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n11.8 United States\n\n\nPotassium budgets for the USA were calculated using the NuGIS model (Fixen et al.\n2012). The model calculates K budgets for each county in each state for 1987, 1992,\n1997, 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Briefly, the NuGIS model considers the\nsum of nutrient removal by up to 21 major crops as the only output: alfalfa\n(Medicago sativa L.), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), barley, common bean\n(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), canola, maize grain, maize silage, cotton, hay (various\ncrops other than alfalfa), orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), peanut (Arachis\nhypogaea L.), potato, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugarcane, sunflower,\nsweet corn (Zea mays L.), tobacco, and wheat. The model uses crop-specific K\nremoval rates (g K kg [\u2013][1] yield) and does not consider spatiotemporal variability. The\nnutrient inputs considered by the model are fertilizer and manure.\nA map PNB K for the contiguous 48 states of the USA is shown in Fig. 11.8. A\nPNB K - 1 dominates the more arid western half of the USA where soil K levels have\nhistorically been higher and where K application rates have generally been lower.\nBased on the distribution of PNB K (Fig. 11.8), the USA was divided into four\ngroups, and trends in PNB K over time were assessed (Fig. 11.9). Temporal trends\nwere evaluated through linear regression of the log of PNB K calculated for each\nregional group as well as for the USA.

In the more arid western states (Group C),\n\n\n320 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\nno significant trend emerged over time. Soil K concentrations have historically been\nhigh; consequently, farmers have not applied much K fertilizer, resulting in a higher\nPNB K, averaging 3.63.\nThe widely varied K-balance patterns across the USA arise from interactions of\nclimate, soil properties, cropping patterns, market conditions, governmental policies,\nand many other factors. In general, the combination of rather steady K consumption\nbut increased yields and therefore increased nutrient removal has led to negative K\nbalances that are becoming increasingly negative in much of the USA.\n\n\n11.9 Brazil\n\n\nSince the soil nutrient status of Brazilian soils is generally low, supplying additional\nnutrients is generally necessary to make agriculture effective and profitable. Potassium fertilizer consumption in Brazil is high, with consumption of 5.4 Mt K 2 O in\n2015, ranking second in the world, with about 90% of it imported. A nutrient budget\ncan represent the amount of a nutrient that is exported from the whole country, a\nspecific location (e.g., state), or a field by a crop relative to the amount of applied\nnutrient.\n\nThe nutrient budgets for Brazil have been calculated for the whole country, states,\nand main crops based on fertilizer consumed (ANDA 2010\u20132015), crop production\nfor the eighteen major crops in Brazil, namely banana, common bean (Phaseolus\nvulgaris L.), cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), castor bean (Ricinus communis\nL.), cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), coffee, cotton, maize, orange, peanut, potato, rice,\nsorghum, soybean, sugarcane, tobacco, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and\nwheat (IBGE 2010\u20132015), and the average nutrient concentration in the harvested\nportion of the crops (Yamada and Lopes 1998; Cunha et al. 2010, 2011, 2014).\nThe data from the most recent survey (Francisco et al. 2015) for an average of\n4 years (2009\u20132012) are summarized in Table 11.16. It is important to note that the\nMidwest region was responsible for 34% of the total K fertilizer consumption. This\nregion provides the bulk of soybean and maize production in the country, with\n\n\nTable 11.16 Average (2009\u20132012) annual K partial nutrient balance intensities (PNBI K ) and\npartial nutrient balances (PNB K ) for regions in Brazil\n\n|Region|Crop removal of K|Applied K|PNBI<br>K|PNB<br>K|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Region|Mt K2O|Mt K2O|Mt K2O||\n|South|0.91|0.96|0.05|0.95|\n|Midwest|1.06|1.29|0.23|0.82|\n|Southeast|0.66|1.02|0.35|0.65|\n|Northeast|0.30|0.43|0.13|0.70|\n|North|0.09|0.09|0.00|1.04|\n|Brazil|3.03|3.79|0.76|0.80|\n\n\n\nFrancisco et al.

In summary, PNB K for the whole\ncountry was 0.8.\nNutrient budgets for nine crops grown between the years of 2009 and 2012 are\npresented in Table 11.17. Potassium use was higher than crop removal in most crops,\nwith the exception of beans (1.20). Potassium use was most balanced in soybean,\nwhich had a PNB K of 0.99, followed by rice (0.86) and sugarcane (0.85). Coffee had\nthe lowest PNB K value (0.20).\nSoybean, maize, and sugarcane are responsible for about 70% of the K fertilizer\nconsumed in Brazil. The PNB K levels for these crops are very reasonable, compared\nto other situations worldwide, which is indicative that Brazil has had fairly appropriate use of K for these crops.\nIn terms of states (data not shown), there is a wide range of results in terms of K\nmass balance, with some states presenting very low and others very high PNB K\nlevels (ranging from 0.54 to 3.17 in the main agricultural states). The results from\nstudies at specific locations with K mass balances allows researchers to focus on\ncrops or regions with the most severe deficits. For example, coffee and citrus were\ntwo of the most important crops in Brazil with the lowest levels of PNB K among all\ncrops considered in the study. Consequently, it is necessary to better study fertilizer\npractices and management systems that could increase NUE, leading to improved\nPNB K levels for both crops.\nIn order to extend this analysis back to represent PNB for N, P, and K prior to\n2009, trends in mass balances of these nutrients between 1988 and 2012 are provided\nin Fig. 11.10. Nitrogen removal was higher than N input until the late 1990s. Later,\nN use in the country increased due to the adoption of more intensive cropping\nsystems with higher inputs, especially for sugarcane, orange, coffee, and maize,\n\n\n322 K.

Phosphorus PNB\n(PNB P ) has essentially hovered around 0.60, which may be acceptable when compared to estimates of 0.30 in many situations. Potassium partial nutrient balances had\na similar decreasing trend as N, and PNB K reached 0.67 in 2012. Potassium showed\na dramatic increase in PNB K in 2009 (0.98) that reflected a significant and temporary\ndecrease in K use by farmers due to higher fertilizer prices. The generally steady\ngrowth in nutrient use in Brazil in recent years has been effective in improving crop\nproduction, increasing average yields. In 1990, the average yield was around 1.70 t\nha [\u2013][1] and subsequently increased to 3.44 t ha [\u2013][1] 20 years later.\nNutrient mass balances were estimated periodically to help identify gaps in\nfertilizer use for specific crops or regions as well as to forecast future nutrient\ndemands. In this context, initiatives aimed at educating farmers and agronomists\non how to assess the performance of nutrient inputs are crucial for promoting\nfertilizer use efficiency, minimizing nutrient loss, and increasing crop production\nsustainability. With this in mind, a new tool was developed recently by Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o de\nPlantas Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (NPCT) in Brazil which allows the calculation of\nspecific nutrient mass balances at the farm level (NPCT 2020). Many agronomists\naround the country are using this tool to calculate nutrient mass balances for different\ncrops and farms.\nCalculation and publication of nutrient mass balances have helped agricultural\nstakeholders to better understand the status and efficiency in the use of different plant\nnutrients. For Brazil, the PNB K indicates generally appropriate ratios. Between 2009\nand 2012, the average PNB K value was 0.80, which means that overall, 80% of the\nfertilizer applied to crops was exported as agricultural products. The recently\nreleased web tool to calculate nutrient mass balances at the farm level is helping\nfarmers around the country better manage fertilizers. This tool can be adapted for use\nin other regions.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 323\n\n\n11.10 Southern Cone of Latin America\n\n\nThe total agricultural area of the five countries of the Southern Cone of Latin\nAmerica (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) is 238 Mha over a\ntotal land area of 513.6 Mha. Total arable land represents approximately 22% of the\nagricultural area. The total area for different crop groups defined by FAOSTAT is\n56.5 Mha. Field crops (oil crops, coarse grain, and cereals) lead the area and\nproduction in the region.\nThe main field crop areas of the Southern Cone include the Pampas and Gran\nChaco regions of Argentina and Uruguay, the southern highlands of eastern Paraguay, the eastern lowlands of Bolivia, and the central valleys and southern volcanic\nregions of Chile.\nSeveral soil associations are found in this region. Mollisols are dominant through\n\u2013\nout the Pampas Chaco plains and Uruguay and are among the best suited for\nagriculture because of their high native fertility. Alfisols are also widespread in the\n\n\u2013\nPampas Chaco region. Alfisols are generally fertile, with a high concentration of\nnutrient cations. Ultisols and Oxisols are the main soils in eastern Paraguay. These\nsoils have good physical qualities but require high lime and phosphorus inputs.\nVertisols are mainly located in the central-eastern region of Argentina, in the Entre\nRios province, as well as in Uruguay. The vertisols have good nutrient concentrations, but challenging soil physical properties that demand careful management.\nAlluvial soils dominate the eastern lowlands of Bolivia and also have good natural\nsoil fertility. Soils of Chile are quite variable and include Alfisols, Mollisols,\nEntisols, and Inceptisols in the central region, and Entisols, Inceptisols, Andisols,\nand Ultisols in the south. Native soil K availability is high in most of the cropping\nareas of the Southern Cone of Latin America (Barbaz\u00e1n et al. 2012; Sainz Rozas\net al. 2013). Thus, fertilizer K consumption in the region has been low, about\n335\u2013425 kt K 2 O in the last years (summed across the individual country consumptions shown in Fig. 11.11). However, expansion of agriculture into new areas and\nreplacement of pastures by annual crops, mainly soybean, in the last 20 years\n(Wingeyer et al. 2015) have increased K removal by grains and induced K deficiencies in several regions of Uruguay (Barbaz\u00e1n et al. 2012, 2017), and some areas of\nParaguay and Argentina.\nIn Argentina, the apparent consumption of K as fertilizers reached a peak of 54 kt\nK 2 O (44 kt K) by 2007 (Fig. 11.11). An annual PNB K has been estimated for the four\nmajor grain crops (soybean, corn, wheat, and sunflower) considering K application\nand grain K removal (Garc\u00eda and Gonz\u00e1lez Sanjuan 2016). This estimation used\naverage grain K concentration for the four crops and assumed that crop residues were\nnot removed from fields, a typical practice under no-tillage agriculture in Argentina.\nThe PNB K has been very high, with K removal exceeding K application by\nalmost 800 times during the period 2012\u20132014 (Fig. 11.12). Negative K mass\n\n\u2013\nbalances have reduced soil K availability (0 20-cm depth) to the current soil test\nK levels of 370\u2013750 mg K kg [\u2013][1] in agricultural fields in the central Pampas (Correndo\net al. 2013). This is a 32\u201362% reduction from the pristine (pre-agriculture) soil test K\n\n\n324 K.

Areas in northwestern Argentina under continuous sugarcane production for more than 50 years without K inputs\nhave decreased soil K concentrations to low enough levels that crops now respond to\nK fertilization (P\u00e9rez Zamora 2015).\nConsumption of fertilizer K in Bolivia is very low, with an annual average of\napproximately 4.4 kt during 2012\u20132014 (FAOSTAT 2017).

Continuous\nremoval of soil K without replacement will eventually result in soil fertility declines\nadversely affecting crop yields and farm profitability.\nMancassola and Casanova (2015) estimated a comprehensive nutrient balance for\nagricultural production of Uruguay. In their study, nutrient removal was estimated\nfor: field crop production; beef, dairy, and wool production; fruit and vegetable\nproduction; and forest production. Nutrient concentrations were gathered from local\ninformation and from literature. Nutrient application was estimated from fertilizer\nimports. In 2010, estimated PNBI K was approximately \u201324 kt K 2 O (\u201320 kt K)\n(Fig. 11.14). These negative PNBI K levels were observed for most of the production\nsystems because of low K fertilization rates, with the exception of vegetables and\nfruits. Furthermore, as soybean area increased in the last two decades, PNBI K in the\nsoil has become more negative due to the high K requirements of soybean. Considering an average grain K content in 3.6 Mt of soybean exports, it is estimated that\napproximately 63 kt K 2 O was removed from the soil in 2014. In addition, agriculture\nhas also expanded to marginal soils in the north-central and eastern regions of the\ncountry, where soils with low soil test K levels are common (Fig. 11.15). As a result,\nK deficiencies in crops have been evident since the early 2000s (Barbaz\u00e1n et al.\n2012, 2017).\nMost of Paraguay\u2019s agricultural production takes place in the eastern half of the\ncountry on lateritic soils (mainly Oxisols and Ultisols) and includes soybean as a\n\n\n326 K.

Causarano\nMedina (2017) estimated nutrient mass balances for the period between 1996 and\n2015, considering K fertilizer imports and K removal with soybean, maize, wheat,\nrice, sunflower, and canola crop production. Figure 11.16 shows that PNB K in\nParaguay has decreased from 3 to 4 in the period between 1996 and 2003 to a\nPNB K between 2 and 3 since 2003. Despite this improvement in PNB K, it is still\nmuch greater than 1, indicating that soil K reserves are being heavily relied upon to\nprovide K for an increasingly productive agriculture. Recent surveys indicate that\n58% of soil samples are above soil test K critical levels [> 0.5 cmol(+) kg [\u2013][1] or\n195 mg K kg [\u2013][1] (Causarano Medina 2017).\nIn summary, countries of the Southern Cone of Latin America generally have\nPNB K levels > 1, with correspondingly negative PNBI K values, indicating depletion\nof soil K. In most of the region, crop production under these negative PNBI K levels\nhas been sustained from high levels of soil K reserves. However, K deficiencies and\npositive crop responses to K fertilization have been detected in areas such as\nUruguay because of the continuous decline in the exchangeable and\nnon-exchangeable soil K fractions. Site-specific evaluations of soil test K would\nprovide information on the rate of decline of soil K supplies. Lastly, K application\ndecisions based on soil test calibrations would be required to sustain high crop yields\nand farm profitability and to maintain soil K fertility.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 327\n\n\nFig. 11.15 Pristine (pre-agricultural) soil test K concentrations at a depth of 0 to \u201320 cm, according\nto the soil recognition guide of Uruguay. (Califra and Barbazan unpublished)\n\n\n11.11 Conclusion\n\n\nEstimates of K mass balance provide insight into soil K fertility trends and potential\nshort- and long-term impacts of nutrient management practices in crop production\nsystems. The availability of reliable data to calculate K mass balances differs among\ngeographies. This is reflected in the scale, both spatial and temporal, and resolutions\nat which K balances are estimated and reported in this chapter. Table 11.18 demonstrates that the quantity of information used to estimate PNB K and PNBI K varies\namong assessments. Common to all, however, are estimates of K removed in\n\n\n328 K. Majumdar et al.\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015\n\n\nFig. 11.16 Potassium partial nutrient balance (PNB K ) estimates from 1996 to 2015 for field crop\nagriculture in Paraguay.

Besides the\navailability and access to quality data, a large diversity of land use and methodological differences in estimating K mass balances are also responsible for divergent\nmetrics reported from various parts of the world. Farmer income levels, access to\ninformation on K nutrition of crops, and translation of scientific knowledge to\nchanges in nutrient management practices also play important roles on how K\nmass balances develop in a specific soil\u2013crop context. This reinforces the concept\nthat nutrient balances are highly contextual and must be interpreted accordingly.\nNevertheless, PNB and PNBI K reported in this chapter, provide a useful global\noverview of how K is managed in crops, cropping systems, or in mixed enterprises.\nNutrient balances are too often reported as snapshots of a year or one cropping cycle,\nbut the trends over time are perhaps the most diagnostic of the sustainability of a\ngiven cropping system and its fertilization practices.\nTemporal changes in soil K balance over decades at national scales are useful to\nprovide necessary policy guidance for production, distribution and use of K fertilizers. China is such a case. The highly negative PNBI K levels in soils of China in the\n1980s have now changed to generally positive PNBI K levels, arising from increased\nawareness at the policy and user level, better access to K fertilizers, and their proper\nuse in the field.\nThe spectrum of PNBI K is tilted more toward the negative side globally as more K\nis removed with each harvest than applied. Potassium applications are typically low\nin historically high K soils (e.g., countries in the Latin America Southern Cone,\nNorth Africa, Western USA), due to an historic lack of crop yield responses.\nHowever, crops growing in some soils in these regions are now responding to K\nfertilizer applications, and crops are more frequently showing deficiency symptoms\nwhen no K is applied. A combination of negative PNBI K and crop response to K\nfertilizer is an unambiguous indication of K fertility decline.\n\n\n11 Assessing Potassium Mass Balances in Different Countries and Scales 329\n\n\n|Input|Atm. deposition|Col3|Col4|Col5|X|X|Col8|X|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|Col25|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Input|Planted biomass||||X|X|||||||||||||||||||\n|Input|Erosion|||||||X|||||||||||||||||\n|Input|Run-off|||||||X|||||||||||||||||\n|Input|Irrigation||||X|X||X|||||||||X||||||||\n|Input|Org. fert.||||X|X|X|X|X|X|||||||X|||X|||||\n|Input|Inorg. fert.|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|\n|Mass balance metric (PNBK or PNBIK)|Mass balance metric (PNBK or PNBIK)|PNBIK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBK|PNBIK|PNBK|PNBK, PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBIK|PNBK, PNBIK|PNBK, PNBIK|\n|Fig or table|Fig or table|Fig. 11.1|Fig. 11.2|Fig. 11.3|Fig. 11.4|Fig. 11.5|Fig. 11.6|Fig. 11.7|Fig. 11.8|Fig. 11.9|Fig. 11.10|Fig. 11.12|Fig. 11.14|Fig. 11.16|Table 11.2|Table 11.5|Table 11.7|Table 11.8|Table 11.10|Table 11.11|Table 11.12|Table 11.13|Table 11.14|Table 11.15|\n\n330 K.

The general perception is\nIndian soils are inherently rich in K and do not require further K fertilizer applications; however, overwhelming evidence of negative PNBI K levels at national,\nregional, and cropping system scales, accompanied by large crop yield losses\nwhen no K fertilizer is applied suggest that site-specific K management is necessary\nto maintain soil K fertility. Negative PNBI K levels and PNB K levels greater than\nunity indicate that a certain portion of crop requirements are derived from native K\nreserves. Irrespective of the soil K status, this process depletes soil K. How soon the\ngradual K depletion will impede crop production is a function of the magnitude of\nthe soil K reserve and the level of cropping intensity. Evidence suggests that soils\nwith very high K reserves will eventually become depleted under intensive cropping\nwhen adequate K fertilizer is not applied (the PNB K levels are much greater than 1),\ngiving credence to K mass balance as a reliable indicator of soil K mining.\n\n\nAcknowledgments The Grains Research and Development Corporation supported the research\ninto Australian farm level nutrient performance indicators reported here and the involvement of Ms\nElaina vanderMark and Southern Farming Systems is acknowledged.

The main goal of this study was therefore to investigate\nbiomass and nutrient [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)] content,\npartitioning, stoichiometry and internal efficiencies in sugarcane ratoon at varying yield\n\nlevels. Three sites were established on highly weathered tropical soils located in the\nSoutheast region of Brazil. At all sites, seasonal biomass and nutrient uptake patterns\n\nwere synthesized from four sampling times taken throughout the sugarcane ratoon\nseason. In-season nutrient partitioning (in diverse plant components), internal efficiencies\n(yield to nutrient content ratio) and nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K) were determined at\n\nharvesting. Sugarcane exhibited three distinct phases of plant growth, as follows: lag,\n\nexponential\u2013linear, and stationary. Across sites, nutrient requirement per unit of yield was\n\n1.4 kg N, 0.24 kg P, and 2.7 kg K per Mg of stalk produced, but nutrient removal varied\nwith soil nutrient status (based on soil plus fertilizer nutrient supply) and crop demand\n\n(potential yield). Dry leaves had lower nutrient content (N, P, and K) and broader N:P and\n\nN:K ratios when compared with tops and stalks plant fractions. Greater sugarcane yield\nand narrowed N:P ratio (6:1) were verified for tops of sugarcane when increasing both N\n\nand P content. High-yielding sugarcane systems were related to higher nutrient content\nand more balanced N:P (6:1) and N:K (0.5:1) ratios.\n\n\nKeywords: _Saccharum_ spp., nutrient uptake, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, biomass, internal efficiencies\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nBrazil is the world\u2019s largest sugarcane ( _Saccharum_ spp.) producer, with approximately 9 million\nhectares (ha) cultivated for biofuel, sugar, and electricity production (UNICA, 2015). In the\nlast decade, cultivated sugarcane area in Brazil increased by about 4 million ha, primarily\nin the Southeast and Midwest regions. The latter expansion was explained by the significant\nincrease in bioethanol consumption by flex-fuel light-duty vehicles (Adami et al., 2012).\n\n\n**Abbreviations:** CEC, cation exchange capacity; DAH, days after harvest; DAP, days after planting; DRIS, diagnosis and\nrecommendation integrated system; GDDs, growing degree days; GPS, global positioning system; HI, harvest index; HSS,\nhumic substances solution; NIE, nutrient internal efficiency; NUE, nutrient use efficiency; RIE, reciprocal internal efficiency.\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 1 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\n\nThe increase in cropland area is growing in parallel with\ntechnology investments implemented by sugarcane growers,\nsuch as machinery for planting and harvest operations. Due\nto environmental, agronomic, social, and economical reasons,\nmanual harvest with prior burning of sugarcane has been\nreplaced by harvesters, where dry leaves and tops (developing\nleaves and meristem) are now left over the soil surface,\nrepresenting an input from 10 to 20 Mg ha [\u2212][1] year [\u2212][1] of dry\nbiomass (Fortes et al., 2013; Leal et al., 2013; Trivelin et al., 2013).\nThis new harvest system has been called \u201cgreen cane management\nsystem,\u201d where \u223c80% of the Brazilian sugarcane fields previously\nharvested by hand with burning are currently harvested without\nburning by harvesters (Leal et al., 2013). In S\u00e3o Paulo, largest\nsugarcane-producing state, the crop is cultivated in 4.7 million ha,\nand more than 85% of the total is mechanically green harvested\n(UNICA, 2015).\nThe adoption of the green cane management system coupled\nwith other management practices (e.g., precision agriculture\ntools) may modify nutrient requirements for modern sugarcane\ncultivars. Traditional approaches to the mineral nutrition of\nsugarcane included a strong emphasis on yield with a focus\non a balanced nutrition, economic productivity, and quality\n(Kingston, 2014). Balanced nutrition implies that all essential\nnutrients needed for proper growth and ripening of sugarcane\nare available (Kingston, 2014). Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K)\nare demanded in large amounts by the crop, ranging from 150\nto 400 kg ha [\u2212][1] (Silva and Casagrande, 1983; Shukla et al., 2009;\nOliveira, 2011; Mariano et al., 2016) for sugarcane yield varying\nfrom 70 to 180 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Nitrogen is a major nutrient for plant\ngrowth and tillering processes (Kingston, 2014), while K plays a\nkey role on osmoregulation, which is important for cell extension,\nstomata movement, and enzyme activation (Epstein and Bloom,\n2005; Shukla et al., 2009; Kingston, 2014). Phosphorus (P) is also\nessential for tillering, root and shoot growth (Kingston, 2014).\nIn highly weathered tropical soils, usually characterized by low\nnutrient availability, monitoring the fertility status and fertilizer\n(NPK) application are essential practices to achieve and sustain\nhigh sugarcane yield levels (Franco et al., 2011; Oliveira, 2011;\nTrivelin et al., 2013).\nFor sugarcane, the nutrient ratio concept (also termed as\nnutrient stoichiometry) is not a new tool for diagnosing nutrient\nimbalances. Beaufils and Sumner (1976) developed the DRIS to\nevaluate N, P, and K requirements of sugarcane irrespective of\nplant age. Imbalances of these nutrients can be detected by means\nof DRIS before a deficiency can be diagnosed securely by means\nof threshold values (Beaufils and Sumner, 1976; Meyer, 1981).\nHowever, nutrient ratios investigated were unstable. Nutrient\nratios (N:P and N:K) changed during the stage of sugarcane\ndevelopment (Meyer, 1981). This occurs, because there is a\ncomplex interaction and dynamics of these elements within the\nsoil-plant system (Meyer, 1981; Shukla et al., 2009; Mariano et al.,\n2016). Besides this complexity, these studies did not properly\naddress the role of the nutrient ratios relative to the sugarcane\nyield. Second, previous research on nutrient ratios (N:P and\nN:K) for sugarcane probably were carried out in fields harvested\nwith prior burning, a different condition to the current and\nfuture scenario. More than 70% of the total organic matter and\n\n\n\nnutrients contained in the sugarcane straw are emitted to the\natmosphere via burning prior manual harvest (Mitchell et al.,\n2000). Therefore, the straw layer left over the soil surface when\nthe crop is mechanically harvested without burning represents\na significant input of organic C and nutrients to the soilplant system, which can result in long-term benefits for the\nsustainability (via C sequestration) and nutritional requirements\n(by decreasing fertilizer needs) of sugarcane systems (Trivelin\net al., 2013). Likely, nutrient ratios correlate with sugarcane yield\nin the green cane management system, but further investigations\nare required for examining this new research area.\nBrazil is one of the largest consumers of fertilizer, with\na nutrient demand expected to rise in the foreseeable future\n(IPNI, 2015). However, the country strongly depends on the\ninternational fertilizer market, especially for N (78%) and\nK (90%). A feasible strategy to reduce this dependency is\nto increase NUE, measured as sugarcane yield to nutrient\ncontent ratio (so called \u201cphysiological efficiency\u201d). Management\noptions for improving NUE from a cropping system perspective\nmust also consider both NUE components: nutrient recovery\nand physiological efficiencies (Cassman et al., 2002; Ciampitti\nand Vyn, 2012). In sugarcane, little is known about NUE\nfor green cane management systems. Vieira-Megda et al.\n(2015) investigated the effect of fertilizer N sources and rates\non sugarcane productivity, without documenting changes in\nbiomass accumulation. Similar results were reported by Otto et al.\n(2013), where among six sugarcane N-response trials, only one\nsite showed high yield response ( _>_ 25%) to fertilizer N. Probably,\nlack of adequate balance on nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K)\ncan act as yield-limiting factor in the green cane management\nsystem. Nutrient balances can help in closing yields gaps and\nimprove NUE. Therefore, plant nutrient ratios are valuable tool\nfor diagnosing crop nutrient imbalances (Ciampitti and Vyn,\n2014). The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize\ninformation on biomass and nutrient (N, P, and K) content,\npartitioning, stoichiometry, and internal efficiency indexes in\nsugarcane ratoon at varying yield levels at three site-years.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nSite Characteristics and Sugarcane\nGenotypes\nThree N-response trials for sugarcane fertilization were carried\nout in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Southeast region of Brazil. Two\nsite-years were performed during the 2009/2010 growing season\n(Sites 1 and 2), while the remaining experiment (Site 3) was\nconducted in the 2012/2013 season. At all sites, experiments\nwere established in the first ratoon cycle, and the plant cane\n(previous cycle) was harvested without burning the residues,\nleaving a straw layer (formed by dry leaves and tops) over the soil\nsurface. Conventional tillage (plowing, disking, harrowing, and\nfurrowing) and soil correction (application of lime and gypsum)\nwere performed, on average, every 6 years at all sites. Site 1 was\nlocated in Piracicaba (22 [\u25e6] 35 [\u2032] S; 47 [\u25e6] 37 [\u2032] W), in a Typic Hapludox\nsoil (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Plant cane (cultivar SP89-1115,\nreleased by Copersucar) was mechanically green harvested in\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 2 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\n\nMay 2009, at 433 DAP. Site 2 was located in Santa Cruz das\nPalmeiras (21 [\u25e6] 47 [\u2032] S; 47 [\u25e6] 11 [\u2032] W), in a Typic Eutrustox soil (Soil\nSurvey Staff, 2014). Plant cane (cultivar SP81-3250, released by\nCopersucar) was also mechanically green harvested in June 2009\n(456 DAP). Further details related to soil characteristics and\nfertilizer and by-product management history for Sites 1 and 2\ncan be found in Mariano et al. (2015) and Vieira-Megda et al.\n(2015). Site 3 was located in Sever\u00ednia (20 [\u25e6] 46 [\u2032] S; 48 [\u25e6] 45 [\u2032] W), in a\nTypic Eutrustox (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). The cultivar planted\nwas RB855453 (released by Ridesa), and the plant cane was\nharvested without prior burning in August 2012, at 442 DAP.\nAs related to the genotypes, cultivar SP89-1115 is marketed as\nearly ripening, average for yield potential, sucrose and fiber levels;\ncultivar SP81-3250 has a middle ripening, with high sugarcane\nyield potential, sucrose and fiber levels; and cultivar RB855453 is\nearly ripening, but also with high yield potential and sucrose, and\naverage fiber levels (Tasso J\u00fanior, 2007; Ridesa, 2010).\n\n\nSoil Characterization and Experimental\nSetup\nBefore the onset of the field trial, four composite soil samples\n(obtained by combining and mixing nine individual samples\ninto a single sample per block) were taken at 20-cm soil\ndepth intervals until 100-cm soil layer for soil physicochemical\ncharacterization. Soil pH was determined with 0.01 mol L [\u2212][1]\n\nCaCl 2 (ratio of 1:2.5 for soil and solution \u2013 w/v; van Raij et al.,\n2001). Soil organic C was determined by wet oxidation following\n\n\n\nthe Walkley\u2013Black procedure (Nelson and Sommers, 1996).\nAvailable P, K, calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were extracted\nby ion-exchange resins, and then quantified by colorimetric (P),\nflame photometric (K), and atomic absorption spectroscopic\n(Ca and Mg) methods (van Raij et al., 2001). Sulfur (SO 4 [\u2212][2] S) was extracted with Ca(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 solution and determined by\nturbidimetry, while exchangeable aluminum (Al) was extracted\nwith KCl solution and then determined by titration (van Raij\net al., 2001). CEC at pH 7.0 was measured by summation of\nexchangeable cations (K, Ca, and Mg) and potential acidity\n(H + Al). Base saturation was calculated by dividing the\nsummation of exchangeable cations by CEC, and then multiplied\nby 100. Clay content was determined by the densimeter method\n(Gee and Bauder, 1986). Physicochemical soil properties are\ndisplayed in **Table 1** .\nThe experimental design within each location was a\nrandomized complete block with four (Sites 1 and 2) or\nfive (Site 3) replications. At Site 1, treatments were fertilizer\nN sources [ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, calcium\nammonium nitrate, organo-mineral fertilizer, urea, and control\n(no-N added)], applied at a rate of 100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] . For Site\n2, in addition to the above-cited treatments applied at Site 1,\nammonium sulfate (100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] ) was also used. At Site 1,\nplots were fertilized with 75 kg K ha [\u2212][1], while 125 kg K ha [\u2212][1]\n\nand 15 kg P ha [\u2212][1] were added at Site 2. The sources of K\nand P used at both sites were KCl and triple superphosphate,\nrespectively. At both sites, fertilizers were manually applied over\nthe straw layer, in a band at 20 cm away from the plant row.\n\n\n\nTABLE 1 | Selected physicochemical soil properties at the 0- to 100-cm soil layer before the onset of field trials cropped with sugarcane at three sites, all\nlocated in the Southeast region of Brazil.\n\n\nDepth cm pH SOC [a] g dm **[\u2212]** [3] P S K Ca Mg Al CEC [b] BS [c] % Clay g kg **[\u2212]** [1]\n\n\nmg dm **[\u2212]** [3] mmol c dm **[\u2212]** [3]\n\n\nSite 1 (Typic Hapludox soil [d] )\n\n\n0\u201320 4.6 23 29 33 4.3 13 6 5 95 24 510\n\n\n20\u201340 4.6 19 29 50 4.6 29 12 5 126 36 530\n\n\n40\u201360 4.3 19 5 95 4.9 13 8 11 124 21 500\n\n\n60\u201380 4.1 14 2 107 5.5 8 6 13 117 17 580\n\n\n80\u2013100 4.2 13 1 105 4.0 9 8 13 109 19 530\n\n\nSite 2 (Typic Eutrustox soil [d] )\n\n\n0\u201320 5.5 17 8 27 0.7 49 13 0 91 69 630\n\n\n20\u201340 4.8 13 16 92 0.3 33 10 2 85 51 630\n\n\n40\u201360 4.6 10 2 116 0.2 19 8 4 69 39 640\n\n\n60\u201380 4.7 8 1 117 0.2 16 7 2 57 41 660\n\n\n80\u2013100 4.9 7 1 113 0.1 16 7 1 57 40 660\n\n\nSite 3 (Typic Eutrustox soil [d] )\n\n\n0\u201320 5.4 9 28 12 3.0 18 9 1 49 61 299\n\n\n20\u201340 5.3 7 33 30 1.4 15 9 3 47 54 226\n\n\n40\u201360 5.2 5 3 47 1.0 13 10 2 41 58 252\n\n\n60\u201380 5.2 5 2 50 0.8 14 10 1 39 64 298\n\n\n80\u2013100 5.2 4 2 49 0.8 12 11 1 33 71 275\n\n\na _Soil organic C._\nb _Cation exchange capacity at pH 7.0._\nc _Base saturation._\nd _Classification refers to the Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014)._\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 3 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\nFor Site 3, treatments used were rates of HSS (35 g organic\nC kg [\u2212][1] ; 115, 230, and 460 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] ), N (25, 50, and\n100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] ) and specific interactions between both factors\n(115 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] + 25 kg N ha [\u2212][1], 230 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] + 50 kg\nN ha [\u2212][1], and 460 kg HSS ha [\u2212][1] + 100 kg N ha [\u2212][1] ). A control\ntreatment (without addition of HSS and N) was also used.\nHumic substances were composed by fulvic and humic acids,\nboth extracted and purified from peat, whereas N was applied\nas urea. The HSS and HSS + N treatments were applied\ndirectly to sugarcane leaves (foliar application), while N rates\nwere banded added over the straw layer, at 20 cm away from\nthe plant row. Treatments were added on September 2009,\nOctober 2009, and October 2012 at Sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\nPhosphorus and K recommendations were defined based on\nsoil test methods ( **Table 1** ), whereas target yield concept was\nemployed to predict fertilizer N requirements (Spironello et al.,\n1997). Biweekly precipitation and mean biweekly minimum and\nmaximum air temperatures recorded at each site are displayed in\n**Figure 1** .\n\n\n\nBiomass and Plant Nutrient Content\n\nMeasurements\n\nPlant measurements followed similar protocols at all sites, and\na complete description can be found in Mariano et al. (2016).\nBriefly, plants were randomly collected from 3-m plant row\n(\u223c30 plants) in each experimental plot, and then separated into\nstalks, dry leaves, and tops at all four sampling times (comparable\ngrowth stages in all sites). In our study, tops refer to developing\n(green) leaves from the stalk breakpoint to the apical meristem.\nSampling dates of plant biomass were performed at 139, 178,\n235, and 330 DAH for Site 1; at 133, 170, 227, and 331 DAH\nfor Site 2; and at 145, 198, 290, and 380 DAH for Site 3. Fresh\nsamples were weighed and then ground in a forage grinder.\nSubsamples of each plant component were oven dried at 65 [\u25e6] C\nuntil achieving constant weight, then weighed for dry weight\ndetermination, and ground to pass through a 0.5-mm sieve\nin a Wiley mill. Total N, P, and K concentration (g kg [\u2212][1] ) in\nplant tissues were determined by steam distillation (Kjeldahl),\ngravimetry, and flame emission photometry, respectively (AOAC\nInternational, 2006). Total aboveground biomass accumulation\n(expressed in Mg ha [\u2212][1] ) was determined by the summation of\nall plant components collected in each sampling date. Total N, P,\nand K content (kg ha [\u2212][1] ) in each plant component was calculated\nby multiplying each nutrient concentration by its respective\nbiomass value (in dry weight). Final aboveground biomass and\nnutrient content were estimated based on the last sampling date\nperformed at each site. Sugarcane yield (Mg ha [\u2212][1] ) was estimated\nbased on the fresh matter of stalks collected from 3-m plant row\nin the last sampling date.\n\n\nBiomass and Nutrient Partitioning\nSeasonal biomass partitioning in dry leaves, stalks, and tops\nof sugarcane collected along the ratoon cycle was fitted using\na sigmoid equation for estimating the crop growth modeling\n(Mariano et al., 2016). The following equation (Eq. 1) was then\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1 | Biweekly precipitation and mean biweekly minimum and\nmaximum air temperatures during a sugarcane growing season (first\nratoon cycle) conducted at Site 1 (A), Site 2 (B), and Site 3 (C), all\nlocated in the Southeast region of Brazil.\n\n\nused to predict seasonal biomass within each plant component:\n\n\n_Y_ = _Y_ max (1)\n{1 + exp \u2212[ _(_ DAH \u2212 _A)/B_ ]}\n\n\nwhere _Y_ is the aboveground biomass (Mg ha [\u2212][1] ); _Y_ max is the\nmaximum aboveground biomass (Mg ha [\u2212][1] ) from harvest of the\nplant cane to harvest of the first ratoon; DAH is days after harvest\nof plant cane; _A_ and _B_ are constants.\nNutrient (N, P, and K) partitioning among each plant\ncomponent along the ratoon cycle was fitted using a Gaussian\nequation (Eq. 2) as follows:\n\n\n\n\ufffd 2 [\ufffd]\n\n\n\n_Y_ = _Y_ 0 + _A_ \u00d7 exp\n\n\n\n_DAH_ \u2212 _B_\n\n\ufffd\u22120 _._ 5 \u00d7 \ufffd _C_\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 4 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al.

In this\nstudy, _t_ _b_ was taken as 12 [\u25e6] C, an appropriate value for sugarcane,\naccording to Allison et al. (2007). For terminology purposes, the\nterm \u201caboveground\u201d will be used throughout the text to refer to\nbiomass and nutrient content in the following plant components:\ntops, dry leaves, and stalks.\n\n\nHarvest Index and Nutrient and\nReciprocal Internal Efficiencies\nHarvest index was calculated as the stalks to the aboveground\nbiomass ratio (all determined in dry weight basis) obtained in\nthe last sampling date performed at each site. Similarly, nutrient\nHI for N, P, and K were determined as the nutrient content\nin the stalk as related to the total content in the aboveground\nplant fraction. NIE (kg stalks kg [\u2212][1] nutrient) was defined as\nthe final sugarcane yield (converted from Mg ha [\u2212][1] to kg ha [\u2212][1] )\nproduced per kg of nutrient content (N, P, and K) in aboveground\nbiomass component according to Ciampitti and Vyn (2012).\nTherefore, the following equation (Eq. 3) was then used for the\nNIE calculation:\n\n\n\nSY\nNIE =\n\ufffd WNC\n\n\n\n(3)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nwhere NIE is nutrient internal efficiency; SY is the sugarcane yield\n(kg ha [\u2212][1] ); and WNC is the whole-plant (aboveground) nutrient\n(N, P, and K) content (kg ha [\u2212][1] ).\nIn addition, the RIE (kg nutrient Mg [\u2212][1] stalk) was calculated\naccording to Ciampitti and Vyn (2012), following the equation\n(Eq. 4):\n\n\n\nWNC\nRIE =\n\ufffd SY\n\n\n\n(4)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nsugarcane yield versus the aboveground nutrient content and\nstalk nutrient content for N, P, and K was assessed through nonlinear regressions. The model adjusted was validated utilizing\npreviously published studies (Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al.,\n2010; Schultz et al., 2010) as to demonstrate the fitness and\nrobustness of model calibration. The relationship between N\ncontent versus P and K content were also performed aimed to\nevaluate the N:P and N:K ratios within each plant component. All\nfitted regressions were determined using the SigmaPlot graphing\nsoftware (version 11.0, 2008, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA,\nUSA). The aboveground biomass accumulation, nutrient content,\nNIE, and RIE values obtained from all sites were stratified into\ndiverse sugarcane yield ranges ( _<_ 80, 80\u2013100, 100\u2013120, 120\u2013140,\n140\u2013160, and _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ).\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nAt the three sites, precipitation totals during the sugarcane\ngrowing season (equivalent to 12 months) were above the local\naverage ( **Figure 1** ). At Site 1, precipitation reached 1,862 mm\nand was 1.5-fold higher than the 81-year average (1,230 mm;\n**Figure 1A** ); precipitation at Site 2 totaled 1,691 mm and was\n1.3-fold greater than the 29-year average (1,330 mm; **Figure 1B** );\nat Site 3, cumulative precipitation (1,310 mm) was slightly\nsuperior than the 17-year average (1,266 mm; **Figure 1C** ). The\nair temperatures recorded at each site ( **Figure 1** ) were similar\nto historical average. At Site 1, minimum air temperature varied\nfrom 9.5 to 20.0 [\u25e6] C, while maximum air temperature ranged from\n24.2 to 32.9 [\u25e6] C. At Site 2, minimum air temperature ranged from\n11.8 to 20.6 [\u25e6] C, while maximum air temperature varied from 24.2\nto 31.5 [\u25e6] C. Lastly, at Site 3, minimum air temperature varied from\n12.0 to 21.4 [\u25e6] C, and maximum air temperature ranged from 25.7\nto 34.7 [\u25e6] C.\n\n\nBiomass, Nutrient Content, and Harvest\nIndex\n\nA broad range in aboveground sugarcane biomass was recorded\nacross all sites ( **Table 2** ). Sugarcane yield ranged from 67 to\n211 Mg ha [\u2212][1], averaging 125 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Aboveground biomass\nranged from 16 to 106 Mg ha [\u2212][1], averaging 57 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Stalk\nbiomass ranged from 9 to 66 Mg ha [\u2212][1], averaging 37 Mg ha [\u2212][1],\nwhile tops mass ranged from 2 to 30 Mg ha [\u2212][1] and averaged 11 Mg\nha [\u2212][1] . Dry leaves biomass ranged from 4 to 20 Mg ha [\u2212][1], with\nan average of 9 Mg ha [\u2212][1] . Nutrient content within each plant\ncomponent also had a broad variation ( **Table 2** ). The content\nof N, P, and K in the stalks ranged from 32 to 168 kg ha [\u2212][1],\nfrom 5 to 57 kg ha [\u2212][1], and from 26 to 713 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively.\nThe content of N, P, and K in the dry leaves ranged from 19 to\n77 kg ha [\u2212][1], 0.6 to 4.9 kg ha [\u2212][1], and 2 to 96 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively.\nLastly, the content of N, P, and K in the tops ranged from\n17 to 225 kg ha [\u2212][1], 1 to 26 kg ha [\u2212][1], and 75 to 396 kg ha [\u2212][1],\nrespectively. As related to the aboveground plant fractions (dry\nleaves + tops + stalk), N content ranged from 86 to 425 kg N\nha [\u2212][1], averaging 197 kg N ha [\u2212][1], while P content ranged from 10\nto 79 kg P ha [\u2212][1], averaging 32 kg P ha [\u2212][1] ( **Table 2** ).

This approach was previously used by\nSetiyono et al. (2010) for corn. For all the parameters studied,\ndescriptive statistics was determined through calculating mean,\nstandard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 25\u201375% quartile.\nThe equations used to predict seasonal biomass and nutrient\npartitioning (Eqs. 1 and 2) among plant components (stalks,\ndry leaves, and tops) were chosen based on their higher _R_ [2]\n\nvalues than other functions tested.

The biomass HI had a narrow range,\nvarying from 0.55 to 0.73 across all evaluated sites ( **Table 2** ).\nIn contrast, nutrient HI showed a broad range, varying from\n0.31 to 0.64 for N, 0.38 to 0.81 for P, and 0.12 to 0.82 for K.\nDetailed results about biomass accumulation, nutrient content,\nand HI for each specific treatment within each site can be found\nin **Supplementary Table 1** .\n\n\nBiomass and Nutrient Partitioning\nSugarcane biomass accumulation throughout the ratoon cycles\nwas characterized by a sigmoid pattern ( **Figure 2A** ). The nonlinear growth regression equation included data from all sites,\nand three distinct growth phases were identified, as follows: (1)\nPhase I (lag phase): from \u223c0 to 135 DAH (0 to 1450 [\u25e6] C GDDs),\nthis period is marked by a slow plant growth, accumulating\n\u223c10% of the final aboveground biomass relative to harvest; (2)\nPhase II (exponential\u2013linear phase): from \u223c135 to 270 DAH\n(1450 to 2800 [\u25e6] C GDDs), this period was characterized by a rapid\ngrowth that produced \u223c65% of the final aboveground biomass\nrelative to harvest; and (3) Phase III (stationary phase): from\n\u223c270 to 370 DAH (2800 to 4000 [\u25e6] C GDDs), this period exhibited\na declined growth, representing \u223c25% of the final aboveground\nbiomass at harvest. As related to the nutrient uptake, 50% of\n\n\n\nthe total N, P, and K content occurred at 212 (2259 GDDs), 209\n(2292 GDDs), and 214 DAH (2314 GDDs), respectively, while\n50% of biomass accumulation was detected at 250 DAH (2700\nGDDs; **Figures 2B\u2013D** ). Thus, there was an asynchrony (delay) of\n\u223c38 days, on average, between the date when 50% of the total\naboveground biomass occurred in comparison when 50% of total\nnutrient had accumulated.\nIn the partitioning process, Phase I was marked by the biomass\nallocation exclusively in the tops, as the occurrence of dried\nleaves and stalk was not visible at that growth stage ( **Figure 2A** ).\nHowever, an opposite trend was observed for Phases II and III,\nwhere most of the biomass was allocated in the stalk, followed by\ntops and dry leaves. The fraction of biomass allocated in the stalk\nwas \u223c65% of the total, which are similar toother studies, ranging\nfrom 60 to 80% (Coale et al., 1993; Inman-Bamber et al., 2002;\nShukla et al., 2009; Trivelin et al., 2013). The nutrient partitioning\nfollowed the same trend as verified for biomass accumulation\n( **Figures 2B\u2013D** ), although a higher proportion of N, P, and K were\nallocated in the tops than dry leaves in the Phases II and III.\n\n\nYield-to-Nutrient Content Relationship\nSugarcane Yield\nSugarcane yield was positively related to the aboveground and\nstalk nutrient content, with a less than proportional change\nfor nutrient content under high-yielding stalk observations\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 6 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al.

Both N and P showed a narrow relationship with\nsugarcane yield ( _R_ [2] \u2265 0.66), but K presented wider variability,\nthus resulting in non-significant relationships ( _R_ [2] \u2264 0.13;\n**Figures 3C,F** ). For the yield-to-K relationship, Site 1 showed\na range varying from 356 to 866 kg K ha [\u2212][1] for a comparable\nyield level ( **Figure 3C** ), whereas for Site 2, K and P may have\nlimited sugarcane yield with similar stalk K (70 kg ha [\u2212][1] ) and P\n(9 kg ha [\u2212][1] ) content, with yield ranging from 65 to 120 Mg ha [\u2212][1]\n\n( **Figures 3E,F** ).\n\n\nN:P and N:K Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\nPlant Components\nEvaluation of nutrient stoichiometry can provide an overall status\nof nutrient balance at a specific growth stage. Following this\nrationale, N:P ratio was established for all plant components\n(stalk, dry leaves, and tops) at harvest time ( **Figure 4** ). Bubble\ngraphs portrayed N:P content association as relative to sugarcane\nyield (represented by bubble sizes; **Figure 4** ). At the aboveground\nbiomass level, N:P ratio presented an overall balance close to 6:1\nunits ( **Figure 4A** ), although the N:P ratio changed relative to the\nplant fraction: 18 units for dry leaves ( **Figure 4B** ), 6 unit for\ntops ( **Figure 4C** ), and 4 units for the stalk organ ( **Figure 4D** ).\nThe tops followed a similar N:P ratio as documented for the\naboveground plant, which exemplify the critical role of this\norgan for C fixation and growth/yield, with a variation from\n\n\n\n3:1 to 11:1 ( _<_ threefold; **Figure 4C** ). High-yielding sugarcane\nobservations presented a more balanced N:P ratio (6:1 units).\nFor example, sugarcane yield of 120 Mg ha [\u2212][1] resulted in 70 kg N\nha [\u2212][1] and 12 kg P ha [\u2212][1] (N:P of six units) for the tops component\n( **Figure 4C** ).\nThe stoichiometric evaluation was also calculated for N and\n\nK, but more variation was present than the N:P ratio. The overall\nN:K ratio was of 0.5:1 units, ranging from 0.1:1 to 1.2:1 ( _>_ 10-fold\nvariation; **Supplementary Figure S1** ). Accordingly to the N:P\nratio, the N:K stoichiometry presented a similar variation range\nin the tops component relative to the aboveground biomass.\nDetailed information about nutrient ratios (N:P and N:K) for\ntreatments used at each site can be found in **Supplementary**\n**Table 1** .\n\n\nEfficiency Indexes on Diverse Sugarcane\nYield Ranges\nAs expected, both biomass and nutrient content followed\nthe yield pattern ( **Table 3** ). In low-yield levels, marked by\nyields _<_ 80 Mg ha [\u2212][1], the aboveground biomass was of 26 Mg\nha [\u2212][1], whereas aboveground nutrient content was of 117, 16, and\n233 kg ha [\u2212][1] of N, P, and K, respectively. However, under highyield levels ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ), the biomass was of 89 Mg ha [\u2212][1],\nwhile nutrient content was of 279, 50, and 560 kg ha [\u2212][1] of N, P,\nand K, respectively.\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 7 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al.

Each data point represents an individual field plot at sugarcane harvest of a first ratoon growing season for three\nsite-years ( _n_ = 102). Red symbols were gathered from previously published documents (Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al., 2010; Schultz et al., 2010; _n_ = 27).

Maximum NIEs [713 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] N,\n5962 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] P, and 478 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] K] occurred at lowest\nsugarcane yield ( _<_ 80 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ), while minimum NIEs [623 kg\nstalk kg [\u2212][1] N, 3649 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] P, and 320 kg stalk kg [\u2212][1] K]\noccurred at highest sugarcane yield ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ). Reciprocal\ninternal efficiencies were estimated for low and high sugarcane\nyields (from 80 to 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ), requiring 1.3\u20131.6 kg N, 0.21\u2013\n0.28 kg P, and 2.4\u20133.2 kg K per Mg of stalk produced, respectively\n( **Table 3** ). Oliveira (2011) reported a similar trend for RIE, with\nvalues of 1.5, 0.21, and 3.1 kg of N, P, and K, respectively.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThe high yielding observations reported in this study were\ngreater than previous sugarcane yield values documented by\nothers researchers in Brazil (Gava et al., 2005; Prado and\n\n\n\nPancelli, 2008; Oliveira, 2011; Amaral and Molin, 2013; Fortes\net al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Rossato et al., 2013), Australia\n(Thorburn et al., 2011) and United States (Coale et al., 1993;\nMcCray et al., 2014). In this study, Site 3 represents a highyielding and productive sugarcane environment, likely explained\nby the combination of high soil fertility and utilization of best\nmanagement practices, such as variable rate fertilizer spreader\nand controlled traffic through GPS guided maps. It is recognized\nthat sugarcane yield depends on the complex interaction among\ngenotypes, environment (soil and weather), and management\npractices (Thorburn et al., 2011). Several factors can contribute\nto the scatter and non-linear differences in yield that affect\nits relationship between nutrients (Setiyono et al., 2010). In\nthis study, weather conditions, such as air temperature and\nprecipitation, were similar for all sites ( **Figure 1** ), with a main\ndifference related to the soil type and fertility status ( **Table 1** ).\nFor example, in Site 1, average pH (4.3 units) and base saturation\n(23%) were relatively low at all evaluated soil-depth intervals,\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 8 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\nFIGURE 4 | Relationships between N versus P content for all plant components: aboveground biomass (A), dry leaves (B), tops (C), and stalks (D).\nEach data point represents an individual field plot at sugarcane harvest of a first ratoon growing season for three site-years ( _n_ = 102). Dotted lines show boundary\nratios for each component between N versus P, and black line shows the average value.\n\n\n\naccompanied with high Al content (9.5 mmol c dm [\u2212][3] ) when\ncompared to Site 3 ( **Table 1** ). For Site 2, the main limiting\nfactors were K (0.3 mmol c dm [\u2212][3] ) and P (5.6 mg dm [\u2212][3] ) levels.\nIn summary, Sites 1 and 2 presented initial soil conditions that\ncould constraint and severely affect sugarcane yield potential\nrelative to Site 3. In agreement, Dias et al. (1999), documented\na strong correlation between sugarcane yields and chemical\nproperties (e.g., CEC, base saturation, exchangeable Ca, Mg, and\nAl, potential acidity, etc.) of subsurface horizons (25\u2013150 cm) of\nsix weathered soils. Treatment effect was more pronounced on\nSites 1 and 2 than Site 3 ( **Supplementary Table 1** ), which was\nlikely due to variations in soil chemical properties as described\nabove.\nAlthough the aboveground N content presented a broad\nvariation, the overall absolute value was similar with others\nstudies (Wood et al., 1996; Oliveira et al., 2010; Franco et al.,\n2011). Wood et al. (1996) documented total N content values\nranging from 212 to 254 kg N ha [\u2212][1] for several sugarcane\ncultivars. Franco et al. (2011) found total N content values\nranging from 95 to 154 kg ha [\u2212][1], while sugarcane yield ranged\nbetween 77 and 122 Mg ha [\u2212][1] at the same study sites (Franco\net al., 2015). Oliveira et al. (2010) reported that N content ranged\nbetween 94 and 260 kg N ha [\u2212][1], while sugarcane yield ranged\nfrom 120 to 232 Mg ha [\u2212][1] for 11 sugarcane cultivars under\nirrigation in northeastern Brazil. Differences in N content could\nbe explained by the higher yields obtained in the present study\n(average of 125 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ). Other N sources rather than mineral\nfertilizer (e.g., soil N mineralization, atmospheric deposition,\n\n\n\nand biological N fixation by endophytic bacteria) can provide\ndifferent amount of N for sugarcane crop (Urquiaga et al., 2012;\nMariano et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2013; Vieira-Megda et al., 2015).\nFor this study, aboveground P content presented a similar range\nfrom 21 to 39 kg P ha [\u2212][1] as reported by several researchers\n(Rakkiyappan et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2009; Oliveira et al.,\n2010). As related to the K content, Coale et al. (1993) and Shukla\net al. (2009) reported lower values for K content removal by crop\nharvest of 340 and 228 kg K ha [\u2212][1] with sugarcane yield of 96 and\n80 Mg ha [\u2212][1], respectively. For our study, high K content might\nhave been influenced by the soil nutrient content presented at\nSite 1, where soil K level was \u22654.0 mmol c dm [\u2212][3] throughout the\nsoil profile ( **Table 1** ). This experimental site has a long history\nof annual applications of vinasse and press mud. As vinasse has\na high K content, amendment of this by-product might have\ngradually enriched soil K content (Resende et al., 2006). Thus,\nscientific literature is available portraying the critical role of\nsustaining an adequate K content for increasing sugarcane yields\n(Shukla et al., 2009).\nUnder optimal water, solar radiation, and temperature\nconditions, nutrient supply is the primary limiting factor\naffecting the process of biomass accumulation (Donaldson et al.,\n2008; van Heerden et al., 2010).

The slow growth is\nrelated to the slow tillering and leaf production during plant\nestablishment (Bell and Garside, 2005; Allison et al., 2007).\nPhase II is characterized by an exponential\u2013linear biomass\naccumulation, consisting in leaf canopy and stalks production.\nAfter canopy establishment, the sugarcane is high efficient in\nconverting intercepted light into biomass (Rae et al., 2005;\nAllison et al., 2007). The last stage (Phase III) is marked by\nthe crop ripening and consequent sucrose accumulation in the\nstalk organ. Low air temperatures, reduced precipitation, and\nlow-light photoperiod are important factors for the sugarcane\nripening (Inman-Bamber et al., 2002; Cardozo and Sentelhas,\n2013). At all sites, nutrients were accumulated in a linear\nfashion approach during Phase II as related to the potential\nyield production in each environment. However, in mid-point\nof Phase III, there was a decrease in the N and K content\nfor all components (stalks, tops, and dry leaves; **Figure 2** ).\nThus, we have two hypothesis for this nutrient changes close\nto physiological maturity (ripening): (1) nutrient remobilization\nfrom aboveground plant components to belowground organs,\nsuch as roots and rhizomes (Andersson et al., 2005; Lim et al.,\n2007); and (2) specific to N allocated in the tops and dry\nleaves, foliar emissions of ammonia via stomata can occur\nduring the leaf senescence, reducing the N content in plant\ntissues (Britto and Kronzucker, 2002; Epstein and Bloom,\n2005).\nDissection of plant components for studying biomass HI\nis critical for understanding efficiency and potential yield for\nsugarcane. Inman-Bamber et al. (2002) suggested that the\nbiomass HI (stalks to the aboveground biomass ratio) might\nbe variable due to the amounts of straw (dry leaves and tops)\nrecovered during the sampling procedure of sugarcane age field.\nIn this investigation, dry leaves and tops comprised sugarcane\nstraw, whereas tops are the plant component that accumulates\nthe greatest amounts of nutrients (\u223c60% N, \u223c75% P, and\n\u223c80% K) as compared to dry leaves ( **Figure 2** ; **Table 2** ).\nAccording to Trivelin et al. (2013), since dry leaves have low\nnutrient content, tops is a critical plant component that should\nremain as a crop residue to sustain long-term soil fertility.\nHowever, excessive stalk lodging in sugarcane fields (caused by\n\n\n\nhigh yields and winds) may lead to low return of the tops\nas straw component, since the whole plant is processed by\nthe harvester rather than prior cutting of tops and its direct\ndeposition on the ground. In this scenario, contribution of\nnutrients released from the straw for sugarcane nutrition can\nbe less significant. From the nutrient HI results ( **Table 2** ), the\nN replacement concept (Thorburn et al., 2011), based on the\nfertilizer N application to replace the N removed from the\nsystem (stalk harvested), is a promising way to recommend\nfertilizer needs for sugarcane not only for N, but also for\nP and K. This approach may deliver superior environmental\noutcome without reducing sugarcane yield. However, as HI\nwas not constant for any nutrient (ranging from 0.12 to 0.82,\nconsidering N, P, and K), future research on robust models\nfor optimizing the replacement concept is needed (Setiyono\net al., 2010). Low nutrient HIs for sugarcane should be\nconsidered as a better plant trait, in opposite to the biomass\npartitioning (HI), since more nutrients are retained in nonharvested plant components (straw) and then released to\nthe soil through leaching (for K) and mineralization (for N\nand P).\nNutrient-yield relationships for N and P presented a narrowed\nvariation for both stalks and aboveground plant relative to\nK variation on those plant organs ( **Figure 3** ). Potassium is\nthe most important nutrient in the osmoregulation process,\nwhich is important for cell extension and stomata movement\n(Shukla et al., 2009; Kingston, 2014). We can speculate that\nthe tops (functional leaves) have kept more balanced nutrient\nratios for metabolic functions (Groot et al., 2003; G\u00fcsewell,\n2004). Nutrient surplus (e.g., Site 1, with high K content in\nthe soil) can be storage in other component (stalk organ),\npresenting a low N:K ratio (0.09:1) than tops (functional\nleaves; **Supplementary Figure 1** ). In corn, Ciampitti and Vyn\n(2014) documented a more balanced N:P (5:1) and N:K\n(1:1) ratios under high-yielding environments. In a review\nanalysis, Sadras (2006) showed consistent N:P ratio differences\namong grain crops, 4:1 for oilseed, 6:1 for cereal, and 9:1\nfor legume. Similar N:P ratio, 5:1 units, was synthesized by\nCiampitti and Vyn (2014), in a historical and global analysis\nperformed for corn crop. On the opposite side, dry leaves (less\nfunctional tissues) presented the largest N:P ratio, 18:1 units\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/) 10 [April 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 466](http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Science/archive)\n\n\nLeite et al. Nutrient Partitioning and Stoichiometry in Sugarcane\n\n\n\n(ranging from 6:1 to 51:1 units; **Figure 4D** ). Sugarcane yield\ninfluence was not clearly individualized for the N:P ratio of\ndry leaves, but lower nutrient content was observed in this\nplant component with a larger reduction on P (fivefold) in\nrelation to N (twofold) when compared with the tops organ\n( **Figures 4B,C** ). A higher N:P ratio in dry leaves is explained\nby the remobilization of nucleic-acid P to young leaves and\nthe lower P demand of mature tissues (Usuda, 1995; G\u00fcsewell,\n2004).\nA balanced nutrient approach is critical to sustain functional\ntissues and to promote C fixation, growth, and increase sugar\ncontent in the sugarcane production (Allison et al., 1997, 2007;\nZhao et al., 2014). From our study, nutrient content have a\nbroad range of variability related to stalk yield levels ( **Table 3** ).\nFor example, aboveground N, P, and K contents ranged from\n117\u2013280, 16\u201350, and 233\u2013560 kg ha [\u2212][1], respectively, from low\n(\u226480 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ) and high yielding sites ( _>_ 160 Mg ha [\u2212][1] ),\nrespectively. Nutrient internal efficiencies can be described as\nthe ability of a plant to transform nutrients acquired from all\nsources (e.g., soil, fertilizer, and atmosphere) into economic yield\n(Cassman et al., 2002; Dobermann, 2007; Ciampitti and Vyn,\n2014), in this case represented as sugarcane yield. The higher\nvalues of NIE found in low-yielding environments represents\na dilution of that nutrient in the plant, and is related to its\ndeficiency. In contrast, low values of NIE observed in highyielding environments represent an accumulation of that nutrient\nin the plant, and two hypothesis may explain this pattern,\nas follows: to (1) a restriction in its internal utilization due\nto other limiting factors; and (2) an excessive uptake (also\ntermed as \u201cluxury consumption\u201d) of K, beyond the amount\nrequired for stalk production (Setiyono et al., 2010). Similar\nresults as obtained in this investigation were reported by\nSetiyono et al. (2010) and Ciampitti et al. (2013) for corn,\nwith lowest NIEs as the crop was reaching high-yield potential.\nThe RIE values reported here are ( **Table 3** ) similar but higher\nfrom those documented by Silva and Casagrande (1983) and\nGopalasundaram et al. (2012), which ranged from 0.56\u20131.20 kg\nN, 0.13\u20130.35 kg P, and 0.6\u20131.9 kg K per Mg of stalk produced.\nLower nutrient requirements presented in previous studies are\nassociated to low yield levels, coupled to interactions among\ngenotype, environment, and management (Dias et al., 1999;\nThorburn et al., 2011; Gopalasundaram et al., 2012). From the\nsoil perspective, nutrient availability can limit crop acquisition,\nthus leading to lower biomass and stalk production ( **Table 1**,\n**Figure 3** ). In high productivity systems, fertilization of N, P, and\nK is essential to replenish stalk nutrient removal in order to\nsustainably maintain high yield levels. Therefore, soil test remains\nas a powerful diagnostic tool to quantify nutrient availability\nand subsequent fertilizer needs (McCray et al., 2014). In Brazil,\nhowever, N recommendation for sugarcane is based on the target\nyield concept (Cantarella et al., 1998), where soil N supply, the\nmain source of N to the crop (Franco et al., 2011), is entirely\nneglected. Thus, a soil testing capable to predict _in situ_ N\nmineralization in sugarcane fields is critically needed.\nIn summary, nutrient ratios can provide useful information\nfor sugarcane growers as related to understanding crop nutrient\nbalances and improving fertility diagnosing systems. To extend\n\n\n\nof our knowledge, this study is the first one in synthesizing\ndata in nutrient ratios and yield potential for sugarcane crop.\nA main constraint on this analysis is related to when the data\nwas collected, all at harvest time, which it did not allow the\nutilization of this information for in-season fertility management.\nA temporal analysis on nutrient ratios involving multiple inseason sampling times is needed in order to provide timely\ninformation on nutrient management recommendations for\nsugarcane crop. Future research should be focus on connecting\nsoil and plant processes for identifying the main factors not only\naffecting nutrient ratios but also their relationship to the yield and\nplant biomass components.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nSeasonal biomass accumulation presented three growth\nphases (lag, exponential\u2013linear, and stationary) during the\nratoon growing season. In overall, improvement in stalk\nyields was tightly connected to superior aboveground biomass\naccumulation. Additionally, high yielding sugarcane was\ncorrelated with higher nutrient content, more balanced and\nnarrowed nutrient ratios, and higher efficiency in producing\neach unit of stalk per unit of nutrient accumulated. The nutrient\npartitioning evaluation portrayed lower nutrient (N, P, and K)\ncontent in the dry leaves fraction but with a high N:P ratio\nrelative to the top plant component. Greater sugarcane yield and\nnarrowed N:P ratio (6:1) were documented for tops fraction as N\nand P content increased.\nStalk yield gap can be closed by better balancing nutrient ratios\nthat can be achieved by better understanding complex plant-soil\npathways related to nutrient uptake and plant utilization. This\nsynthesis analysis not only provides a descriptive summary on\nthe variation of nutrient ratios at harvest at varying sugarcane\nyield levels, but also established a foundational concept on\ninvestigating nutrient ratios by dissecting plant components.\nFrom a pragmatic standpoint, further research is needed\nfor integrating the replacement concept in decision nutrient\nmanagement support tools for assisting sugarcane producers on\nthe farming decision-making process.\n\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: JL, IC, EM, MV-M,\nand PT.

A two-year field experiment was\nconducted with combined application of three N rates (135, 180, and 225 kg ha [-1],\ndenoted as N1-N3) and four K rates (0, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha [-1], denoted as K0-K3)\nusing super indica hybrid rice cultivar Yixiangyou (YXY) 2115 to explore the effects of\n\nco-application of N and K on rice growth and development. The results indicated\nthat the combined application of N and K had significantly interactive effects on dry\nmatter (DM) accumulation, nutrients absorption, N harvest index (NHI), K harvest\nindex (KHI), spikelets per panicle and most rice quality indexes. The highest total DM\naccumulation (17998.17-19432.47 kg ha [-1] ) at maturity stage was obtained under\n\nN3K2. The effect of co-application of N and K on nutrients absorption and\n\nutilization varied between the two years and within each year. The highest total\nN and K accumulations at maturity stage were observed under N3K1 and N3K2,\nrespectively, while the highest N recovery efficiency (NRE) and K recovery efficiency\n(KRE) were observed under N1K3. High expression levels of N and K metabolism\nrelated genes in rice grains were observed under N3K2 or N3K3, consistent with N\nand K uptake. Co-application of N and K increased rice yield significantly and the\nhighest yield (6745.02-7010.27 kg ha [-1] ) was obtained under N2K2. As more N was\n\ngradually applied, rice appearance quality improved but milling, cooking and eating\n\nquality decreased. Although appropriate application of K could improve rice milling,\n\ncooking and eating quality, it reduced appearance quality. The optimal\n\nmilling, cooking and eating quality were obtained under N1K2, while the best\nappearance quality was obtained under N3K0. Overall, a combination of 135-210 kg\nha [-1] N and 115-137 kg ha [-1] K application rates was recommended for achieving\n\nrelatively higher yield and better quality in rice production.\n\n\nKEYWORDS\n\n\nrice, combined application of nitrogen and potassium, nutrient absorption-utilization,\nyield, quality\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 01 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

Over half of China\u2019s population\nrelies on rice as their staple food. Consequently, the advancement of\nrice production holds paramount significance in meeting the living\nneeds of population and ensuring food security (Karthika et al.,\n2023). Nowadays, fertilizers have evolved into the principle source\nof soil nutrient provision. The enhancement of crop yield is\ninseparable from the application of chemical fertilizers, no\nexception for rice production. Approximately 30-50% of global\nincrease in crop yield can be attributed to fertilizer input (Erisman\net al., 2008), while the increase rate for rice yield can attain a notable\n57.4% (Wang et al., 2010a).\nN and K are essential nutrients for rice growth and\ndevelopment, and play important roles in the determination of\nboth yield and quality. The amount of N input in rice production in\nChina significantly surpasses the global average level (Ludemann\net al., 2022). However, there is a discernible decline in the utilization\n\nrate of N, possibly attributed to the persistent escalation of N\napplication rates (Ju et al., 2015). The application rate of N in rice\nproduction in southwest China reaches approximately 180 kg ha [-1],\nyet the absorption and utilization rate of N hovers between 32-37%\n(Zhang et al., 2015). However, due to the more apparent immediate\neffects of N fertilizer application, it is a prominent problem that the\npreference for higher N inputs over the combined application of N\nand K in Chinese rice production (Li, 2017). In contrast to N, the\napplication of K in rice production is often insufficient. Rice is a\ncrop that requires a high amount of K, with an uptake ranging from\n150-300 kg ha [-1] per season, comparable to or even exceeding the N\nuptake (Xu et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2019). Improper application of\nfertilizer will lead to the diminished nutrients utilization efficiency,\nyield reduction, deterioration of rice quality and environmental\npollution, which may have the potential to impact human living\ncondition and the sustainable development of agriculture and\necology (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Hence, the efficiency\nof fertilizer absorption and utilization after application, as well as\noptimization of fertilization methods, should be taken into\nconsideration to mitigate the adverse impacts associated\n\nwith fertilization.\n\nThe hybrid indica rice cultivar Yixiangyou 2115 is currently\nextensively cultivated in southwest China, acclaimed for its high\nquality, substantial yield and resistance to multiple stresses. It was\nidentified as \u201cSuper Rice\u201d in 2015 by the Ministry of Agriculture. So\nfar, it has been widely promoted and applied for more than 1.3\nmillion hectares and become a representative cultivar of hybrid rice\n\nin China. However, limited studies can be found on the cultivation\n\ntechniques aimed at achieving both high yield and high quality for\nthis specific rice cultivar. N and K have certain regulatory effects on\nrice growth and development. The rational application of N and K\ncan significantly enhance fertilizer utilization efficiency, thereby\npositively influencing both rice yield and quality. The phenomenon\nof heavy application of N with a comparably lighter application of K\n\n\n\nis common due to the relative lower cost of N fertilizer and the\n\nestablished fertilization habits, which leads to high yield but low\nefficiency in rice production. Numerous studies have explored the\nindividual effects of N or K on rice growth and development. A\ncomprehensive understanding of the combined effects of N and K\non nutrient absorption, utilization, as well as their impact on rice\nyield and quality, remains an area requiring further systematic\ninvestigation. Therefore, field experiments were conducted with\ncombined application of three N rates (135, 180, and 225 kg ha [-1] )\nand four K rates (0, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha [-1] ) using super indica\nhybrid rice cultivar YXY 2115 to explore the interactive effects of N\nand K on rice nutrients absorption and utilization, yield and quality.\nThe objective of this study was to clarify the optimal ration of N and\nK conducive to achieving both high yield and high quality for YXY\n2115. Also, the expression levels of N and K metabolism-related key\ngenes OsNRT1.1B, OsAMT2;1, OsNR2, OsHAK1, OsHAK5 and\nOsAKT1 were quantified to assess the molecular response of rice\ngrains to different fertilizer application rates. This study was\nexpected to provide a theoretical basis for the optimization and\nimprovement of cultivation methods to achieve high yield, high\nquality, and reduce fertilizer input for rice production in southwest\nChina, as well as the large-scale promotion and application of\n\nthis cultivar.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n\n2.1 Experimental site and materials\n\n\nField experiments were conducted during the growing seasons\nof 2019 and 2020 at the research farm of Sichuan Agricultural\nUniversity, Wenjiang city, Sichuan Province, China (30\u00b070\u2032 N, 103\u00b0\n83\u2032 E). The soil of the plot was clay soil. Prior to the establishment of\nthe field experiment, soil samples from the topsoil layer (0-0.20 m)\nwere analyzed. The climate data and analysis results of the top soil\nlayer were shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively. During rice\ngrowth period in two years, the daily average temperature and\n\nrainfall were 22.78 \u00b0C and 3.69 mm in 2019, and 23.31 \u00b0C and 6.53\n\nmm in 2020, respectively. Super indica hybrid rice cultivar\nYixiangyou 2115 (Sichuan Agricultural University), which is\nwidely cultivated in southwest China with high yield and quality\nwith the whole growth period of 146 days, was chosen and used as\n\nthe test material.\n\n\n2.2 Experimental design\n\n\nTwo factor factorial field trials with three levels of N and four\nlevels of K were conducted in two years, using a randomized\ncomplete block design with three replicates. Twelve treatments\nwere established by the complete combination of three N\napplication rates (135, 180 and 225 kg ha [-1], denoted as N1, N2\nand N3, respectively) and four K application rates (0, 90, 135 and\n180 kg ha [-1], denoted as K0, K1, K2 and K3, respectively).

The area of each test plot was 5.0 m\u00d75.0 m, and\nthe transplant density was 30 cm\u00d725 cm (row spacing \u00d7 plant\nspacing) with one seedling per hill. Urea (N, 46.4%) was used as\nthe N source, superphosphate (P 2 O 5, 12.0%) was used as the\nphosphorus (P) source, and potassium chloride (K 2 O, 60.0%) was\nused as the K source. N fertilizer was used as basal manure and top\ndressing (twenty days after transplanting) at a 6:4 ratio. Basal N, P\n(90 kg ha [-1] ) and K were applied to the soil one day before\ntransplanting. For the fertilizer treatments, ridges with plastic\nfilm were used for separation, and protection lines were\n\nestablished between the treatment blocks to ensure the isolation\n\nof the experimental plots. During the whole growing season, rice\nwas continuously flooded with the river water. Field management,\nincluding the prevention and control of pests and weeds, was\nconducted according to the local cultural practices.\n\n\n2.3 Measurements and methods\n\n\n2.3.1 Dry matter accumulation\nTen representative hills were sampled from each plot based on\nthe average number of tillers at full heading stage (9 Aug 2019 and\n13 Aug 2020) and maturity stage (14 Sept 2019 and 15 Sept 2020),\nrespectively. Samples were then separated into different parts, and\nwere oven-dried at 105\u00b0C for 30 min and then to constant weight at\n\n\n\n80\u00b0C to determine the dry weight. DM of stem-sheath, leaf, panicle,\n\nand total biomass were recorded.\n\n\n2.3.2 Absorption and utilization efficiency of N\nand K\n\nAfter weighted, all dried samples were ground to make powder,\npassed through a 0.20 mm sieve, and digested with a mixture of\nconcentrated H 2 SO 4 and H 2 O 2 to determine N and K\n\nconcentrations. The N concentration was determined using a\ncontinuous flow analyzer (AA3, Seal Analytical Inc.,\nSouthampton, UK) while K was determined using flame\nphotometer (M-410, Sherwood Scientific Ltd., Cambridge, UK).\nThe nutrients absorption and utilization efficiency were analyzed as\nbelow (Wang et al., 2004, 2009).\n\n\nPlant N (K) accumulation amount (kg ha [\ufffd][1] )\n\n\n= Plant N (K) concentration \ufffd Plant DM weight\n\n\nTotal N (K) accumulation amount (kg ha [\ufffd][1] )\n\n\n= The sum of N (K) accumulations in the aboveground parts\n\n\n(stem \ufffd sheath; leaf and panicle)\n\n\nN (K) recovery efficiency (NRE and KRE, % )\n\n\n\nTotal plant N (K) accumulation amount of N (K) \ufffd fertilized plot\n\n=\n\n\ufffd Total plant N (K) accumulation amount of zero \ufffd N (K) plot !\n\n\n=Applied N (K) rate of fertilized plot \ufffd 100%\n\n\n\nTABLE 1 Soil properties of the top soil layer (0-0.20 m) at the experimental sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Years|pH|Organic<br>matter (g\u00b7kg-1)|Total N<br>content<br>(g\u00b7kg-1)|Total P<br>content<br>(g\u00b7kg-1)|Total K<br>content<br>(g\u00b7kg-1)|Available<br>N<br>(mg\u00b7kg-1)|Available<br>P<br>(mg\u00b7kg-1)|Available<br>K<br>(mg\u00b7kg-1)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2019|6.90|27.32|1.81|0.75|10.13|97.16|24.30|77.08|\n|2020|6.39|15.97|1.86|1.11|18.07|86.54|21.68|76.75|\n\n\nN, P, K represent nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, respectively.\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 03 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

The products\nwere quantified using a real-time PCR detection system, following\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions (SYBR Green Master Mix,\n\nVazyme). The rice Actin gene was used as an internal control.\nTreatment without nitrogen fertilizer was used as CK. The PCR\nprimers used were listed in Supplementary Table S5.\n\n\n2.3.4 Yield and yield components\nRice was harvested at maturity stage and the yield in each\nexperimental plot was recorded after measuring moisture content\nand removing impurities. Grain yield was adjusted to a moisture\ncontent of 13.5%. The number of effective tillers per hill was\ndetermined before harvest using 30 plants per plot. A total of 10\nselected plants were separated into single tillers according to the\nmarked date, and were used to measure 1000-grain weight, seedsetting rate, and filled grain number per panicle.\n\n\n2.3.5 Rice quality\nAt harvest, 10 plants from each plot were sampled randomly\nand allowed to dry naturally in the sun to assess rice milling quality,\nappearance quality, eating quality and rapid visco-analyzer (RVA)\nvalue after the material was stored at room temperature for\n\n3 months.\n\n\n2.3.5.1 Milling quality\nAbout 100.0 g rice grains were processed using a rice huller\n(JLG-2118, Taizhou Food Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) to\nobtain brown rice. The brown rice was polished using a rice milling\nmachine (JNMJ-3, Taizhou Food Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang,\nChina) to obtain milled rice. In order to obtain head rice, grain with\na length longer than 3/4 of its total length was separated from the\nmilled rice using a broken rice separator (FQS-13X20, Taizhou\nFood Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China). The brown rice, milled\n\n\n\nrice, and head rice are expressed as percentages of the total\ngrain weight.\n\n\n2.3.5.2 Appearance quality\nThe grain length, width, length/width, chalkiness rate and\nchalkiness degree were determined using a grain appearance\nanalyzer (JMWT12, Dongfu Jiuheng Instrument Technology Co.,\nLtd., Beijing, China).\n\n\n2.3.5.3 Rapid visco-analyzer value\nA 3.00 g sample and 25.0 mL of distilled water were added to a\ntest tube. Pasting properties were measured using an RVA device\n(3-D, Newport Scientific, Sydney, Australia) and analyzed with\nThermal Cycle for Windows software. Viscosity values were\nmeasured in a rapid viscosity analyzer unit (RVU).\n\n\n2.3.5.4 Eating quality\nThe sensory properties of the cooked rice were measured using\na rice sensory analyzer (STA 1B, Satake Asia Co., Ltd., Tokyo,\nJapan). Milled rice (30.00 g) was washed in a stainless-steel\n\ncontainer and then transferred into a 50 mL aluminum box\n\ncontaining 40 mL of water. The milled rice was cooked in a\nmultifunctional, timed food steamer (GF-339, Goodway Electrical\nEnterprise Ltd., Hong Kong, China). After the cooking, the sensory\nproperties of the cooked rice were determined. Cooked rice texture\nproperties were measured using a rice texture analyzer (RHS 1A,\nSatake Asia Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).\n\n\n2.4 Statistical analysis\n\n\nData were analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA),\nand means were compared based on the least significant difference\n(LSD) test at the 0.05 probability level by using SPSS 25.0 (Statistical\nProduct and Service Solutions Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The\nassumptions of variance analysis were tested by ensuring that the\nresiduals were random, homogenous, with a normal distribution\nabout/above a mean of zero (Ali et al., 2013; Abolfazl et al., 2017).\n\nOrigin Pro 2020 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) was used to\ndraw the figures. Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) was used\nto establish the binary quadratic fitting equation and figures.\n\n## 3 Results\n\n\n3.1 Dry matter accumulation\n\n\nDM accumulation in the aboveground organs of rice could be\nenhanced by increasing N application, and could be further\nincreased by applying appropriate K application at high N level\n(Figure 2). The maximum values of DM accumulation in stemsheath, leaf and panicle were observed under N3 at both full\nheading stage and maturity stage. Compared with other\n\ntreatments, the maximum increases of total DM accumulation\n\nwere obtained under N3K2, which were 57.54-66.62% at maturity\nstage. Variance analysis showed that co-application of N and K had\nextremely significant interactive effects on the DM accumulation in\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 04 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

The\nuptake of N and K could be further increased by applying\nappropriate K application, with a more obvious effect observed at\nhigh N level (Figures 3, 4). Co-application of N and K had extremely\nsignificant interactive effects on the uptake of N and K in the\naboveground organs of rice (Supplementary Table S2). The highest\nuptakes of N and K in stem-sheath, leaf and panicle were observed\nunder N3 at both full heading stage and maturity stage.\nAt maturity stage, the maximum increases were obtained under\nN3K1 (48.20%) in 2019 and N3K2 (91.29%) in 2020 for the total\n\nuptake of N, and under N3K2 (176.30%) in 2019 and N3K1\n(88.21%) in 2020 for the total uptake of K, respectively, when\ncompared with other treatments.\n\n\n3.3 Use efficiency of N and K\n\n\nNo obvious and consistent changes were observed in the\nresponse of N and K use efficiency indexes to the combined\n\n\n\napplication of N and K in two years test results. NRE decreased\nbut KHI increased with increasing N levels. Although the\napplication of K could increase NRE, NAE, NCR and KCR within\na certain range, it resulted in a decrease KAE (Tables 2, 3). Variance\nanalysis showed that co-application of N and K had extremely\nsignificant interactive effects only on recovery efficiency and harvest\n\nindex of N and K.\n\nCompared with other treatments, the maximum increases were\nobtained under N1K3 (193.30-236.86%) in both years for NRE, and\nunder N1K3 (442.90%) in 2019 and N3K1 (1664.63%) in 2020 for\n\nKRE. And the maximum increases were obtained under N3K1\n\n(19.44%) in 2019 and N3K3 (31.47%) in 2020 for NHI, and under\n\nN3K0 (171.06%) in 2019 and N3K1 (121.91%) in 2020 for KHI.\n\n\n3.4 Expression of N and K metabolismrelated genes\n\n\nSix genes were selected for analysis in response to the different\nfertilizer application rates in hybrid rice cultivar YXY 2115,\nconsidering their significant roles in N and K metabolism. The\n\nresults showed that OsNRT1.1B, OsNR2, OsHAK1, OsHAK5 and\n\nOsAKT1 had high expression level under high application rates of\nboth N and K except OsAMT2;1, which were consistent with the\nabove results of N and K uptake (Figure 5). The peak expression\n\nlevels of OsNRT1.1B and OsAMT2;1 were obtained under N3K1\n\n\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nEffects of combined application of N and K on dry matter accumulation of YXY 2115 at full heading stage (above) and maturity stage (below).

Meanwhile, OsHAK1 and OsAKT1\nachieved the highest expression levels under N3K3.\n\n\n3.5 Yield and yield components\n\n\nWith increasing N levels, grain yield (GY), panicle number\n(PN) and spikelet per panicle (SP) increased, while seed setting rate\n(SR) showed the opposite trend. No significant difference was found\nin 1000-grain weight (GW) among different treatments. The\ncombination of appropriate N levels with a high K level could\nfurther improve yield and yield components (Table 4). Variance\nanalysis showed that co-application of N and K had extremely\nsignificant interactive effects on SP. The highest GY, PN and SP\nwere observed under N3. Compared with other treatments, the\n\nmaximum increases of GY and SR were obtained under N2K2\n\n(3.27-5.61%) and N1K3 (16.32-20.53%), respectively. And the\nmaximum increases were obtained under N2K3 (117.97%) in\n\n2019 and N3K3 (39.06%) in 2020 for PN, and under N3K2\n\n(29.10%) in 2019 and N2K3 (30.78%) in 2020 for SP.\n\nRegression analysis of N and K application rates and yield was\ncarried out. By establishing a binary quadratic equation, the\nfertilizer response function equation between N and K application\n\n\n\nrates and yield was obtained.\n\n\nY 2019 = \u22120:0179N [2] +7:4833N\u22120:0112K [2] +3:0036K+0:0003NK+5944:5694\n\n\nY 2020 = \u22120:0159N [2] +7:3209N\u22120:0062K [2] +2:8293K\u22120:0067NK+5833:8396\n\n\nHere: Y represents the yield (kg ha [-1] ), N represents the nitrogen\napplication rate (kg ha [-1] ), K represents the potassium application\nrate (kg ha [-1] ).\nThe results showed that the relationship between N and K\napplication rates and yield could be described by binary quadratic\nequations, with each index exhibiting a maximum value (Figure 6).\nConsidering both economic benefits and yield, in conjunction with\nthe fertilizer response function equation, the optimal yield reached\n6936.58 kg ha [-1] in 2019. The recommended application rates for N\nand K were 210.18 kg ha [-1] and 136.90 kg ha [-1], respectively. In 2020,\nthe highest yield achieved was 6750.54 kg ha [-1] in 2020, with the\nsuggested application rates of N and K being 205.98 kg ha [-1] and\n115.02 kg ha [-1], respectively.\n\n\n3.6 Rice quality\n\n\nThe application of N could improve rice appearance quality, but\ndecreased milling quality, as well as cooking and eating quality.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nEffects of combined application of N and K on N uptake of YXY 2115 at full heading stage (above) and maturity stage (below).

Studies have reported that the\n\n\n\naccumulation of DM increased with increasing N levels (Sun,\n2019), and the N accumulation of rice all increased at each\n\ngrowth stage (Tang et al., 2019). The combined application of N\nand K could significantly alleviate the limitations to photosynthesis,\nespecially the biological constraints (Hou et al., 2018). In the present\nstudy, the DM accumulation of each vegetative organ in the\naboveground part of YXY 2115 increased with increasing N levels\nat both full heading stage and maturity stage. Notably, the uptakes\nof N and K in stem-sheaths and leaves decreased, while showing a\nsignificantly increase in panicles, in agreement with the previous\nstudies (Li et al., 2014; Yan, 2018; Jiang et al., 2020). Compared with\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 09 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al.

N1, N2 and\nN3 refer to the different nitrogen fertilizer treatments (135, 180 and 225 kg ha [-1], respectively). K0, K1, K2 and K3 refer to the different potassium\nfertilizer treatments (0, 90, 135 and 180 kg ha [-1], respectively). Different lowercase letters mean the significant difference between treatments levels at\np < 0.05. The data presented are the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, n = 3.\n\n\n\nN1, the total DM accumulation at maturity stage increased by\n14.79-18.64%%. As more N was gradually applied, the uptakes of N\nand K in stem-sheaths, leaves and panicles all increased. Compared\nwith N1, the total uptake of N and K under N3 at maturity stage\nincreased by 5.89-24.94%% and 17.68-40.99%, respectively. The\nenhancement of N and K uptake could be further optimized\nthrough the appropriate application of K, with a more\n\n\n\npronounced effect observed under high N levels. However, the\nDM accumulation showed a trend of first increasing and then\ndecreasing with increasing K under moderate and higher N levels,\nindicating that while appropriate application of K under high N\nlevels increased DM accumulation, excessively high N and K levels\nmay hinder this process.

Hence, correlation analysis was conducted on\nindexes that were relatively important in terms of rice nutrient\nabsorption and utilization, yield, and quality, as well as those\nexhibiting significant interactive effects when N and K were\napplied together. Correlation analysis showed that GY was\nsignificantly positively correlated with TDA, TNA and TKA at\nmaturity stage (Figure 7).

K has been observed to enhance the activities of\nnitrate reductase and aminotransferases, indicating a positive role of\nK in N metabolism (Ahanger et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016). In our\nstudy, as more N was gradually applied, NRE decreased and KHI\nincreased. Simultaneously, NRE, NAE, NCR and KCR increased,\nwhile KAE decreased with increasing K at the same N level. The\nobserved changes in nutrients use efficiency and yield aligned with\nthe principle of diminishing returns for fertilizer (Lu, 2003). Most\nresearchers addressed that the application of N within a certain\nrange could lead to a decrease in NRE, which was consistent with\nour results. However, variations in other indexes in the two-year\nfield experiments were either inconsistent or not conspicuous,\nwhich differed with the results of previous studies. This might be\n\n\n\nrelated to the unique characteristics of the YXY 2115 cultivar.

However, researches on the\nexpression of genes related to N and K metabolism are mainly\n\nfocused on rice roots, shoots, stems and leaves.\nPrevious studies have identified LOC_Os10g40600 as encoding\na nitrate transporter NRT1.1B which has been demonstrated to\nmediate nitrate signal transduction. In this study, the expression\nlevel of OsNRT1.1B in rice grains increased as more N was gradually\napplied, while the impact of K application rate on OsNRT1.1B\nexpression was limited (Figure 5A). These findings provided\nevidence that NRT1.1B expression was substantially induced by\nnitrate and was directly involved in nitrate uptake and nitrate\ntransport (Hu et al., 2015). Ammonium uptake from the soil\nsolution is mediated by ammonium transporters, such as the\nOsAMT2;1 gene, which encodes a functional ammonium\ntransporter and is a key gene in ammonium ion absorption\npathway. It has been reported that the expression level of\nOsAMT2;1 in rice cultivars with different N use efficiency varied\nunder different N application rates. High N use efficiency rice\ncultivar showed higher gene expression levels in leaves under low\nN application levels (Yang, 2021). However, no obviously changes\nwere observed in OsAMT2;1 expression level in rice grains under\ndifferent N and K application rates, except for N3K0, which requires\nfurther study (Figure 5B). Nitrate reductase (NR) is an important\nenzyme in plant N metabolism, playing a key role in N absorption\nand utilization. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two members of NR\ngene family in rice genome, NR1 and NR2, with over 70% similarity\nbetween their protein sequences (Zhao, 2010). During the grain\nfilling process, NR activity in leaves first increased and then\ndecreased. The activity of NR increased with increasing N levels\n\n\n\n(Lan, 2022). Consistent with this trend, the present study found that\nthe expression level of OsNR2 in rice grains increased with\nincreasing N levels, and could be further enhanced by applying\nappropriate K application at high N levels (Figure 5C).\nK plays irreplaceable roles in plant growth and development.\nThe KUP/HAK/KT family, with the largest family members and\ndiverse functions, is involved in nutrient metabolism, growth\nregulation and stress tolerance (Chai et al., 2019). Studies suggest\nthat OsHAK1, OsHAK5, and OsAKT1 are crucial for K [+] uptake at\nboth low and high concentrations, as well as for K [+] translocation\nfrom root to shoot. OsHAK1 and OsAKT1 exhibit high expression\nlevels in all cell types of roots and low levels in shoots (Manuel et al.,\n2016). Additionally, the transcription levels of HAK genes are\nregulated by the level of K nutrition. Overexpressing HAK1 or\nHAK5 in rice and maize increased K [+] uptake, thereby increasing\ngrain yield (Qin et al., 2019). In our studies, higher expression levels\nof OsHAK1, OsHAK5, and OsAKT1 in rice grains were observed\n\nunder N3K2 or N3K3, which were consistent with the above results\n\nof K uptake, indicating that a high N application level combined\nwith a high K application level was beneficial to K absorption in rice\n(Figures 5D\u2013F).\n\n\n4.3 Effects of co-application N and K on\nrice yield and quality\n\n\nDifferent N application patterns need to be combined with\nappropriate application of K to achieve optimal yields. Excessive\napplication of either N or K not only results in fertilizer waste and\nenvironment pollution but also decrease fertilizer use efficiency\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 13 [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org)\n\n\nChen et al. [10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2024.1335744)\n\n\n\n(Wang et al., 2010b). Our results were corroborated with previous\nstudies indicating that rice yield exhibited an incremental trend\nwith increasing N application. However, beyond a certain threshold\nof N application, the yield increase became statistically insignificant\n(Hu et al., 2012). Over a two-year field experiment, our results\ndemonstrated that co-application of N and K yielded a higher rice\noutput compared to sole application of either N or K. These results\nindicated that appropriate combined application of N (180 kg ha [-1] )\nand K (135 kg ha [-1] ) could not only improve GY but also reduced the\nfertilizer input. However, an increase in K application did not\nexhibit a pronounced effect on the improvement of yield at the\nsame N level. Correlation analysis showed that GY was significantly\npositively correlated with PN and SP (Figure 7), indicating that the\nincrease of PN and SP might be the primary factors contributing to\nthe increased GY from N and K application (Yang and Zhang,\n2011). Furthermore, the positive impact of K application on rice\nyield components might be attributed to its promotion of root\ndevelopment, subsequently enhancing nutrient uptake by plants.\nDespite N application leading to a decrease in seed setting rate (SR),\nK application had a counteractive effect, compensating for the\noverall grain yield formation. The decrease in SR might be\n\nattributed to the substantial enhancement of PN and SP induced\n\nby N application, expanding the capacity of \u201csink\u201d rapidly.\nNevertheless, the grain filling process could not be carried out or\ncomplete timely due to the limited supply of \u201csource\u201d, which in turn\nled to the decrease in SR (Sun et al., 2012).\n\nIt is widely reported that reasonable application of N can reduce\nCR and CD of rice, thus improving the appearance quality of rice\n(Zhang, 2017). And the appropriate application of K under\nconditions that meet the N requirements for rice growth can\neffectively increase HR and reduce CR and CD, thereby\nenhancing both the milling quality and appearance quality of rice\n(Zhang et al., 2018). Besides, the contribution rate affecting rice\nquality tended to be in the order of N > K > P, with the interactive\neffect of N and K surpassing that of N and P (Xie et al., 2014). In the\npresent study, milling quality of YXY 2115 decreased with\nincreasing N levels. As more K was gradually applied at the same\nN level, both MR and HR first increased and then decreased. The\nabove results indicated that N and K mutually promoted each other,\nand their combined application was beneficial for improving the\nmilling quality of rice. The appearance quality of YXY 2115\nincreased with increasing N levels. However, as more K was\ngradually applied at the same N level, obvious increases in CR\n\nand CD were found. This result was not consistent with the\n\nprevious studies (Wang, 2015). The possible reason for this\ndifference could be the relatively high content of available K in\nthe experimental field soil, causing a decrease in the appearance\nquality of rice when additional K was applied. In general, higher\nfertilizer application tends to result in increased rice yield, but may\nreduce rice eating quality. Parts of rice quality indexes can be\nsignificantly enhanced within a certain level of K application (Ye,\n2021). Co-application of N and K can increase protein content of\nrice, thereby improve rice nutritional quality. However, the lack of\nK will lead to a decline in both the eating quality and nutritional\nvalue of rice (Zhang, 2017). In our study, the cooking and eating\nquality of YXY 2115 decreased with increasing N levels. As more K\n\n\n\nwas gradually applied at the same N level, the taste value,\nappearance and mouthfeel all first increased and then decreased,\nin agreement with the previous studies (Zhang and Qian, 2017). It is\nwidely recognized that rice cultivars with high eating quality\nnormally show higher peak viscosity and breakdown viscosity,\ncoupled with lower setback viscosity, as determined by the RVA.\nVariance analysis showed that co-application of N and K had\nsignificant interactive effects on PV, BV and SV. However, no\nsignificant differences or prominent impacts were found in the\nresponse of RVA profile characters to co-application of N and K\nover a two-year field experiment, indicating that the combined\napplication of N and K had limited effects on rice starch viscosity\n(Zhang, 2017). Taken together, in order to improve the appearance,\nmilling, and cooking and eating quality of rice, a reasonable\nnitrogen-potassium ratio becomes particularly important. The\noptimal milling, cooking and eating quality were obtained under\nN1K2, while the best appearance quality was obtained under N3K0.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\n\nReasonable combined application of N and K can mitigate\nfertilizer waste, reduce environmental pollution, lower production\ncosts and increase economic benefits by improving fertilizer use\nefficiency, rice yield and quality, thereby achieving the sustainable\ndevelopment of agriculture. The present study investigated the\neffects of co-application of N and K on rice yield, quality and\nnutrients absorption and utilization through a two-year field\nexperiment. The results revealed the feasibility of enhancing rice\nproduction efficiency and yield through co-application of N and K,\nwhich might provide an important reference for the large-scale\npromotion and application of Yixiangyou 2115. The highest rice\nyield was obtained under N2K2, while the optimal rice quality was\nobtained under N1K2. Thus, we recommended appropriate N\napplication levels ranging from 206 kg ha [-1] to 210 kg ha [-1],\ncombined with K application levels ranging from 115 kg ha [-1] to\n137 kg ha [-1] as a preferable approach to achieve high yield for super\nhybrid indica rice cultivar Yixiangyou 2115 in southwest China. A\ncombination of 135 kg ha [-1] N and 135 kg ha [-1] K application rates\nwas recommended for achieving better quality in rice production.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\nin the article/Supplementary Material.

Sulphur\nfrom autumn applications may be lost via overwinter leaching. The quantity leached will\n\ndepend on soil type and overwinter rainfall and is likely to be higher on light textured soils\n\nin high rainfall areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### **The importance of laboratory analysis and sampling**\n\nThe nutrient content of organic manures on farms vary widely and so it is better to have\na laboratory analysis carried out to get the correct values specifically for the farm and\nthe year in question. However, it is important that the sample taken for analysis is truly\n\nrepresentative. This means that sampling should be undertaken according to the protocol\n\ngiven in the AHDB Nutrient Management Guide (RB209), Section 2 Organic Manures.\n\n\nIn the absence of a recent analysis, and where thorough sampling can not be done, these\n\ntypical values represent an alternative for nutrient planning purposes.\n\n\n**FOR MORE INFORMATION AND CONTACT DETAILS SEE THE PDA WEBSITE**\n\n\n**www.pda.org.uk**\n\n\n**The Potash Development Association**\nis an independent technical organisation formed\nto support the efficient use of potash fertiliser\nin the UK.\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n",

It is a structural part of most of the soil minerals and its availability to\nplants is not directly proportional to the total amount of K in the soils. Potassium\navailability can be understood only by understanding the K content in soil, forms\nof K, soil mineralogy, and weathering status of the soils.\n\n\n2.1 Potassium Content in Soil\n\n\nCurrently, the world\u2019s most important potash deposits are located in (1) the Elk\nPoint, Maritimes, Paradox, and Salado Basins in North America; (2) the Zechstein,\nPripyat, Solikamsk, and Pricaspian Basins in Europe; (3) the Danakil and Lower\nCongo Basins in Africa; (4) the Dead Sea, Khorat, Sakon Nakon, Qaidam, and\nCentral Asia Basins in Asia; and (5) the Amazonas, Sergipe, and Neuqu\u00e9n Basins in\nSouth America (Fig. 2.1). Major potash producer countries are Canada, followed by\nRussian Federation, Belarus, Germany, Israel, Jordan, China, USA, Brazil, Chile,\nSpain, and UK (Jasinski 2011). In cultivated areas, K concentration may vary from\n0.01% to 4%, with an average calculated value of 1.36% (Jakovljevi\u0107 et al. 2003). In\nmineral soils, the average concentration of K is ~1.4%, with a broad range of 0.01%\nto 3.7%. The total soil K contents frequently exceed 20,000 mg kg [\ufffd][1] in most soils\n(Rehm and Schmitt 2002). In rocks and several soils, K is a major constituent of the\nprimary rock-forming minerals, for instance, alkali feldspar group, namely microcline and orthoclase. Mica group, specifically biotite and muscovite and secondary\nminerals such as illite are also a rich source of K (Jakovljevi\u0107 et al. 2003).\nThe concentration of soil available K varies with the degree of weathering and the\nsoil parent material which has direct impact on its supply (Table 2.1). In soils, K\nexists in four major forms, namely structural K, exchangeable (readily available),\nnon-exchangeable or fixed (slowly available), and readily available solution K\n\n\n\n# The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte\nLtd. 2022\n\nA.

In Sumner ME (ed), Handbook of soil\nscience. CRC Press, London, p B3\u2013B24\n\n\n\n(Rehm and Schmitt 2002). It has been revealed that more than 90% of soil K is\npresent in the form of primary minerals, while the amount of plant available K in the\nsoil solution is only about 0.2%, and it is the principle source of K for plant uptake\n(Fig. 2.3). The fixed form of K is called as structural, mineral, native, matrix or inert\nK. In many soils, the total K or the bulk of it is structural K is not directly available to\nplants. It has been found that nearby 90\u201398% K in the soil is in the unavailable form\ndepending on soil type. This K is released through the weathering process, nevertheless this process is so slow that it cannot meet crop requirements. However, fixed K\ncontents influence the concentration of soluble K in soil solution (Jakovljevi\u0107 et al.\n2003).\nThe second type of K present in the soil is the exchangeable K; which is present at\nthe exchange sites of various soil colloid complexes. This K is held by different bond\nstrengths at the non-specific adsorption sites. These sites may include the planer and\nedge positions of soil clay minerals or the negative charge sites which are developed\nby carboxylic and phenolic groups of humus colloids. The amount of K held at\nexchangeable sites of soil clay minerals depends upon the kinetic and thermodynamic factors (Parfitt 1992), for instance, the K concentration at exchangeable site in\nrelation to other exchangeable cation, and the nature of the soil surface. Approximately 90% of available K is present in exchangeable K, whereas the proportion of\nexchangeable to total K is <2%. It is stated that exchangeable K has a strong link\nwith CEC, pH, calcium carbonate, and organic carbon (Baruah et al. 1991). For\nexample, aridisols and inceptisols have comparatively higher K rich mica\n(Srinivasarao et al. 2007), and K present in illite have less mobility as these minerals\nhave narrow interlayer space which are K selective and ultimately decrease its\ndesorption (Sparks and Huang 1985; Sparks 1987). Furthermore, sub-surface soils\nhave less exchangeable K than surface soils and higher concentration of exchangeable K in the soil represent a good indication of ability of soil to supply K. Some\nexchangeable K may fix between layers of clay minerals and may be converted into\nslowly available K (Rehm and Schmitt 2002).\nThe third form of K is the non-exchangeable, fixed or slowly available, which is\ntrapped between the clay mineral layers, and plants cannot use this K fraction during\na single season. Nevertheless, this K can act as a reservoir for exchangeable K that is\nreadily available (Rehm and Schmitt 2002). This form of K is held between the\nadjacent tetrahedral layers of di- and tri-octahedral vermiculites and micas or\nbetween the chloritized vermiculite (Sparks and Huang 1985; Sparks 1987). The\nfixation of K takes place due to the increase in the number of binding forces between\n\n\n10 2 Potassium Dynamics in Soils\n\n\nK and clay surfaces than the hydration forces which are present between the\nindividual ions of K (Sparks 1987), making the release of K easy due to physical\ntrapping. The conversion of non-exchangeable K into the exchangeable K occurs\nwhen the solution K and exchangeable K level are decreased due to K removal by\ncrops, losses through leaching or through enhanced activates of soil microbes\n(Sparks 2000).\nThe non-exchangeable K is moderately to sparingly available to plants. The\nhigher concentration of non-exchangeable K is noticed in sub-surface soils than\nsurface soil. Furthermore, the soils enriched with illit clay minerals have high nonexchangeable K in the sub-surface because of the presence of clay and silt which\nhave ability to fix K (Sharma et al. 2009). This K fixation depends on the amount of\nK released from clay minerals, particle size, and their distribution/quantity and type\nof clay minerals, because these properties have strong correlation with clay and silt\nproportion of soil. The quantity of K fixed in soil and type of clay minerals rich in K\ncan influence the release of K to plants (Rao et al. 2001).\nThe fourth form of K is in the solution form which is readily available to plant.\nReadily available K may also be present at the exchangeable site of clay minerals\nwhich has been discussed earlier. The quantity of K in soil solution depends upon\nabsorption through the plants and also involves the soil minerals from which K is\nreleased. When the plants dissolve K present in soil solution, the concentration of K\nin soil solution drops, which is balanced after the release of K from exchangeable\nsites of clay minerals. This form of K mostly faces a leaching problem in soil. In the\nsoil solution, the amount of K is not constant and ranges from 3 to 30 mg kg [\ufffd][1] for\nnormal soils (Haby et al. 1990). The solution K level is mediated by kinetic\nreactions, soil moisture contents, and the equilibrium that occur between the forms\nof soil K, the concentrations of divalent cations in solution and on the exchanger\nphase (Sparks 2000). The amount of soil solution K is also affected by the buffering\ncapacity of soil clay minerals. For example, well-buffered vermiculates and micas\ncan hold the solution K level very firmly, while that of buffered allophonic clay\nmineral do not maintain the soil solution K level (Parfitt 1992). Additionally, slowly\navailable K, exchangeable K, and water-soluble K are interconvertible (Fig. 2.3),\nand this conversion is mediated by various factors, for instance, K supply, soil\nmoisture, soil temperature, and the removal of K via plant roots.\nThe removal of K by the plant is facilitated by K concentration in soil solution, K\navailability index, organic matter, clay minerology, cation exchange capacity, calcium carbonate, and other properties. The knowledge regarding the variation in K\nadsorption, differences among various soil types and the equilibration between K\nintensity and the phases of the quantity is valuable for precise and site-specific\npotash recommendation. Furthermore, the K contents in the soil may increase and\ndecrease depending on environmental and soil conditions. The indigenous soil K\ncontents are depleting with time owing to intensive cultivation of crops with less\npotash fertilization and other crop management practices, particularly the removal of\ncrop residues from the field.\n\n\n2.2 Soil Mineralogy and Potassium Dynamics 11\n\n\n2.2 Soil Mineralogy and Potassium Dynamics\n\n\nSoil clay mineralogy has great consequence in soil nutrient supplying capacity and\noverall nutritional status of a particular soil. It is exposed that the mineralogical\ncomposition of the soil may largely impact the K dynamics within the soil\n(Surapaneni et al. 2002), and this relationship between the K forms and clay\nmineralogy can be used to predict soil K fertility, and ultimately the potash fertilizer\nrecommendation. Clay mineralogy in the soil influences the fixed K which is not\nreadily available fraction of K in the soil. For instance, when the soil becomes dry,\nmontmorillonite clays fix K because K is trapped in clay mineral layers. When the\nsoil becomes wet, this trapped K release. In contrast, illite dominant soils, the K is\nfixed between the layers of clay minerals when the soil is dry, but releases only small\namount of K when soil becomes wet. Furthermore, clay minerals such as smectite\nand kaolinite easily release all of their adsorbed K than do illite and vermiculite\n(Mengel and Uhlenbecker 1993). Therefore, the age of soil developed from these\nclay minerals determines the extent of weathering are responsible to regulate the soil\nK dynamics (Fig. 2.2).\nThe major share of K exists in micas and feldspars clay minerals which contain\n6\u20139% and 3.5\u201312% of the total soil K and such 2:1 type of clay mineral revealed as\nmajor sources of non-exchangeable K (Moritsuka et al. 2004). However, the plants\nare unable to use this crystalline-insoluble K present in these minerals. Weathering\nof these rocks result in the release of K; some of this K moves towards the readily\navailable pool and some towards slowly available pool. Thus, this K fixation in illite\nclays without release causes serious problems for management of potash fertilizer for\ncrop production (Rehm and Schmitt 2002). The other clay minerals which bear K are\nprimary aluminosilicates such as micas-muscovite, biotite and secondary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10% K (fixed) 6-8% K 4-6% K approx. 3% K <1% K\n\n\nCEC (0 meq/100g soil) CEC (30-50 meq/100g soil) CEC (140-160 meq/100g soil)\n\n\nAs a result of weathering process soil hydration, specific surface area, and CEC are increasing\nwith reducing particle size, meanwhile indigenous soil K contents are decreasing\n\n\nFig. 2.2 Schematic diagram of the soil weathering process in relation to potash availability.

The formation of these phyllosilicates\noccurs through the weathering of primary minerals or from the secondary silicates\nafter adequate rainfall (Essington 2004). The K availability to plants is very easy\nfrom phyllosilicates and its associated clay minerals. A majority of clay particles in\nsoil have particle size of <0.002 mm, and are made from the secondary clay\nminerals.\nThe exchangeable K may bind on non-specific adsorption sites of clay minerals,\nat the carboxylic and phenolic groups of soil and also on soil organic matter. The\nabsorption of the K [+] takes place non-specifically in hydrated form. These\nnon-specific adsorption sites are present on the edge \u201ce\u201d and planar \u201cp\u201d position of\nclay minerals, and aluminum hydroxides and amorphous iron (Sparks 2003). The\nlattice or structural K is covalently bonded with the crystalline structure of K\nenriched primary silicate minerals such as feldspars, namely microcline, orthoclase\nshowing framework structure and micas, namely muscovite biotite showing layered\nstructure. The micas consist of ~8% of soil K. These types of clay minerals are\npresent in the coarser fractions of soils (e.g. sand and silt) and the contained K in\nthese minerals is release through the long-term weathering process. However, this K\nis not practically available to plants. The typical process of weathering proceeds in\nfollowing order: (1) muscovite, (2) hydro muscovite, (3) illite, (4) mixed clay\nminerals, e.g. kaolinite-illit or illit-montmorillonite (Fig. 2.2). In this weathering\nprocess, the K ion is substituted by hydroksyanion H 3 O [+], and thus the next product\ncontains less K (Pracz 2003).\nAlthough K is found in large quantities in world soil, the immediate plant\navailable K is non-sufficient to meet the requirement of a specific crop. Beside\nthis, the added K fertilizer may adsorb on soil colloids, may fix in clay minerals, or\ncan leach to the underground water, especially in sandy soils. It has been found that\n~57% of the applied K can be adsorbed by soil colloid depending on the type and\namount of soil clay minerals (Pal et al. 1999), for example, illite and vermiculite\nhave higher K adsorption specificity. In contrast, some studies have quantified that\nthe rate of K adsorption on illite and vermiculite clay minerals is slower than that\nrecorded on kaolinite and montmorillonite. The particle size and chemical composition of the clay minerals affects considerably the release of K from clay minerals\n(Huang 2005) (Table 2.2). Furthermore, the fixation process of K is relatively fast,\nwhereas the release of fixed K is very slow due to the strong binding force between K\n\n\n2.3 Nature of Minerals in Pakistani Soils 13\n\n\nand clay minerals (\u00d6born et al. 2005). Whether a soil fixes or releases K highly\ndepends on the K concentration in the soil solution (Schneider et al. 2013).\n\n\n2.3 Nature of Minerals in Pakistani Soils\n\n\nThe soils of Pakistan are composed of the various types of clay minerals such as\nmuscovite, biotite, mica, smectite and vermiculite, feldspar, quarts, chlorite, montmorillonite, kaolinite, and illite. Among these clay minerals, both mica and illite are\ndominent in the soils of Pakistan, and it determines the chemistry of soil solution,\nand thus the fertilizer behavior (Fig. 2.3). The silt and sand fractions of these soils\nconsist of primary clay minerals such as mica, feldspar, and quarts; mica and\nfeldspar present in large fractions and are ores of K. The clay fractions consist of\nsecondary clay minerals, namely vermiculite, chlorite, montmorillonite, kaolinite,\nillite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite being most abundant. Although the soils of\nPakistan also have chlorite and kaolinite clay minerals which contain K, but their\nsignificance as potash nutrition is low due to their low nutrient retention ability.\nIndeed, the poor drainage and semi-arid environmental conditions may cause the\nfurther weathering of these both clay minerals to saponitic smectites.\nThe alluvial soils of Pakistan have both clay minerals, namely mica and illite;\ncrucial source of K nutrient. Mica is most dominate K bearing clay mineral in\nPakistan which is formed by slow weathering of Himalayan rocks. The K contents\nof mica in clay, silt, and sand are 97%, 93%, and 70%, respectively (Ali et al. 2006).\nDuring weathering, mica releases the K ions into soil solution. If the process of\nweathering proceeds enough, mica is converted into expandable illite, also known as\nhydrated mica, after the entry of water in interlayer. The hydrous mica in Pakistani\nsoils is of two types namely biotite mica and muscovite. Among both these types, the\nbiotite mica is more important form fertility point of view as it releases the K,\n100 times more than muscovite in soil solution (Ali et al. 2006).\nLike other clay minerals, smectite and vermiculite are found in very low quantity\nin most of the soils in Pakistan, but these clay minerals play a crucial role in the\nfixation and release of K fertilizers due to their shrinking and swelling properties and\nhigher nutrient exchange capacity. The formation of vermiculite clay minerals takes\nplace after intensive weathering of illite, accomplished with the release of K. In soils,\nwhere the vermiculite is a dominant clay mineral, the phenomenon of fixation may\noccur due to high nutrient exchange capacity and high adsorption selectivity of\nvermiculites for ammonium and K than other nutrients, which may reduce the\nfertilizer use efficiency. However, the vermiculite clay minerals are rarely developed\nin the Pakistani soil except in Murree, Wazirabad, Gujranwala, and Satgarh soil\nseries (Ali et al. 2006).\nIn Pakistani soils, the smectite clay mineral can be divided into beidellite and\nmontmorillonite. Under wet conditions, both of these clay minerals expand, while\nboth shrink on drying. Regarding the K fixation, the behavior of beidellite clay\nmineral is similar to vermiculite, while the K fixation capacity of montmorillonite is\n50 times less than beidellite. Thus, in Pakistani soils, the occurrence of beidellite and\n\n\n14 2 Potassium Dynamics in Soils\n\n\n2.4 Plant Available Potassium 15\n\n\nvermiculite is highly related to K deficiency, while the occurrence of illite and\nmontmorillonite to optimum K supply status. A soil can be regarded as best which\ncontain montmorillonite and both illite/mica, because the K released from both these\nclay minerals can be held as an exchangeable nutrient by montmorillonite clay\nmineral with less fixation but more easy availability to crop roots (Ali et al. 2006).\n\n\n2.4 Plant Available Potassium\n\n\nThe amount of K present in the soil is evaluated by a number of soil factors such as\nits uptake by plant, degree of weathering such as the amount and type of clay, the\naddition of fertilizer, leaching losses, and the fixation process/K release that occur in\nthe soil. As mentioned earlier, the plants are unable to take up most of the soil\nindigenous K because it is present in structural or fixed form. Plants can take up only\nthose fractions of the K which are present in the dissolved form (<100 mg kg [\ufffd][1] ) or\nexchangeable form (Rehm and Schmitt 2002). Furthermore, the supply of K to plant\nis directly controlled by the K concentration in soil solution. Additionally, some soils\nwith low plant available K can maintain the high levels of solution K which fulfill the\ncrop requirements and hence the outer K input did not impact crop growth as the\nneeds are fulfilled by K already in soil.\nIn Pakistan, K content in soils has traditionally been considered adequate for\nnormal plant growth as they are developed from mica type of clay minerals; but in\nmost soils, most of this K is not necessarily available to plants to complete their life\ncycle. In such soils, K is bound to the clay mineral which do not release the K at the\nrates which are required for optimum crop harvest. In an early study, it was reported\nthat most of soils in Pakistan have less than 150 mg kg [\ufffd][1] of exchangeable K (Bajwa\nand Rehman 1996), and it is considered deficient to fulfill the requirements of most\nof the crops. Furthermore, the extensive cropping with high yielding cultivars\naccomplished with no potash fertilizer in Pakistani soils have seriously dropped\nsoil indigenous K level. More than 30% of soils in Pakistan require potash fertilizer\nbecause these soils are K deficient (Akhtar and Dixon 2009). However, the application rate is also very low and according to the most recent report only 16% farmers in\ncotton growing areas of Pakistan use potash containing fertilizers while 44% soils\nare revealed K deficient (Wakeel and Ishfaq 2016).\nIn intention to assess the changing pattern of soil K levels in Pakistan, data from\nsoil samples analyzed for advisory purpose to farmers from two particular years,\nnamely 1990 and 2005 were compared (Table 2.3). The Punjab province of Pakistan\nwas categorized into four agroecological zones, namely Rainfed Zone comprises of\nnorthern parts of the province; Rice Zone consists of irrigated north-eastern parts of\nthe province; Central Zone comprises of central irrigated districts of the province and\ncotton Zone falls in southern parts of the province. It was observed that within\n\n\u2013\n15 years; soil available K declined 7 49% in different agroecological zones of\nPunjab province. Such dramatic depletion of K is alarming, and soils are prone to\nadditional K deficiency if potash fertilizers will not be oriented in farmer input\npractices.\n\n\n16 2 Potassium Dynamics in Soils\n\n\nTable 2.3 Soil potassium level (mg kg [\ufffd][1] ) in various crop zones of Punjab\u2013Pakistan by 1990 to\n2005 (analyzed by Soil Fertility Research Institute, Punjab)\n\n|Zone|1990|Col3|2005|Col5|Percent decrease|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Zone|No. of samples|Mean value|No. of samples|Mean value|Mean value|\n|Rainfed|1500|114|1550|106|7|\n|Rice|1400|176|1645|132|33|\n|Central|2670|295|3200|198|49|\n|Cotton|1658|210|2280|165|27|\n\n\n\nSource: Ahmad and Mian (2009)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAhmad Z, Mian SM (2009) Increasing crop productivity through judicious use of potash in\nPakistan.

      "full_text": "## leaflet 8 **The Potash Development Association**\n\n# **Principles of Potash use**\n\n\n## **Needs of the plant**\n\nNormal plant growth requires large quantities of potassium (K, often referred to as potash, K 2 O). In fact,\nthroughout growth most crops contain more potassium than any other nutrient including nitrogen (N).\nSmall quantities of potassium are needed to support many of the crucial enzyme processes within the\nplant but very much larger amounts are used to control the water relationships in the plant. Potassium\nalso plays a vital role in the transport of sugars and other products of photosynthesis from leaves to\nstorage organs. Adequate quantities of potassium are thus essential for a crop to achieve its full yield\npotential and also for many aspects of product quality such as grain size and appearance, tuber size,\noil content, dry matter and starch content, percentage sugar and fruit ripening and quality.\n\n\nMany of the functions of potash in the plant are related to physiological conditions and stress. These\nfunctions are diverse and include efficient nitrogen and water use, drought tolerance, frost resistance and\nresistance to pests and diseases. It is therefore not surprising that lack of plant-available potash in the\nsoil results in weaker, less vigorous crops that suffer major penalties in difficult growing seasons. In years\nwhen growing conditions and yields are good the response to potash may be modest, especially for crops\nlike cereals, but in adverse years its contribution to optimum yields will be substantial. Adequate\npotassium thus provides some 'insurance' against adverse conditions in difficult growing seasons.\n\n## **'Potash' and 'potassium'**\n\n\nFertilisers and organic manures release potassium into soil solution as the potassium ion, K [+ ] and plants\ntake up potassium in this same form. However the potassium content of fertilisers is usually referred to\nand measured as 'potash' or K 2 O. This is just a convention and 'potassium', 'potash', 'K' and 'K 2 O' are\noften used interchangeably when referring to fertilisers or application rates. Soil analysis results are given\nas mg/litre (or ppm) of K (potassium) which relates to an Index, not to an amount of fertiliser, and should\nnot be confused. If it is necessary to convert K 2 O to K (for example if converting the UK recommendations\nin this leaflet for use in the Irish Republic) the K 2 O value should be multiplied by 0.83. Similarly K\nvalues can be converted to K 2 O by dividing by 0.83.\n\n\n## **The N and K partnership**\n\nPotassium and nitrogen are strongly associated in\nplant processes and should be considered together.\n\n\n\nFig 1: **K effect on N response**\n\n\n\nFirstly in terms of uptake, both nutrients are needed\nin large amounts at the same time. N is mainly taken\nup as the negatively charged nitrate anion NO 3 [- ] and\npotassium as the positively charged cation K [+] . When\nequal amounts of both are taken up together, the\nneutrality of the system is maintained. Nitrogen\napplication and uptake stimulates the growth of\nplant cells which take in water. Potassium is required\nto maintain the turgor (rigidity) and regulate the\nwater content of the cell. Maintenance of cell turgor\nis essential to optimise the interception of solar\nradiation (sunlight) to provide energy for the conversion of carbon dioxide to sugars, the basic building\nblock for the production of harvestable yield.\n\n\n2\n\n\nWithin the plant the complex formation of protein from nitrate and its distribution around the plant are\nhighly dependent upon adequate K supply. If 'normal optimum' rates of N are applied in the absence of\nsufficient K, full response to nitrogen will not be obtained and residues of nitrogen may remain and be\nleached at the end of the season (see Figure 1).\n\n\nTypical patterns of K uptake for cereals and roots are shown in Figures 2 and 3. For combinable crops,\nuptake will peak at around flowering, whereas for root crops maximum uptake is shortly before harvest\nor at haulm destruction.\n\n\nIn most plant species the total content of potassium is larger than that of any other nutrient, even\nnitrogen. For optimum growth the plant-available supply of potassium in the soil must meet both the\nmaximum total demand and the required rate of daily uptake. This will vary from season to season\ndepending on soil conditions and weather. Whenever there is a rapid surge in growth the soil supply must\nbe able to meet the demand of the crop. Hence the need to maintain soil reserves is a sound insurance.\nTypical peak rates of uptake are 5-10 kg K 2 O/ha/day for root crops and oilseed rape.\n\n\nFig 2: **Nutrient uptake of a typical** Fig 3: **Nutrient uptake of a typical**\n**8 t/ha wheat crop** **55 t/ha potato crop**\n\n\nTable 1: **Typical total uptake of potassium by large yielding crops expressed in kg/ha K** **2** **O**\n\n\nCereals 300-350\n\nOilseed rape 350-400\n\nPotatoes 400-450\n\nSugar beet 400-450\n\nPulses 150-200\n\nForage crops 300-500\n\nGrass silage (single cut) 100-170\n\n\n3\n\n\n## **Sources of potash**\n\nFig 4: **The K cycle**\n\n\nPlant roots take-up potassium as the cation K [+] from the soil solution and it is this, plus the 'readily\navailable K', which is measured by soil analysis as being potentially available to the crop (Figure 4). Small\nquantities can be taken in from a foliar application but the amounts are usually insignificant in relation\nto overall potassium needs. (It is also a costly method.) Rainfall contributes very small amounts of\npotassium (less than 5 kg/ha/year). Fertilisers, manures and crop residues all add potassium to the soil as\nK [+] . Almost all potassium sources are soluble* and increase the concentration of K in the soil solution\n\nfor the K to be released, perhaps over 12 months.\n\n\n\nOnly small amounts of K are maintained in\nthe soil solution 5-20 kg/ha K (6-24 kg K 2 O).\nThe majority of potassium reserves in the soil\nare held by the negative charges on clay\nminerals and organic matter (Figure 5). The\npotassium may be held weakly or strongly\naccording to the position in the clay lattice.\nK [+] which is loosely held ('exchangeable K') is\nrapidly released for plant uptake, whilst\nthe more firmly bonded reserve ('nonexchangeable K') is released more slowly.\nIndividual soils have different capacities to\nhold potassium according to clay type and\ncontent and amount of soil organic matter.\nSand soils have very limited reserves of\nexchangeable K.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clay minerals themselves contain potassium as an integral part of their structure (mineral K)\nand this is released only over very long time periods by the breakdown of the minerals (weathering).\nIn UK conditions the amount of K released by weathering of the clay minerals is too small to meet the\nneeds of even average crops. The different pools of soil K shown in Figure 4 are defined in relation\nto the plant availability of the K and are not distinct. The amount of K in each pool varies with\npotash additions, crop uptake, N use, soil wetting and drying, cultivations, etc.\n\n\n_except specific clay mineral fertilisers used in organic farming - see PDA Leaflet 23_ .\n\n\n4\n\n\n## **Potash leaching**\n\nPotassium does not leach anything like as readily from soils as does nitrate and sulphate. Potash\nadditions not taken up by the crop will be held in the soil by the clay minerals or organic matter as\ndescribed above. For the great majority of soils, which have a clay content of 5% or more, where\nnormal rates of potash are applied, potassium not used by the crop will remain in the cultivated layer of\nsoil and will not move further down the profile. However, significant losses of potassium can occur when\nany source of potash (fertiliser, slurry or manure) is applied under adverse conditions i.e. when soil is\nwater-logged, frozen or very dry and deeply cracked. Most of this loss is by surface run-off and can be\navoided by following codes of good agricultural practice. Soils with less than 5% clay (the sands and\nloamy sands) have a much lower retentive capacity for potassium. Such soils, especially if shallow and\nsubjected to rainfall producing large amounts of through-drainage, have a greater risk of potassium loss.\nOn these soils, potash should be applied 'little and often' and applications timed to suit crop uptake and\namounts carefully matched to crop offtake.\n\n## **Soil analysis**\n\n\nMany decades of detailed research work have resulted in the present soil analysis system as the best\npractical approach for assessing the adequacy or deficiency of soil potassium supply (see PDA Leaflet 24).\nSoil analysis measures the K in the soil solution and exchangeable K to give a guide to the amount of\npotassium that is available to the crop. All soils contain much larger total quantities of K as shown in\nFigure 4. Slowly available reserves (non-exchangeable K) may contribute to plant supply over the course\nof a season but this release is variable and impractical to measure. For many soils the slowly available\nreserve provides only a minor annual supply but it can be more important on some very clayey soils\n(see PDA Leaflet 19).\n\n## **Soil K and crop response**\n\n\nFig 6: **Response of winter wheat & spring barley to soil K** Fig 7: **Response of potatoes & field beans to soil K**\n\n\nThe yield response curve to soil potassium supply follows the same principles as for other inputs. At very\nlow levels of available soil K, the response to applied potash is large and the response decreases to nil as\nsoil supply increases. Target levels for soil K which represent the level at which K supply is adequate for\nfull yield but not excessive have been established from large numbers of response experiments for\ndifferent crops.\n\n\n5\n\n\nAs shown by the scatter of points in Figures 6 and 7 for a number of field experiments, the response to\nsoil K can vary. Often variation is due to factors other than the availability of soil K. For this reason the K\nIndex system, as in RB 209, gives a range of soil K values for each Index and is intended to provide a\ngeneral guide to interpretation.\n\n\n**soil K mg/l**\n\n\n**Index 0** 0-60 Large responses likely\n**Index 1** 61-120 Smaller responses probable\n**Index 2** 121 - 240 Responses unlikely\n**Index 3** 241 - 400 Nil response from grass & most arable crops\n**Index 4** 400 - 600 Unnecessarily high levels of reserve for arable crops & grass\n\n## **Principles of manuring**\n\n\n_It is the soil that feeds the crop, while fertilisers feed the soil._\n\n\n**Critical values of soil K for different crops have been established from numerous experiments**\n**as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 at which full crop yield will be achieved. For all soils, except the**\n**lightest textured soils which cannot sustain these levels without risk of leaching, the aim is to**\n**maintain soil K above the critical level appropriate to the rotation, using fertiliser and manure**\n**to replace the potassium removed by cropping.**\n\n\nIt should be recognised, therefore, that potash is unlike most other farm inputs, which are justified on\nthe basis of direct yield response and financial return per \u00a3 spent. Correct use of potash to replace\ncrop offtake and maintain soil reserves may not result in an immediate yield response. Failure to replace\nthe potassium removed in the crop and maintain an adequate soil reserve prejudices future yields and\ncrop quality and unnecessarily jeopardises the response to all other inputs.\n\n\nPolicy for the lightest textured soils (sands and loamy sands) should be to ensure at least the replacement\nof removals but not to expect to be able to raise the inherently low levels of soil K to the same values as\nfor other soils.\n\n## **Benefits of maintaining soil fertility**\n\n\n- Fertile soils have a better distribution of nutrients throughout the soil profile, and this cannot be\nachieved immediately from fresh fertiliser applications. This results in more effective uptake,\nespecially for poorer rooting crops such as potatoes, and better yields than can be achieved from low\nsoil fertility and high fertiliser regimes.\n\n\n- Soils with adequate nutrient levels avoid the risk of damage to roots from local, high concentrations\nof salts from large fertiliser applications.\n\n\n- Satisfactory fertility removes the urgency of timeliness in application of fertilisers, which eases peak\nwork-loads, offers cash flow benefits and allows fertiliser application to be undertaken at the best\ntime without risk to soil structure or seedbeds from tractor wheelings. Crop response to nitrogen\nfertiliser depends on having appropriate amounts of other nutrients (e.g. P, K, S, and Mg) in the soil\nprofile explored by roots. Shortages of these nutrients will result in poorer responses to nitrogen and\nthe risk of leaving unused nitrogen residues in soil.\n\n\n6\n\n\n## **Target levels of soil fertility**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - _Soil target concentrations are for Olsen P. Some laboratories use other extractants._\n\n\n** _These soils cannot be maintained at higher levels of K without risking unacceptable_\n\n\n_losses. Regular use of organic manure is of considerable benefit in these situations._\n\n\nSoil K levels cannot be rapidly changed up and down to suit individual crops and the appropriate target\nlevel must be set for the most demanding crop in the rotation.\n\n## **Low fertility soils**\n\n\n\nThe rate at which reserves in a low K soil should be\nbuilt up is largely an economic decision.\nConsideration should be given to the likely loss of\ncrop yield and quality of all the crops grown in the\nrotation on a low K soil, as well as the cost of\nfertiliser. Soils vary in their capacity to retain\npotassium (buffering capacity) and require different\nquantities of potash to increase plant-available K as\nmeasured by exchangeable K.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Approximate amounts of potash needed**\n**to increase exchangeable soil K by 60 mg/l**\n**(e.g., lower Index 1 to Index 2-)**\n\n\n\nThe quantities required may seem surprisingly large Clay 800\nbut are a consequence of the fact that some of the\nadded K goes into non-exchangeable reserves that\nare not measured by soil analysis. In practice, low soil K levels should be improved over a period of years\nusing annual remedial amounts (see for example RB 209). Heavier soils are less likely to be found with\nlow K levels but will take longer to restore to a satisfactory level than lighter soils.\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n## **Fertiliser policy**\n\nFollowing the principles of manuring stated earlier, fertiliser recommendations comprise two\ncomponents:\n\n**Replacement of nutrient removed = R**\n\nCalculated from standard offtake x yield/ha - see page 9.\n\n\n**Soil fertility adjustment**\n\n\nAdditions to improve low soil K, or reductions to allow unnecessarily high levels to decline.\nThese can be made annually to each crop or periodically in larger applications depending upon\nsoil type and rotation and financial considerations.\n\n\nThese two components vary with soil K Index as shown in the table below. Fine-tuning of the soil\nfertility adjustment could be done where soil is in the upper or lower parts of Indices 1 or 3.\nFor example, at low Index 1, the fertility adjustment could be +125 kg K 2 O/ha for vegetables or\n+35 kg K 2 O/ha for arable and grassland.\n\n### **Basis of fertiliser recommendations, kg K 2 O/ha:**\n\n\n**Vegetables:**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n## **Removal of potash**\n\nUnder-estimation of K offtake is one of the commonest causes for soil K levels to fall below target and\nemphasises the need to undertake careful estimations of the amount removed. Standard figures to\ncalculate removal and therefore **replacement** needs are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n_*_ _offtake value is per tonne of grain or seed but includes nutrients in grain and straw._\n\n\n9\n\n\n## **Fine tuning**\n\nWhere more site-specific information is available it may be possible to 'fine tune' the general offtake\nguidance in this leaflet. For example in the case of sugar beet, recent studies indicate that the tare-house\nanalysis of root K content (x 1.2 to convert to K 2 O), used in conjunction with yield provides an accurate\nindication of potash offtake, see PDA Leaflet 12.\n\n\n**A number of other specific aspects may be considered.**\n\n\n**Soil structure**\n\n\nCompaction, soil pans or other adverse structural problems can inhibit root growth and thus their ability\nto take up nutrients from a large volume of soil. 'Fertility' embraces other factors as well as nutrients,\nincluding soil aeration and water availability and organic matter content. Improvement of these factors\nleads to better biological activity in the soil and more readily available nutrients. These aspects should be\na starting point not an after-thought in fertility management.\n\n\n**Soil depth**\n\n\nSoil analysis measures the available nutrients to sampling depth - normally 15 cm for arable soils and\n7.5 cm for permanent grassland - and in soil particles less than 2 mm in diameter. The amount of soil\nin this size range that can be explored by roots is important. Thus soil depth and stoniness can affect\nnutrient availability, and should be taken into account when interpreting soil analysis results and\nassessing the amount of nutrient available. Whilst nutrients are generally most concentrated in the\nplough layer, it is clear that modern high-yielding, well-rooted crops derive considerable amounts of\npotash from greater depth. It may be valuable to estimate the likely supply of K by analysing samples\ntaken at depth for soil N. However, interpreting the results may not be easy because there is little\ninformation on the amount and distribution of roots at depth.\n\n\n**pH**\n\n\nA larger proportion of applied potash tends to become non-exchangeable on neutral and calcareous soils\nthan on soils with pH around 6. Additions of fertiliser to improve low K status will have less impact on\nsuch soils and this needs to be considered when calculating fertiliser requirements for these soils.\n\n\n**High magnesium soils**\n\n\nPotassium availability may be affected on soils with very high Mg levels. It has been suggested that where\nthe concentration (mg/l) of soil Mg is more than twice that of soil K, potash availability to the crop may\nbe less than implied by the actual potassium analysis value. In such circumstances no more magnesium\nin any form should be applied to the rotation and higher applications of K may be used to overcome the\nimbalance. The application of calcium to replace the magnesium is not recommended, principally\nbecause it will also displace K.\n\n\n**Non-exchangeable K**\n\n\nThere is still no practical method to estimate the supply of slowly released K, which will vary\ngreatly between soils and between seasons. For some heavy soils it may be sufficient to provide all\nthe needs of combinable crop rotations and permit applications for root rotations to be halved.\nHowever, this does not apply to all clay soils - see PDA Leaflet 19. On lighter soils, allowance for\nnon-exchangeable K should only be made where objective information or experience is available.\n\n\n10\n\n\n## **Organic manures**\n\nInadequate allowance is still frequently made for the nutrient contribution from manures. Use standard\nfigures unless specific analysis is available for consistent materials, and deduct the total amount of potash\nin manure applied if the soil Index is 2 or more. For soils at Index is 0 or 1, K added in manures can be\nthought of as helping to increase soil reserves and normal applications of fertiliser K should be given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**(1)** Nutrients that are available to the next crop\n\n\n**(2)** Potash values will be lower if FYM is stored in the open or for long periods\n\n\n**(3)** Adjust nutrient content if % DM is higher or lower\n\n\n**Imperial Conversions**\n\n\n**Multiply kg/m** **[3]** **by 9 to give units/1000 gals**\n**Multiply kg/t by 2 to give units/ton**\n\n\n11\n\n\nA difficult financial situation should not persuade farmers to reduce levels of potash below the guidelines in this leaflet. Whilst the soil K targets are not precise cut-off points, it must be recognised that the\nrisk of yield and quality penalties generally increases with lower soil K levels. In view of the fact that\npotash is not lost from most soils and that it is the least expensive of all major nutrients, such risks do\nnot seem worthwhile.\n\n\nThe estimation of potash offtake and the replacement of this quantity remains the most important\naspect of fertiliser policy for K.\n\n## **Timing**\n\n\nIndividual recommendations for specific crops are detailed in other PDA leaflets.\n\n\n\n\n\n**24** Soil Analysis\nKey to Nutrient Management Planning\n\n\n**25** What you should know about fertilisers\n\n\n**26** Nutrient Requirements of Forage Crops\n\n\n**27** Fodder Beet - P & K offtake\n\n\n**28** Why Maintain Soil Potash Reserves?\n\n\n**29** Potash and the Environment\n\n\nPhosphate and Potash removal by crops\n\n\nNutrient Content of Manures\n\n\n\n**4** Potash manuring for Arable Crops\n\n\n**5a** Results from Cereal Demonstration Plots\n\n\n**5b** Results from Grass Demonstration Plots\n\n\n**6** Potash, Magnesium & Sodium Fertilisers for Grass\n\n\n**7** P & K Balance for Cereals\n\n\n**9** Potash for Silage (experimental results)\n\n\n**11** Cereals and Potash\n\n\n**12** Potash for Sugar Beet\n\n\n**13** Oilseed Rape and Potash\n\n\n\n**14** Potash for Grassland for Silage and Grazing\n\n\n**15** Potash for Potatoes\n\n\n**16** Fodder Beet -Fertiliser Requirements\n\n\n**17** Forage Maize - Fertiliser Requirements\n\n\n**18** Grain Legumes need Potash\n\n\n**19** Potash for Heavy Soils\n\n\n**20** Potash & Biosolids\n\n\n**22** N & K top dressing for arable crops\n\n\n**23** Potash for Organic Growers\n\n\n\n**FOR MORE INFORMATION ON POTASH CONTACT:-**\n\n\nPotash Development Association,\nPO Box 697, York YO32 5WP.\n**Tel & fax 01904 492009**\n**email: info@pda.org.uk**\n**Website: www.pda.org.uk**\n\n\n**The Potash Development Association**\nis an independent technical organisation formed\nto support the efficient use of potash fertiliser in\nthe UK\n\nOct 2006\n\n\n",

The efficiency of citric\nacid extractant was greater in illitic soils than in smectitic and kaolinitic soils.\nRelease kinetics of nonexchangeable K conformed fairly well to parabolic and firstorder kinetic models. The curve pattern of parabolic diffusion model suggested\ndiffusion controlled kinetics in all the soils, with a characteristic initial fast rate up\nto 7 h followed by a slower rate. Greater nonexchangeable K release rates in\nsmectitic soils, calculated from the first-order equation (b \u00bc 91.13 \ufffd 10 [2][4] h [2][1] ),\nsuggested that the layer edge and wedge zones and swelling nature of clay facilitated\nthe easier exchange. In contrast to smectitic soils, higher release rate constants obtained\nfrom parabolic diffusion equation (b \u00bc 39.23 \ufffd 10 [2][3] h [2][1] ) in illitic soils revealed that\nthe low amount of exchangeable K on clay surface and larger amount of interlayer K\nallowed greater diffusion gradients, thus justifying the better fit of first-order kinetic\nequation in smectitic soils and parabolic diffusion equation in illitic soils.\n\n\nKeywords: Nonexchangeable K release, extractants, mineralogy, first order, soil depth\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nIt has been well established that a significant proportion of plant needs of\npotassium (K) are met from nonexchangeable fraction of soil K (Mengel\n1985; Srinivasarao et al. 1999, 2000). Under intensive cropping, in the\nabsence of K fertilization, initially exchangeable K in soil contributes to\nplant K nutrition, but with further cropping, exchangeable K attains a\ncertain minimal level; afterward, plant K removal from soil and contribution\nof nonexchangeable K to K uptake are almost synonymous and accounts for\nup to 90\u201395% of the total plant K uptake (Srinivasarao and Khera 1994).\nBecause of the larger contribution of nonexchangeable K to plant K needs,\nlack of crop responses to applied K have been reported even in soils with\nlow exchangeable K (Mengel and Uhlenbecker 1993). The major sources of\nnonexchangeable K in soils are K-rich 2 : 1 clay minerals such as micas and\nvermiculite (Sparks et al. 1987; Moritsuka et al. 2004). However, the\nrelease of K from the interlayer of these minerals may be very slow,\ndepending on the weathering stage of these minerals; therefore, whether the\nK release rates of soils under cropping are in tune with plant K needs\nbecomes the most important aspect as far as K nutrition of crop plants is\nconcerned.\n\nNonexchangeable K in soil is extracted by using several extractants such\nas dilute salt solutions (Lopez-Pineiro and Garcia-Navarro 1997), cation\nexchange resins (Martin and Sparks 1983), organic acids (Song and Huang\n1988), sodium tetraphenyl boran (Cox and Joern 1997), nitric acid (GilSotres and Rubio 1992). Electroultrafiltration (EUF) is also used (Rubio and\nGil-Sotres 1996). Several kinetic equations have been used to study the\nrelease of nonexchangeable K. These include first-order (Srinivasarao et al.\n1998), parabolic diffusion (Sharma and Swami 2000), zero-order\n\n\nRelease Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 475\n\n\n(Srinivasarao et al. 1998) and Elovich equation (Martin and Sparks 1983).\nHowever, different models have been found to fare better in explaining K\nrelease from soil particles or whole soils under particular condition because\nof the differences in release mechanisms (Carey and Metherell 2003). The performance of a particular model may be varying in relation to soil K status\n(Elkhatib and Hern 1988), K-depleted/undepleted soils (Srinivasarao et al.\n1998), extraction media (Sharma and Swami 2000), and stage of extraction\n(early/later) (Burns and Barber 1961). Better performance of parabolic\ndiffusion equation for light textured Chomu and Pali series compared with\nheavy textured Chambal series of India was reported by Sharma and Swami\n(2000) in explaining K release in CaCl 2 solution. Better performance of\nfirst-order equation for smectitic black soils was also reported earlier by\nDhillon et al. (1989) in CaCl 2 medium over illitic alluvial and kaolinitic red\nsoils. Nonexchangeable K release confirmed to first-order kinetics better in\nK-rich clay soils in 0.01 M CaCl 2 medium compared with light textured\nsoils (Sharma and Swami 2000).\nAlthough a major portion of plant nutrients is absorbed by crop plants\nfrom the surface soil, subsoil contribution to nutrition is often substantial\n(Beringer 1985). A great majority of studies on K in soils have been solely\nconcerned with samples collected from the surface soils (0\u201315 cm).\nDifferent forms of K in subsoil (15\u201330 cm) were evaluated in relation to\nthose in surface soil (0\u201315 cm) in 22 benchmark soil series of India, which\nindicated that subsoil K contribution was up to 96% of the surface soils\n(Srinivasarao et al. 2001). The present study examines the nonexchangeable\nK release from different benchmark soils of India representing a wide area\nvarying in their mineralogy and K status. Nonexchangeable K release from\nsubsoils is important because many crops can obtain substantial amounts of\nK from lower layers especially in deep rooted crops. Therefore, the objectives\nof present study are 1) to evaluate the nonexchangeable K release from\nimportant benchmark soils varying in mineralogy, K status, and also in\nrelation to soil depth and extraction media; 2) to evaluate different mathematical models for describing nonexchangeable K release and to find\nwhether their performance varies with mineralogical composition of soils,\nsoil K status, and extraction media; and 3) to examine the relationship of K\nrelease rates obtained in the kinetic studies with conventional soil test\n\nmeasures of K.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nSoil Analysis\n\n\nPhysicochemical and mineralogical properties of six benchmark surface\n(0\u201315 cm) and sub-surface (15\u201330 cm) soils that occur widely in intensively\ncultivated regions in six states of India sampled by Potash Research Institute\n\n\n476 Ch. Srinivasarao et al.\n\n\nof India, Gurgaon, were used in the present study. Details on soil series, location,\ntaxonomic classification, selected soil properties, and soil test K are given in\nTable 1. Soil pH was measured in a 1 : 2.5 (w/v) soil to water mixture by\nusing a glass pH electrode (Elico pH analyzer model LI-612). Organic carbon\n(organic C) was determined by the wet oxidation method of Walkley and\nBlack (1934), and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) was estimated by using the\nmethod of Bundy and Bremner (1972). Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of\nthe soils was determined by the sodium acetate (NaC 2 H 3 O 2 ) method\n(Richards 1954). Different extractable forms of K [e.g., water-soluble\n(Jackson 1973), 1 N NH 4 OAc (Hanway and Heidel 1952), and sodium tetraphenyl boron (NaTPB) (Schulte and Corey, 1965)] were determined.\n\n\nMineralogical Analysis\n\n\nThe mineralogical composition of silt and clay fractions is given in Table 2.\nFor mineralogical analysis, the soils were dispersed in 1% sodium hexametaphosphate with vigorous shaking (Sidhu and Gikes 1977). The sand\nfraction (0.05\u20132 mm) was separated by wet-sieving, and the silt fraction\n(0.002\u20130.05 mm) was separated by sedimentation. The clay (,0.002 mm)\nsuspension was siphoned off after requisite settling time (Jackson 1973).\nThe silt and clay samples were flocculated with excess KCl and MgCl 2 . The\nMg-saturated silt and clay samples were X-rayed, glycolated, and X-rayed\nagain with a Philips diffractometer. Potassium-saturated silt and clay\nsamples were X-rayed after drying for 1 h and again after heating to 5008C\nfor 1 h. Based on the peak area of different reflections, a semiquantitative\nanalysis of different minerals in the silt and clay fractions was undertaken\nby following the procedure of Klages and Hopper (1982).\nKamliakheri and Noyyal soil series belong to Vertisol and Vertic\nsubgroups, are alkaline in pH, calcareous in nature, fine textured, and are\nsmectite dominant soils. Lukhi and Rarha series belong to Inceptisols with\nillite as dominant clay mineral. Kodad and Vijayapura series belong to\nAlfisols and are kaolinite dominant. Soils of Vijayapura series had a considerable amount of amorphous materials, which are mainly hydrous oxides of iron\n(Fe), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and hydrated silico-aluminas. In each\ngroup, two series with wide variation in soil test nonexchangeable K were\nincluded in this study to understand the differences in K chemistry of soils\nwith similar mineralogical composition.\n\n\nNonexchangeable Potassium Release Kinetics\n\n\nNative exchangeable K was removed from surface and subsurface soils before\ninitiating the kinetic studies (Martin and Sparks 1983). For this, soil samples\nwere calcium (Ca) saturated by equilibrating 5 g soil with 0.25 M CaCl 2 three\n\n\nTable 1. Soil properties, mineralogy, and K status\n\n\npH w Org.

One gram each of Ca-saturated\nsoils, in duplicate, suspended in 20mL of 0.01 M CaCl 2, 0.01 M citric acid,\nand 0.01 M HCl media were equilibrated at 258C for 1, 7, 19, 43, 67, 95,\n115, 139, 163, 187, 211, 235, 259, 283, 307, 331, 355, 379, 403, and 427 h\nby shaking for 1 h before the suspensions were centrifuged for 10min at\n10,000 \ufffd g. The supernatant liquid was measured for K by flame photometer\n(Elico Model CL-360).\nNonexchangeable K released with time was fitted by using the different\nequations (Martin and Sparks 1983).\n\n\nFirst-order reaction: ln\u00f0K 0 \ufffd K t \u00de \u00bc a \ufffd bt\nParabolic diffusion: K t =K 0 \u00bc a \u00fe bt [1][=][2]\n\nZero-order reaction: \u00f0K 0 \ufffd K t \u00de \u00bc a \ufffd bt\nElovich equation: K t \u00bc a \u00fe b lnt\n\n\nwhere K t is the cumulative K released (mg/kg) at time t (hours), K 0 is the\nmaximum cumulative K released (mg/kg), and a and b are constants. Four\nmodels were tested by the least-square regression analysis to determine\nwhich equation described better the nonexchangeable K release from the\nsoils. Standard error of the estimate (SE) was calculated by\nSE \u00bc [(q 2 q [\ufffd] ) [2] /n 2 2)] [1][/][2], where q and q [\ufffd] represent the measured and calculated amounts of nonexchangeable K in soil at time t, respectively, and n is the\nnumber of data points evaluated. The rate constants of K release from soils in\ndifferent media of extraction were calculated on the basis of these models.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nNonexchangeable Potassium Release\n\n\nThe pattern of successive extraction of nonexchangeable K from soils\nbelonging to three mineralogically different soil series (i.e., smectitic\nNoyyal, illitic Rarha, and kaolinitic Vijayapura in different media of extraction] is presented in Figure 1. The amounts of K released during 427 h of\nextraction period was generally higher in smectite dominant soils followed\nby illite and kaolinite dominant soils (Table 3). However, there were deviations in the nonexchangeable K release in the citric acid medium where\nillitic Lukhi series (0\u201315 cm) and kaolinitic Kodad series (15\u201330 cm)\nshowed larger K release than smectitic Kamliakheri series. The amount of\nK extracted was greater in the first 3\u20134 extractions, decreased in later extractions, and then remained nearly constant after 10\u201311 extractions (Carey and\nMetherell 2003; Pannu et al. 2003). Within each group, there was a wide\nvariation in the cumulative K release between soils (Table 2). Kamliakheri\n\n\n480 Ch. Srinivasarao et al.\n\n\nFigure 1.

The difference\nbetween nonexchangeable K release between two series could be due to\nvariation in clay mineral composition in silt and clay fractions of soil\n(Table 2).

Srinivasarao et al.\n\n\ndominant minerals in clay fraction and in silt fraction, feldspars \u00fe quartz was\nthe dominant mineral. In Noyyal soil series, smectite and illite were the\ndominant mineral followed by feldspars \u00fe quartz, and kaolinite in clay\nfraction, and feldspars \u00fe quartz and illite in silt fraction. Presence of considerable amounts of K-rich minerals, such as illite in silt and clay fractions of soils\nwith fine texture, could result in larger K release as in Noyyal series.\nLukhi and Rarha series belonging to Inceptisols showed considerable\ndifferences in nonexchangeable K release. Rarha series showed higher K\nrelease than Lukhi series, irrespective of soil depth and extraction medium.\nIn both cases, illite was the dominant mineral followed by chlorite, vermiculite, feldspars \u00fe quartz, and kaolinite in clay fraction. Illite was dominant in\nsilt fraction of both Rarha and Lukhi series. Similarly, in kaolinitic soils, considerable quantities of illite in silt and clay fractions of Kodad series resulted\nin larger K release than Vijayapura series. Thus, fine texture, together with\nillite/mica dominance in silt and clay factions of soils, are major factors for\nlarger nonexchangeable K release in soils. Several authors reported earlier\nthat soils of fine texture showed larger K release than coarse textured soils\n(Martin and Sparks 1983). On the basis of relationships established between\nK replenishment rates of soils and amount and nature of clay minerals in\nillitic alluvial soils (Srinivasarao and Khera 1994) and smectitic Vertisols\n(Srinivasarao et al. 1998) it was stated that the release of K from nonexchangeable source depends mainly on the composition of clay minerals in soils.\nAlthough soils having high clay are generally associated with high reserves\nof soil K, it is not essentially true for all the soils.\nSurface soils (0\u201315 cm) showed larger cumulative K release in smectitic\nand illitic soils than subsurface (15\u201330 cm) soils, irrespective of the medium\nof extraction. In kaolinitic soils, surface soils showed either the same or lower\n\nK release than subsurface soils. This result could be due to downward\n\nmovement of finer particles with leaching during rainy seasons. Therefore,\nsubsoil K plays an important role in Alfisols soils, which are generally low\nin K because of lower levels of K-bearing minerals. Evaluating the subsoil\nK availability of 22 benchmark soil series of India, Srinivasarao et al.\n(2001) reported that light textured red and lateritic and acidic alluvial soils\nhad larger K availability in subsurface soils than surface soils.\nCumulative K release varied significantly among the media of extraction.\nIn all the soils, larger amount of K was extracted in 0.01 M citric acid followed\nby 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M HCl. The differences in K release among the\nextraction media could be attributed to differences in their nature of reaction\n\nin soil. Larger amount of K released in citric acid is due to the dissociated\nH [\u00fe] ions and complexing organic ligands in the organic acid medium. The\nlow molecular weight organic acids with OH and COOH groups in the orthoposition tend to form metal-organic complexes in solution with some metal\nions from mineral structures (Kononova et al. 1964), thus accelerating the\nmineral decomposition. Although the HCl medium also possesses proton\nsource, the mechanism is restricted only to exchange of H [\u00fe] ions with K [\u00fe]\n\n\nRelease Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 483\n\n\nions of minerals. Once exchange positions are filled with H [\u00fe], further exchange\nfrom highly selective sites of minerals is difficult with dilute acid solutions. In\n0.01 M CaCl 2, the K [\u00fe] ions on the surface of mineral structure are exchanged by\nCa [2][\u00fe] in the CaCl 2 solution. Because of larger size of Ca [2][\u00fe] ions and hydration\nenergy (Rich 1968), it does not exchange easily with K further in the interlayer.\nThe efficiency of citric acid medium was greater than CaCl 2 solution in\nillitic soils than in smectitic and kaolinitic soils. The increase in extracted K\nwas 20 (68 mg/kg) to 43% (114 mg/kg) in smectitic soils, 85 (104 mg/kg)\nto 81% (74 mg/kg) in illitic soils, and 19 (16 mg/kg) to 50% (41 mg/kg) in\nkaolinitic soils, respectively.\n\n\nMathematical Models\n\n\nDifferent mathematical models (e.g., first-order, parabolic diffusion equation,\nzero-order, and Elovich) were tested for their suitability to describe the release\nof nonexchangeable K from six mineralogically different benchmark soils\n(i.e., Kamliakheri, Noyyal, Lukhi, Rarha, Kodad, and Vijayapura (Table 4).\nResults showed that parabolic diffusion equation described the reaction\nrates fairy well, as evidenced by the highest coefficient of determination\nvalues for 0.01 M CaCl 2 (r [2] \u00bc 0.92\u20130.99; mean \u00bc 0.98), 0.01 M citric acid\n(r [2] \u00bc 0.94\u20130.99; mean \u00bc 0.98), and 0.01 M HCl (r [2] \u00bc 0.73\u20130.98;\nmean \u00bc 0.93), respectively. The lowest standard error values ranged from\n0.02 to 0.05 (mean \u00bc 0.03) for CaCl 2, from 0.03 to 0.05 (mean \u00bc 0.03) for\ncitric acid, and from 0.03 to 0.08 (mean \u00bc 0.05) for HCl media. This result\nshows that rate of K release from nonexchangeable fraction is a function of\nthe reciprocal of [p] t and is diffusion controlled exchange reaction from the\nmineral matrix or weathered periphery. The fit of K t /K 0 and the [p] t for the\nthree benchmark surface and subsurface soils with varied mineralogy and K\nstatus is shown in Figure 2. Successful description of K release by parabolic\ndiffusion equation of K was reported by Martin and Sparks (1983) for\nKalmia and Kennansville soils of the United States and by Dhillon et al.\n(1989) and Srinivasarao et al. (2000) for some Indian soils. However, there\nwere some differences in r [2] and SE values of parabolic diffusion equation\namong soil series and extraction media. Relatively higher r [2] and lower SE\nvalues were observed for illitic and kaolinitic soils than for smectitic soils.\nAmong the media, citric acid and CaCl 2 showed higher r [2] and lower SE\nvalues. Followed by parabolic diffusion equation, first-order kinetic\nequation also explained well the nonexchangeable K release from soils as\nindicated by higher mean r [2] values of 0.94 in all three extractants and lower\nSE ranging from 0.26 to 0.29 (Table 4). The performance of first-order\nequation holds good irrespective of extraction medium, but it explained\nbetter for smectitic soils (r [2] \u00bc 0.95\u20130.96) than for kaolinitic soils\n(r [2] \u00bc 0.91\u20130.92).

There were considerable differences\n\nin rate constants between surface and subsurface soils.\n\nFirst-order release rate constants showed larger values for smectitic soils\nfollowed by illitic and kaolinitic soils. For all soils, 0.01 M citric acid medium\nshowed greater release rate constants followed by 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M\nHCl. The rate constants for smectitic soils varied from 99.99 to\n101.55 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h, for illitic soils from 81.02 to 91.38 \ufffd 10 [\u20134] /h, and for\nkaolinitic soils from 63.81 to 81.26 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h. The mean rate constants for\nall the soils were 91.40 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h in citric acid, 84.45 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h in CaCl 2\nand 81.47 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h in HCl media. The rate constants observed in the\npresent study were comparable with those reported by Munn et al. (1976)\nfor K release from soil separates (22.8\u201356.2 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h) and Srinivasarao\net al. (1998) for some smectitic soils of central India (126\u2013153 \ufffd 10 [2][4] /h)\nin 0.01 M CaCl 2 . In all the soils 20\u201350% of K release occurred within 7 h\nof extraction period. Thereafter, the release was a slow and continuing\nprocess. The rapid initial release may be from the easily accessible sites on\nthe external planar surfaces and peripheral edge sites, whereas the later\nslow release may be from the interlayer sites of the clay complex (Bolt\net al. 1963). In all the soil groups, the finer the soil texture, the higher were\nthe rate constants. Smectitic soils with higher clay content and larger edge\nand wedge sites showed greater release rate constants. Higher K release\nrates in citric acid medium compared with CaCl 2 and HCl indicates greater\nmobilization of K by citric acid, especially during the later stages of K\nrelease by complexing organic ligands (Song and Huang 1988). This trend\nwas very much pronounced in illitic soil series (Table 3). This finding\nwas in accordance with Sposito\u2019s hypothesis that the surface bearing\ncharged siloxane ditrigonal cavities in soils reacts with dissolved organic\nmatter and forms complexes through exchangeable cations (Sposito 1984).\nLower K release rate constants in CaCl 2 could be due to larger size of\nhydrated Ca [2][\u00fe] (4.3 A [\u02da ] ) than hydrated K [\u00fe] (3.3 A [\u02da ] ); therefore, wedge zones\nwould selectively screen out the Ca [2][\u00fe] ion because of its larger size (Martin\nand Sparks 1983).\nGreater K release rate constants in smectitic soils could be due to fine\ntexture and larger wedge zones, and its swelling clay where the exchange is\nrelatively easier, whereas K [\u00fe] in illitic soils is held tightly and exchange is\nslower. This may be the reason for better performance of first-order equation\nfor smectitic soils irrespective of medium. Kaolinitic soils with light texture\nand lower amounts of K mica/illitic and vermiculite showed lower K\nrelease rates. Although illite-dominant alluvial soils possess large amount of\nnonexchangeable K reserves (NaTPB-K) as shown in Table 1, its release is\nslower. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient values between soil test nonexchangeable K extracted in NaTPB and cumulative K release in different\nextraction media were lower (r [2] \u00bc 0.58\u20130.72). Once the illitic soils were\nexcluded, including smectitic and kaolinitic soils, r [2] values improved substantially (r [2] \u00bc 0.94\u20130.95). Because of this reason, illite-rich alluvial soils, even\n\n\nRelease Kinetics of Nonexchangeable Potassium 489\n\n\nthough with high nonexchangeable K status, may suffer from K deficiency\nunder intensive cropping because the rate of K release from nonexchangeable to exchangeable/solution phase is not sufficient to meet the plant K\nuptake.\nRate constants of parabolic diffusion equation in different media ranged\nfrom 28.03 to 36.08 \ufffd 10 [2][3] /h for smectitic soils, 28.84 to 41.25 \ufffd 10 [2][3] /h\nfor illitic soils, and 27.30 to 40.78 \ufffd 10 [2][3] /h for kaolinitic soils. Unlike\nthose of first-order equation, smectitic soils showed lower release rate\nconstants than illitic and kaolinitic soils in all the three media of extraction.\n\nRelease rate constants of parabolic diffusion equation depend on diffusion\ngradient between interlayer (source) and exchange surfaces (sink) in the\nclay structure because it assumes that the rate-limiting step is the diffusion\nof K ions from the interior of the particle to surface. Lower exchangeable K\non clay surface and larger interlayer K in illite clay structure resulted in\nlarger diffusion gradients in illitic soils, hence the higher release rate\nconstants than smectitic and kaolinitic soils. This finding may be the most\nprobable reason for better performance of parabolic diffusion equation in\nillitic soils. The lowest magnitude of parabolic rate constants in case of\nsmectitic black soils could be attributed to higher clay content.\nSimilarly intercept (a) values of the first-order and parabolic models were\nhigher for smectitic soils followed by illitic and kaolinitic soils (Table 5). The\npositive and highly significant correlation (r [2] \u00bc 0.94) between nonexchangeable K extracted in NaTPB and intercept values of the first-order equation as\nthe extrapolated intercept is assumed to be proportional to the initial concentration in soil solution at time \u00bc 0. Therefore, the higher the intercept values,\nthe greater was the initial soil test K (Elkhatib and Hern 1988).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nFor assessing K fertilizer needs, the information on nonexchangeable K\nrelease from smectitic, illitic soils, and kaolinitic soils should be taken into\nconsideration. The study further indicated that the 0.01 M citric acid\nextracted more K than did 0.01 M CaCl 2 and 0.01 M HCl in these soils.\nFurthermore, citric acid medium was found to be superior in extracting nonexchangeable K from illitic soils compared with smectitic and kaolinitic\nsoils. The better fit of the first-order model to the data for smectitic soils\nthan for illitic soils and also the relatively better fit of the parabolic model\nto the data for illitic soils than for smectitic soils would suggest that the\nrate-limiting step is either film diffusion or exchange reaction for smectites\n(due to their swelling nature) and intraparticular diffusion for illites (the interlayer space being more closed). Thus, the information generated from\nthe different kinetic models can help to explain the release mechanisms in\nmineralogically dissimilar soils.\n\n\n490 Ch.

Merr.] with different K efficiency. Two K high-efficiency\nvegetable soybean genotypes (Line 19 and Line 20) and two K low-efficiency genotypes\n(Line 7 and Line 36) were investigated in low K and normal K conditions. The root\nof K high-efficiency genotypes had a higher K [+] affinity associated with a higher\nmaximum K [+] uptake rate ( _I_ max), but lower Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption ( _K_ m)\nand lower compensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min). Seedlings of K highefficiency genotypes also had higher root vigor [triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)\nreduction method] and greater absorbing activity (methylene blue method), especially\nin the low K condition. Furthermore, the root bleeding-sap rate of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes in low K stress was 9.9\u201324.3% greater than that of normal K conditions,\n\nwhich was accompanied by a relatively higher K concentration of root bleeding-sap\nin contributing to K [+] upward flux. The root of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean\ngenotypes exhibited K [+] high-affinity and driving advantages. Photosynthetic parameters\nof K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes were less affected by low K stress.\nLow K stress decreased the net photosynthetic rate of K high-efficiency genotypes by\n6.1\u20136.9%, while that of K low-efficiency genotypes decreased by 10.9\u201315.7%. The\nhigher chlorophyll (Chl) a/b ratio with enhanced relative content of Chl a in response\nto low K stress might be an adapted mechanism for K high-efficiency genotypes\nto maintain photosynthetic capacity. Stronger root K affinity drivers associated with\n\nphotosynthetic adaptability to low K stress are the key factors in determining the K\nhigh-efficiency of vegetable soybeans.\n\n\nKeywords: potassium, potassium efficiency, bleeding sap, chlorophyll a/b ratio, vegetable soybean\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 1 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nPotassium application benefits vegetable soybean yield and\nquality (Liu et al., 2017), while the direct absorption and\nutilization of available potassium by plants in cultivated soil\nare always essential (Singh and Reddy, 2017; Chen et al., 2020;\nDev et al., 2021). Selecting and breeding potassium (K) efficient\nvarieties of vegetable soybean is an important biological means\nin making full use of K resources (Rengel and Damon, 2008).\nPrevious studies have shown that there are great differences in K\nefficiency among different genotypes. For instance, intraspecific\nvariations in K efficiency have been reported in many crops\nincluding rice (Yang et al., 2003), wheat (Zhang et al., 1999;\nDamon and Rengel, 2007), sweet potato (Wang et al., 2015),\ntomato (Chen and Gabelman, 1995), and soybean (Sale and\nCampell, 1987; Wang C. et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019b).\nDifferences in the K efficiency of crops can be understood\nfrom two main aspects, such as (1) the difference in K uptake\nefficiency and (2) the difference in K utilization efficiency (Rengel\nand Damon, 2008). The utilization efficiency of K refers to the\nability of the crop to convert unit K into dry matter yield (Wang\net al., 2018). K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes are\ngood at redistributing K and dry matters with higher harvest\nindex (HI) and higher K harvest index (KHI) (Liu et al.,\n2019b). K uptake efficiency emphasizes the capacity of root K\nabsorption (Tsialtas et al., 2017). The higher specific K uptake rate\n(total K content/total root length) in K high-efficiency vegetable\nsoybean genotypes ensures the supply of K to the whole plant.\nBesides, K high-efficiency genotypes also have a strong ability\nto regulate their root architecture to adapt to low K conditions\n(Liu et al., 2019a).\nExcept for root morphology, K uptake kinetic parameters,\nroot bleeding-sap, and root vigor are also demonstrated as\neffective parameters in evaluating K uptake efficiency (Teo\net al., 1992; Hao et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,\n2017). Sufficient K can increase plant hydraulic conductance and\ntranspiration (Pettigrew, 2008). The vigorous root can increase\nnutrient and water uptake, promoting the whole plant growth.\nFor instance, the root bleeding-sap and the upward fluxes of\nK are higher in the cotton cultivars with high K efficiency\n(Yang, 2011). As substrates for photosynthesis, water and mineral\nelements absorbed by plant roots are transported upward by\ntranspiration (Liu et al., 2016). Improved root characteristics\nmay contribute to plant-water status, enhanced photosynthesis,\nbiomass, and yield of soybean cultivars (Cui et al., 2016). In\ncotton, K efficient genotype 103 has more suitable K absorption\nkinetic parameters and more efficient photosynthate transport\n(Hao et al., 2015, 2016). Thus, the uptake power of the root\nsystem determines the supply of nutrients in the above-ground\npart of the plant.\nLess photosynthetic assimilates and reduced assimilate\ntransport out of the leaves to the developing fruit greatly\ncontribute to the negative consequences that deficiencies of\nK have on yield and quality production (Pettigrew, 2008).\nGenotypic variations in photosynthetic decline caused by K\ndeficiency have been reported. For instance, compared with the\nK-inefficient cotton cultivar, the K-efficient cultivar has a higher\n\n\n\nnet photosynthetic rate (Pn) associated with higher biomass\nproducts (Wang N. et al., 2012).\nHence, understanding how plants take up and use K\nis of scientific and practical importance. Research into this\nmechanism has become increasingly urgent as a result of major\necological and agricultural issues. In our previous studies, K\nhigh-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes were demonstrated\nwith a strong K uptake and redistribution ability (Liu et al.,\n2019a,b). However, the root uptake dynamics and photosynthetic\ncharacteristics of K high-efficiency vegetable soybean are still\nnot clear. Therefore, this study compared the differences of\nroot activity, root bleeding-sap, the upward fluxes of K, K\nkinetics parameters, photosynthetic parameters, and chlorophyll\ncontent between K high-efficiency and K low-efficiency vegetable\nsoybean genotypes. The data obtained revealed the mechanisms\nunderlying K absorption and utilization of high-efficiency in\nvegetable soybean.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nPlant Material\n\nBased on previous K efficiency selection (Liu et al., 2019a), two\nK high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes (Line 19 and Line\n20) and two K low-efficiency genotypes (Line 7 and Line 36) were\nused in this study. Compared with K low-efficiency genotypes, the\nK high-efficiency genotypes have higher K agronomic efficiency\n(KAE), recovery, internal utilization-efficiency rate (KIUE), and\nspecific K uptake rate (Liu et al., 2019a,b). Greater reductions\nin K concentration of vegetative organs were found in K highefficiency genotypes than K low-efficiency genotypes in low K\nconditions (Liu et al., 2019b). All genotypes were released by\nthe Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, Harbin, China.\n\n\nExperimental Design\nA pot experiment was conducted at the agronomy farm of\nNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, Harbin, China (45 [\u25e6] 732N, 126 [\u25e6] 612E;\naltitude 128 m a.s.l.) in 2017. The soil used was a typical Mollisol\n(Black soil) with the following properties: soil pH 6.6, organic\nmatter 28.9 g kg [\u2212][1], total N 2.3 g kg [\u2212][1], total P 1.3 g kg [\u2212][1], total K\n18.9 g kg [\u2212][1], available N 159 mg kg [\u2212][1], available P 57.0 mg kg [\u2212][1],\nand available K 85 mg kg [\u2212][1] (insufficient for vegetable soybean\nyield and quality; Liu et al., 2017). The experiment was conducted\nin a completely random design with three replicates and five pots\nper replicate. About 3 seeds per pot were sown in May 2017 with\nregular manual pest and weed control. The pot size was 32 cm in\ndiameter by 27 cm tall. A uniform fertilizer application at seeding\nincluded 70 kg ha [\u2212][1] diammonium phosphate and 98 kg ha [\u2212][1]\n\nurea. Treatments consisted of two K-fertilizer rates at seeding,\nK 2 SO 4 0 kg ha [\u2212][1] (K0) and K 2 SO 4 120 kg ha [\u2212][1] (K120). Plants\nwere randomly harvested at fourth-node (V4), full bloom (R2),\nbeginning seed (R5), and full seed (R6) stages (Fehr et al., 1971)\nfor root bleeding-sap and K upward fluxes measurement.\nA hydroponic experiment was used for K [+] absorption kinetic\nparameters, root vigor, and root absorbing activity test.

Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\n\nof the four selected genotypes were sterilized and germinated\non moistened filter paper in a plant growth chamber at 60%\nhumidity and 28 [\u25e6] C, under a 16 h light, 8 h dark cycle for 3\u2013\n4 days. After that, the seedlings were transferred into light-proof\nglass boxes (volume 15 cm [3] \u00d7 20 cm [3] \u00d7 20 cm [3] ) with halfstrength modified Hoagland nutrient solution, as described by\nWang C. et al. (2012). There were six replications in each box.\nThe cotyledons of all samples were excised to eliminate any\nadditional supply of nutrients. When the plants grew to the\nfirst trifoliolate stage (V1), they were treated with half-strength\nHoagland nutrient solution with different concentrations of\nK [+] (0.5 and 3 mmol L [\u2212][1] ). The K source was K 2 SO 4 . The\ninitial pH value of the nutrient solution was 6, which was\nadjusted by 0.1 mol L [\u2212][1] NaOH or 0.1 mol L [\u2212][1] HCl. After\ntransplanting, the samples were continuously cultured for 9 days.\nThe nutrient solution was changed every 3 days and kept\nenough O 2 by regular ventilation with an air pump. The pH\nvalue of the solution was adjusted to 6 when the nutrient\nsolution was changed.\n\n\nMeasurements\n\nCollection of root bleeding-sap: root bleeding-sap collection was\nbased on the method used by Cui et al. (2016) with slight\nimprovements in the pot experiments. The root bleeding-sap\nwas conducted from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at V4, R2, R5,\nand R6 stages. The plants were cut with branch scissors at\ncotyledons position, and the cross-section was cleaned with\na small amount of absorbent cotton and then immediately\nconnected to the root bleeding-sap collection device and the\njoint was sealed. The collected root bleeding-sap was temporarily\nstored in a refrigerator at 4 [\u25e6] C for measurement. The formula was\nas follows: root bleeding-sap rate (g h [\u2212][1] per plant) = bleedingsap weight/4 h.\nWhere K upward fluxes = root bleeding-sap rate \u00d7 K\nconcentration, K concentration was determined by flame\nspectrophotometer (INESA FP6400A, Shanghai, China) (Liu\net al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2017).\nK [+] absorption kinetic parameters: A measurement of a\ndepletion curve of a single plant. Five replicates per genotype\nwere conducted. After K deficiency and starvation for 48 h,\nsamples under the treatment of K3 at 9 days were immersed\nin 0.2 mmol L [\u2212][1] CaSO 4 solutions three times, dried, and put\ninto a 200 ml absorption solution. The composition of the\nabsorption solution was 0.05 mmol L [\u2212][1] potassium chloride\n(KCl) + 0.2 mmol L [\u2212][1] CaSO 4 . The absorption solution\nwas placed in a dark conical flask, the culture temperature\nwas (25 \u00b1 2) [\u25e6] C, and the light intensity was 210\u2013260 mol\nm [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] . Parameter calculation including the maximum K [+]\n\nuptake rate ( _I_ max), Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption\n(Km), compensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min), and\nstatistical analysis refers to the modified method of Epstein\nand Hagen (1952) and Claassen and Barber (1977). _C_ min\nrepresents the concentration of K [+] in the solution when\nthe concentration remains constant. Ion consumption curve\nequation: Y = a + bX + cX [2] (1), take the negative derivative\nof the equation: Y\u2019 = b + 2cX (2). Hence, if X goes to 0,\nthen Y\u2019 = b = Km.\n\n\n\nRoot vigor, as determined by enzymatic reduction assay of\ntriphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was conducted according\nto the modified protocol of Duncan and Widholm (2004).\nRoot absorption activity was determined by methylene blue\nadsorption (Zhang and Yan, 2003; Song and Wang, 2005). First,\nthe root volume is converted to 1 ml = 1 g. The root was put\ninto a solution with a known concentration of methylene blue for\n1.5 min. Removed and placed the root into the second beaker,\nrepeated twice.

Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nComparison of K **[+]** Absorption Kinetic\nParameters Between Two K Efficiency\nGenotypes\n**Table 1** shows the K [+] kinetics absorption parameters of the\nfour vegetable soybean genotypes in a hydroponic experiment.\nThe maximum K [+] uptake rate ( _I_ max) in K high-efficiency\ngenotypes was around 58.2\u201365.5 \u00b5mol g [\u2212][1] min [\u2212][1] FW, which\nwas significantly higher than that of K low-efficiency genotypes\naround 42.4\u201354.1 \u00b5mol g [\u2212][1] min [\u2212][1] FW ( _P <_ 0.05). The\ncompensation concentration for K [+] uptake ( _C_ min) in K highefficiency genotypes was 0.83\u20131.32 \u00b5mol L [\u2212][1], which was lower\nthan that of K low-efficiency genotypes (3.16\u20133.22 \u00b5mol L [\u2212][1] )\n( _P_ <0.05). The Michaelis constant for K [+] absorption (Km) is\na parameter evaluating the affinity between root and K [+] . The\ngreater the value, the smaller the affinity. Higher affinity was\nfound in K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes with a\nlower Km of 32.8\u201335.0 \u00b5mol L [\u2212][1] than that of 48.6\u201349 \u00b5mol L [\u2212][1]\n\nin K low-efficiency genotypes ( _P <_ 0.05).\n\n\nRoot Bleeding-Sap and Upward Fluxes\nof K **[+]** in the Pot Experiment\nAs shown in **Figure 1**, root bleeding-sap rate per plant showed\na trend of increasing first and then decreasing from the fourthnode (V4) to full seed (R6) stage with the maximum at full bloom\n(R2) stage. The root bleeding-sap rate per plant of Line 20 was\nthe highest among the four genotypes with 1.8 ml h [\u2212][1] root [\u2212][1] in\nK0 and 1.6 ml h [\u2212][1] root [\u2212][1] in K120, respectively. Compared with\nK120 treatment, K0 treatment increased the average of the root\nbleeding-sap rate per plant over the four stages by 9.9\u201324.3% in\nK high-efficiency genotypes, but by \u20132.2\u20135.1% in K low-efficiency\ngenotypes. On the other hand, the root bleeding-sap rate per root\nlength in four genotypes was found higher at the V4\u2013R2 stage,\ndropped down at the R5\u2013R6 stage. Interestingly, K high-efficiency\ngenotypes had a higher root bleeding-sap rate per root length\ncompared with K low-efficiency genotypes at the beginning seed\nstage ( _P <_ 0.05). At this time, root bleeding-sap rate per root\nlength ranged 0.09\u20130.13 ml h [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1] in K0 and 0.10\u20130.15 ml\nh [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment, while in K low-efficiency genotypes\nkept around 0.05 ml h [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1] in K0 and 0.05\u20130.07 ml h [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1]\n\nin K120 treatment.\nHigher K upward fluxes were found in K120 treatment over\nthe four genotypes, which was accompanied consistently by a\nhigher concentration of K in the root bleeding-sap ( **Figure 2** ).\n\n\nTABLE 1 | Comparison of K [+] absorption kinetic parameters of root systems\nbetween two potassium (K) efficiency types under low K stress.\n\n\nLine 19 Line 20 Line 7 Line 36\n\n\nImax (\u00b5mol g [\u2212][1] min [\u2212][1] root FW [\u2212][1] ) 65.0 a 58.2 b 42.4 d 54.1 c\n\nKm (\u00b5mol L [\u2212][1] ) 35.0 b 32.8 c 49.0 a 48.6 a\n\n_C_ min (\u00b5mol L [\u2212][1] ) 1.32 b 0.83 c 3.16 a 3.22 a\n\n\n_Different letters within the same row indicate statistical significance at the_\n_P < 0.05 level._\n\n\n\nThe K flux rate per root length was highest at the fourth-node\nstage, with plant growth K flux rate per root length decreased.\nAt the beginning seed stage, K high-efficiency genotypes had\na higher K flux rate per root length and K concentration of\nroot bleeding sap compared with K low-efficiency genotypes\n( _P <_ 0.05). The K flux rate per root length of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes was 19.4\u201332.4 \u00b5g h [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1] in K0 and 24.1\u201337.2 \u00b5g\nh [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment, that of 7.6\u20138.7 \u00b5g h [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1] in K0\nand 9\u201315.2 \u00b5g h [\u2212][1] cm [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment in K low-efficiency\ngenotypes. Meanwhile, K concentration of root bleeding-sap in\nK high-efficiency genotypes reached 51.1\u201363.2 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in K0\nand 60.2\u201364 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment at the beginning seed\nstage, which was significantly higher than that of K low-efficiency\ngenotypes with 41.1\u201348 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in K0 and 46.1\u201352.4 \u00b5g ml [\u2212][1] in\nK120 treatment ( _P <_ 0.05).\nCorrelation analysis revealed that K upward fluxes rate\nper root length and K concentration of root bleeding-sap\nwere positively correlated with K concentration per plant\n( _P <_ 0.05) ( **Table 2** ).\n\n\nRoot Vigor and Absorbing Activity\nThe root vigor was tested in a hydroponic experiment using the\nmeasurement of respiratory activity with triphenyl tetrazolium\nchloride (TTC) ( **Figure 3** ). At the seedling stage (9 days after\ntreatment), the root vigor of K high-efficiency genotypes was\ninduced by low K stress. Low K stress (K0.5) increased the root\nvigor of K high-efficiency genotypes by 46\u201385% compared with\nnormal K treatment (K3) ( _P <_ 0.05). Although no consistent\ntrend was observed in K low-efficiency genotypes, low K stress\ndecreased root vigor by 21% in Line 36 ( _P <_ 0.05). The highest\nroot vigor of 516 \u00b5g g [\u2212][1] FW h [\u2212][1] was found in Line 20 under\nlow K conditions.\nThe root absorbing activity parameters are shown in **Table 3** .\nHigher total absorbing area and actively absorbing area were\nfound in K high-efficiency genotypes. Meanwhile, in K highefficiency genotypes, low K stress increased the actively absorbing\narea by 21.4\u201330.6% and the total absorbing area by 9.6\u201319%\n( _P <_ 0.05). In contrast, an opposite trend was found in\nK low-efficiency genotypes. Under low K stress, the actively\nabsorbing area decreased by 6.1\u201310.3% and the total absorbing\narea decreased by 6.6\u201315.7% ( _P >_ 0.05). Furthermore, K highefficiency genotypes also had a higher ratio of total absorbing\narea to root volume, especially in Line 19 with 62.3 m [2] cm [\u2212][3]\n\n(K0.5) and 60.2 m [2] cm [\u2212][3] (K3). Low K stress increased the ratio\nof actively absorbing area to total absorbing area by 9.3\u20139.4%\nin K high-efficiency genotype ( _P <_ 0.05), but by 0.6\u20135% in K\nlow-efficiency genotypes ( _P >_ 0.05).\n\n\nComparison of Photosynthetic\nParameters Between Two K Efficiency\nGenotypes\nA pot experiment was conducted to determine photosynthetic\nparameters of two K efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes\naffected by K deficiency (K0) are shown in **Figure 4** .

From full\nbloom to full seed stage, the Pn increased first and then decreased.\nThe maximum value occurred at the full pod (R4) stage of the\nK low-efficiency genotype Line 36, which reached 28.8 \u00b5mol\nCO 2 m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] and 33.8 \u00b5mol CO 2 m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] under K0 and\nK120 treatments, respectively. Meanwhile, from full pod to full\nseed stage, the dramatic decline of the Pn was found in K lowefficiency genotypes. The Pn of Line 36 decreased by 87.2% in\nK0 and 86.2% in K120 treatment ( _P <_ 0.05), and that of Line 7\ndecreased by 54.3% in K0 and 59% in K120 treatment. Whereas\nthe decline of the Pn in K high-efficiency genotypes was around\n33.5\u201351.8% in K0 and 36.7\u201341.1% in K120 treatment, which was\nnot as much as that of K low-efficiency genotypes.\nPotassium deficiency also decreased the stomatal conductance\n(Gs) in all genotypes, but K high-efficiency genotypes were less\naffected. The decrease of Gs by K deficiency was 7.5\u20137.8% in\nK high-efficiency genotypes, but 9.4\u201312.5% in K low-efficiency\ngenotypes. Low K treatment had the most obvious effect on Gs\nat the beginning seed stage.\nAs opposed to Pn and Gs, K deficiency increased the\nintercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci), especially in K lowefficiency genotypes. The increase of Ci by K deficiency was\n7.3\u20137.9% in K low-efficiency genotypes, but 2\u20136% in K highefficiency genotypes.\n\n\n\nPotassium deficiency decreased the transpiration rate (Tr)\nof all genotypes. Across the five stages, Tr of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes was around 8.8\u20139.8 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K0 and\n9\u201310.1 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment, which was\nhigher than that of 7.1\u20138.2 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K0 and 7.1\u2013\n8.6 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment in K low-efficiency\ngenotypes. At the full seed stage, higher Tr was found in K highefficiency genotypes with 4\u20134.5 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K0 and\n4.2\u20134.7 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment, but only 1\u2013\n1.2 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] and 1.4 \u20131.6 mmol H 2 O m [\u2212][2] s [\u2212][1] in\nK low-efficiency genotypes.\n\n\nChlorophyll\nPot experiment indicated that K deficiency significantly\ndecreased leaf chlorophyll content of the four vegetable soybean\ngenotypes ( **Table 4** ). The average total Chl content in the\nfour growth stages of K high-efficiency genotypes was 2.29\u2013\n2.53 mg g [\u2212][1] in K0 and 2.89\u20132.91 mg g [\u2212][1] in K120 treatment,\nwhich was lower than that of K low-efficiency genotypes\nwith 2.57\u20133.2 mg g [\u2212][1] in K0 and 3.08\u20133.5 mg g [\u2212][1] in K120\ntreatment. However, K deficiency increased the ratio of Chl\na to Chl b, especially in K high-efficiency genotypes. The\nratio of Chl a to Chl b was increased by 36.2\u201338.1% in K\nhigh-efficiency genotypes ( _P <_ 0.05), but only by 6\u20139.8% in K\nlow-efficiency genotypes.\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 5 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al.

The results indicated that K high-efficiency\nvegetable soybean genotypes against low K condition by\nincreasing root bleeding-sap rate per plant and maintaining\nhigher root bleeding-sap rate per root length at the beginning\nseed stage. The root bleeding-sap rate of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes in low K stress was 9.9\u201324.3% greater than that of\nnormal K conditions, which was accompanied by the relatively\nhigher K concentration of root bleeding-sap in contributing to\nK [+] upward flux. In K high-efficiency cotton cultivars, higher root\nbleeding-sap and K upward fluxes could also be induced by low\nK stress (Yang, 2011). Suitable grafting would help watermelon\nseedlings accumulate more K by increasing root bleeding-sap\nvolume and the total K in the root bleeding-sap (Huang et al.,\n2013). Due to the rate of root bleeding-sap is closely related to\nplant nutrient supply, water transport, and even photosynthesis\n(Guan et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), increased rate\nof root bleeding-sap under K deficiency might be an important\nregulatory mechanism for vegetable soybean efficient uptake K.\nBesides, beginning seed stage is a most important period for seed\nestablishment, the higher root bleeding-sap rate per root length\nin K high-efficiency vegetable soybean genotypes accompanied\nby higher K upward fluxes rate per root length and higher K\nconcentration of root bleeding-sap is positively correlated with\nplant K concentration ( _P <_ 0.05). This is another evidence\ndemonstrating that the root of K high-efficiency genotypes has a\nstronger affinity for K [+] .\nPotassium kinetic parameters and root activities are also\nimportant factors assessing K efficiency when plants suffering\nlow K stress (Silberbush and Barber, 1983; Cui et al., 2016;\nWhite et al., 2018). The present study revealed a lower\nMichaelis constant ( _K_ m) and compensation concentration for\nK [+] uptake ( _C_ min), and a higher maximum K [+] uptake rate\n( _I_ max) from K high-efficiency genotypes, compared with K\nlow-efficiency genotypes. Lower _K_ m and _C_ min indicate higher\naffinity between the roots and K [+] and stronger ability to use\n\n\n\nthe low-concentration K [+], while higher _I_ max ensures a faster\nK uptake rate (Glass, 1980; Teo et al., 1992). The absorption\nkinetic parameters of ion uptake are useful indexes of the level\nof adaptation of the genotype to the nutrient condition in the\nsoil (Crowley, 1975; Daniel et al., 2020). The study of Hao et al.\n(2015) also recognized that K kinetic parameters could be used to\ntest crop low-K adaptability. Therefore, it was reasonable to say\nthat K high-efficiency genotypes had better K adaptability than\nK low-efficiency genotypes. On the other hand, root activity is\nanother important heritable trait in evaluating root absorption\nability, which also influences nutrients acquisition and initial\ncanopy cover and, thereby, crop yields (Liu et al., 2015; Cui\net al., 2016; White et al., 2018). In the present study, both root\nvigor and absorbing activity (including actively absorbing area,\ntotal absorbing area, and the ratio of actively absorbing area to\ntotal absorbing area) were consistently enhanced by low K stress\nin K high-efficiency genotypes, while those of K low-efficiency\ngenotypes are inhibited. This kind of difference can be regulated\nby plant phytohormones (Yang, 2011), which were controlled by\nspecific genes and pathways (Liu et al., 2020). Therefore, K highefficiency genotypes are more adapted to low K stress through\nregulating root K affinity drivers, which is beneficial for the\nupward flux of nutrients (Liu et al., 2015).\nPhotosynthetic parameters affected by K levels are direct\nreferences to characterize the photosynthetic capacity of\ncrops (Wang Y. et al., 2020). Hence, it is important to\nexamine the photosynthetic characteristics of vegetable\nsoybean with different K efficiency types. In the present\nstudy, photosynthetic parameters are less affected by low K\nin K high-efficiency genotypes. The _Pn_ of K high-efficiency\ngenotypes decreased by 6.1\u20136.9% and K low-efficiency\ngenotypes by 10.9\u201315.7%. Many investigations also indicate\nthat crops with high K efficiency should be more efficient in\nphotosynthesis or that photosynthetic capacity is less affected\nby low K stress (Wang et al., 2014). For instance, under K\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 8 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\nFIGURE 5 | Schematic diagram demonstrating efficient K absorption and photosynthetic assimilation in K high-efficiency vegetable soybean under low K condition.\n\n\n\ndeficiency, _Pn_ of K-efficient cotton cultivar Liaomian 18 is\n19.4% higher than that of K-inefficient cultivar NuCOTN99 [B] .\nBesides, photosynthetic parameters of Liaomian 18 were less\naffected by low K stress (Wang N. et al., 2012). However,\nthe present study did not find absolute superiority of _Pn_\nin K high-efficiency genotypes, but they have a higher\nHI and KHI [the relevant results have been published by\nLiu et al. (2019b)]. A high HI is fundamental to efficient\nutilization of all resources taken up by the plant, and\nthe photosynthate transport and distribution rather than\nphotosynthesis rate are critical for low K adaptation in\nK high-efficiency genotypes (Rengel and Damon, 2008;\nHao et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nConsistent with photosynthetic parameters, Chl content also\nreflects the photosynthetic activity in leaves (Szafra\u00b4nska et al.,\n2017; Choudhury et al., 2019). In the present study, K highefficiency vegetable soybean genotypes exhibit lower total Chl\ncontent but greater Chl a/b ratio when suffering low K stress.\nThe effect of photosynthetic photon flux density on the leaf Chl\na/b ratio is one of the most characteristic differences between\nsun and shade leaves (Abtahi et al., 2019). Typically, total Chl\ncontent per unit leaf area is lower and the Chl a/b ratio is\ngreater in sun compared with shade soybean leaves (Anderson,\n1986; Fritschi and Ray, 2007). The higher Chl a/b ratio with\nenhanced relative content of Chl a in response to low K stress\nmight be an adapted mechanism for K high-efficiency genotypes\n\n\n\n[Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science) 9 [October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 732164](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#articles)\n\n\nLiu et al. Potassium High-Efficiency in Vegetable Soybean\n\n\n\nto maintain photosynthetic capacity because Chl a is the main\npigment in leaves that absorbs light energy, which ensures\nlight absorption as much as possible (Abtahi et al., 2019).\nSimilar results were also revealed in the research of Wang et al.\n(2008). Besides, low K stress decreased leaf K [+] concentration\nof vegetable soybean, but K high-efficiency genotypes were\nless affected (Liu et al., 2019a). This could be an important\ninternal factor affecting the chlorophyll regulation ability of K\nhigh-efficiency vegetable soybean. The present study recognized\nthat the high efficiency of photosynthesis, including more\nadaptable photosynthetic parameters and Chl proportion, was\nessential for K utilization efficiency in K high-efficiency vegetable\nsoybean genotypes.\nIt is root uptake power that drives up nutrients transport,\nwhile photosynthetic capacity and assimilate redistribution\ncapacity are the key to crop yield (He et al., 2019). In the present\nstudy, K high-efficiency vegetable soybean was found to have\nobvious advantages in root K affinity drivers, which ensured the\nupward supply of K and other nutrients. Thus, the photosynthetic\nsystem of K high-efficiency genotypes was less susceptible to low\nK conditions and has a stronger regulation ability, ensuring the\nefficiency of K utilization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe higher affinity of root to K [+] associated with root activity\nunder low K stress is essential to promote root K absorption.\nThe strong drivers, represented with higher root bleeding-sap\nrate and Tr induced by low K stress, ensure the upward flux\nof K [+] and other essential nutrients as much as possible.

The difference in soil potassium deficits between the rice\u2013rapeseed and wheat\u2013maize rotations\nwas not significant, at _\u2212_ 46.79 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] and _\u2212_ 44.07 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1], respectively, and only\nthe rice\u2013wheat rotation showed a potassium surplus. Due to the low potassium absorption of crops,\nthe equilibrium value of soil potassium is higher than that of crop rotation, and rice and wheat can\nachieve different degrees of potassium surplus. Rapeseed planting was generally under-applied\nwith potassium, and the potassium deficit could reach _\u2212_ 70 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] . (3) Climate, topography,\nanthropogenic activity, and soil available potassium explained 20.8% of the variance in soil potassium\nbalance. Anthropogenic activity such as roads and population density had the greatest influence,\nwith 0.797. Topography and average annual precipitation had the weakest influences. These findings\nemphasize the importance of anthropogenic activity for soil potassium balance, and also provide\nregional evidence for formulating efficient measures for regional potassium resources management.\n\n\n**Keywords:** crop planting structure; soil available potassium; spatial distribution; potassium balance\n\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\n\nHilly landscapes, as one of the five major terrestrial geomorphological types globally,\nplay a critical role in agricultural production. Soil nutrient management in hilly areas\nbecomes particularly crucial because hilly agriculture is susceptible to soil fertility imbalances. Exploring the characteristics of fertility balance and its influencing mechanisms is\nimportant for scientific management of hilly agriculture. Potassium (K) plays an important\nrole in plant growth, and its deficiency or absence has a significant impact on normal\nplant growth and development, cellular metabolism, and resistance to insect pests [ 1, 2 ].\nAlthough potassium is one of the most abundant nutrients in soil, soil potassium distribution shows strong spatial heterogeneity due to the high spatial and temporal variability\nin soil resources [ 3 \u2013 5 ]. Fertilization is the most direct and effective way to augment and\nregulate soil potassium content [ 6 \u2013 8 ]. However, differences in nutrient inputs, climatic\nand soil conditions, different crop assortment, and yield level all affect crop demand for\n\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_ [, 15348. https://doi.org/10.3390/su152115348](https://doi.org/10.3390/su152115348) [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability)\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 2 of 16\n\n\npotassium and its soil outflow, both of which ultimately affect the potassium balance [ 9 ].\nTherefore, understanding the soil potassium balance in a soil\u2013crop system is a priority when\nattempting to ensure a stable and high yield of crops and achieve efficient management of\npotassium resources.\nSoil potassium balance is a measure of the sum of potassium inflows and outflows\nwithin a particular framework [ 10, 11 ]. Currently, there are two main types of research\non potassium balance in farmland soil both domestically and internationally: soil potassium balance based on crop soil fertilization experiments, and soil potassium balance\nestimation based on statistical or survey data. For instance, based on a field study,\nLi et al. [ 12 ] demonstrated that zeolite amendments alleviated negative potassium balances, and Zhang et al. [ 13 ] found that high straw return with fertilization improved soil\npotassium supply and potassium balance, compared to no fertilization or low straw return\nconditions. These studies provide practical ways to improve potassium balance, but do not\nreveal the statuses of regional potassium balances. In contrast, Linquist et al. [ 14 ] assessed\nsoil potassium balance (average value was _\u2212_ 15 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] ) in commercial rice fields\nacross California based on historical information provided by growers, and Liu et al. [ 15 ]\nanalyzed temporal and spatial changes in the potassium balance of farmland in China\nfrom 1980 to 2015 using statistical data and related parameters. Although previous studies\nhave obtained the total provincial soil potassium balance, which is of some significance\nin guiding regional fertilization, they did not take into account the spatial variation in\nsoil potassium balance within a region due to crop distribution. Previous research on soil\npotassium spatial characteristics has mainly focused on spatial variation in soil potassium\nfertility and analysis of influencing factors [ 3, 4, 12 ], but has paid less attention to the spatial mapping of soil potassium balance in terms of regional crop distribution. However,\nwhen assessing the nutrient balance of the farmland in a region, the spatial distribution\nof regional crops can often better represent the regional farmland\u2019s nutrient balance and\nshows the regional farmland\u2019s nutrient surplus and deficit situation in a more realistic way.\nTherefore, considering the fact that planting structure has an important effect on potassium distribution but few studies have quantified it, especially in hilly areas where soil\nfertility exchanges are more frequent, this study attempted to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of soil potassium balance under different cropping conditions in a hilly\nregion. Shehong County, Suining City, located in the core hilly area of Sichuan Province,\npossessing typical hilly agriculture, was selected as the study area. Multi-temporal Sentinel2 satellite images and the decision-tree classification method were used to extract the spatial\ndistribution of major crops in the study area. The spatial distribution pattern for soil potassium content was also assessed using soil sampling data. The spatial distribution pattern\nof soil potassium content was evaluated through soil sampling data, and further combined\nwith the spatial distribution of regional crops. Based on a consideration of different forms\nof soil potassium input and soil potassium output, the potassium balance characteristics of\nfarmland soil in the study area were calculated, and their spatial distribution differences\nand influencing factors were analyzed, in order to provide references for rational potassium\nfertilizer application and improving soil potassium utilization efficiency in the region.\n\n\n**2. Materials and Methods**\n\n_2.1. Study Area_\n\n\nDue to the diverse planting structure and complex terrain conditions in hilly areas,\nthe management of soil potassium in these areas is often difficult. Therefore, the study\nof potassium balance in hilly areas is particularly important. This study was conducted\nin Shehong County, Sichuan Province, China, which is dominated by hilly terrain and\nlies between 105 _[\u25e6]_ 10 _[\u2032]_ E\u2013105 _[\u25e6]_ 40 _[\u2032]_ E and 30 _[\u25e6]_ 37 _[\u2032]_ N\u201331 _[\u25e6]_ 12 _[\u2032]_ N (Figure 1). The altitude within\nthe territory ranges from 280 m to 664 m, and is high in the northwest and low in the\nsoutheast. This area belongs to the subtropical humid climate zone and has a mild climate.\nThe county covers 1496 km [2] and is a rich agricultural resource. Its total arable land area is\n70,060.87 hm [2] . According to China Soil System Classification (1995), the main soil-forming\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 3 of 16\n\n\nparent materials in this region are the Penglai Group soils and three gray-brown alluviumcovered soil types (purplish soils, paddy soils, and alluvial soils), and the main crop types\nare rice, corn, wheat, and rape.\n\n\n**Figure 1.** The location of the study area in Sichuan Province.\n\n\n_2.2. Soil Sample Collection and Laboratory Analysis_\n\n\nPotential sampling points were first identified indoors based on soil type, soil-forming\nparent material, and topographic factors. Then, based on reachability and the actual state\nof the sampling sites, 56 sampling points were identified (Figure 2). A global positioning\nsystem device was used to measure geographic coordinates and elevation at each location. Crop cultivation and other information for each site was also collected during field\ninvestigation. Three soil cores were randomly collected from each site using a standard\nEdelman auger with a diameter of 7 cm, and each soil sample weighed approximately\n1 kg. The samples were air-dried, after thorough homogenization and removal of roots and\nstone, and finely ground to pass through a sieve with openings smaller than 2 mm. Soil\nrapidly available potassium (RAK) was leached with 1.0 mol L _[\u2212]_ [1] neutral NH 4 OAC at a 10:1\nwater\u2013soil ratio and slowly available potassium (SAK) was leached with 1 mol L _[\u2212]_ [1] boiling\nHNO 3 at a 10:1 water\u2013soil ratio. The filtrate of soil sample solution was measured using\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 4 of 16\n\n\nthe flame photometric method [ 16 ]. Soil available potassium (AK) was the summation of\nRAK and SAK.\n\ni\n\n\n\n**Figure 2.** Study area: basic geographic information, and location of the soil sampling sites.\n\n\n_2.3. Cropping Pattern Extraction_\n\n\nMany sophisticated supervised classification algorithms have been developed to identify crop types with multiple vegetation indices [ 17 ]. Among them, the decision tree method\nis widely used to identify crop planting structure due to its high computational efficiency\nand strong regional applicability. Therefore, a decision tree classification process was\ndesigned to achieve a simple, fast, and accurate extraction of crop patterns (Figure 3). First,\nthe cloud-free Sentinel-2 L1C images from May 2018 to April 2019 were reprocessed using\nradiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and resampling. The normalized difference\nvegetation index (NDVI) and modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI), which\nare based on the phonological differences among rice, maize, wheat, and oilseed rape, were\nused to classify the croplands. The crop samples were constructed by combining visual\ninterpretations of the images with field investigation.

Calculation of On-Farm Potassium Balance_\n\n\nThe input of farmland potassium includes: (1) Chemical fertilizer application: the\nsurvey data, provided by the County Agricultural Bureau, the Statistics Bureau, visiting\nfarmers, etc. The amount of field fertilizer application collected in this study is the compound fertilizer application amount, which does not include nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus\nfertilizer, etc., and has been converted into the input amount of potassium fertilizer (K 2 O).\nDue to the organic fertilizer input from livestock and poultry manure and the fertilizer\nrange of the main grain crops in the study area being small, in this study, the input of\norganic manure from livestock and poultry manure for main grain crops was measured\nas 0; (2) Potassium amount brought into farmland by rainfall: the average value was\nobtained via reference literature. The annual averages for potassium in rice\u2013rape, rice\u2013\nwheat, single-season rice, and the other planting systems were 15.1 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 18 ],\n13.3 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 18 ], 6.5 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 18 ], and 8.3 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 19 ], respectively.\n(3) The amount of potassium deriving from irrigation water. The total potassium input was\ndetermined according to the total amount of irrigation water and the potassium content\nof the irrigation water. The potassium amount in rice\u2013rape, rice\u2013wheat and single-season\nrice through irrigation water was calculated as 23.25 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 18 ], 17.6 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nyr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 18 ], 17.8 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 18 ], respectively, and 14.8 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 19 ] under other\nplanting systems; (4) Soil potassium deriving from returning crop straw to the field: the\nrate of returning crop straw to the field in the study area was 48.8% [ 20 ] and the potassium\nnutrient content of the straw was 1.9%, 0.99%, 1.16%, and 2.01% [ 21 ] for rice, maize, wheat,\nand oilseed rape, respectively.\nWithout considering the loss of fertilizer, the potassium outputs from a farm consist\nof the amount of leaching and the amount of potassium uptake required for the desired\neconomic yield of the crop. In this study, the loss of soil potassium was mainly caused in\npaddy fields, so the amount of leaching was considered to be 10 kg ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 19 ] and\npotassium uptake by a crop was calculated using Equation (1):\n\n\n_n_\n### K = \u2211 Y \u2217 AKi / Si (1)\n\n_i_ = 1\n\n\nwhere _K_ is the potassium nutrient content (K 2 O) per unit area of crop uptake, kg hm _[\u2212]_ [2] ; _i_ is\nthe value when the crop is present; _Y_ is the economic yield for a crop, and _AK_ is the amount\nof potassium nutrients required per unit economic yield of various crops. In this study, the\namount of potassium nutrients required per unit economic yield of rice, wheat, maize, and\nrape production were 26.3 kg t _[\u2212]_ [1], 24.7 kg t _[\u2212]_ [1], 21.6 kg t _[\u2212]_ [1], and 58.1 kg t _[\u2212]_ [1], respectively. _Si_\nis the sown area of each crop, which was obtained from the statistical yearbook.\nSoil potassium balance is the difference between soil potassium input and soil potassium output, i.e., soil potassium balance = potassium input\u2014potassium output.\n\n\n_2.5. Spatial Analysis of Potassium Balance Based on Ordinary Kriging_\n\n\nOrdinary kriging is a linear geostationary method that produces a good interpolation when the soil dataset is normally distributed and meets the second-order smooth\nassumption or quasi-second-order smooth assumption. In this study, a normality test, a\nglobal trend test, and a spatial autocorrelation test were performed using ArcGIS10.6 (Esri,\nRedlands, CA, USA) to remove outliers and trend effects. Ordinary kriging interpolation\nwas then performed for RAK and SAK based on the parameters from the best fitted semivariance model. The interpolation performance was evaluated using the cross-validation\nmethod with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE).\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 6 of 16\n\n\n_2.6. The Relationships between Environmental Factors and Potassium Balance_\n2.6.1. Environmental Factors Acquisition\n\n\nThe climatic data, which consisted of mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean\nannual precipitation (MAP), were obtained from the National Meteorological Information\n[Center (http://data.cma.cn/site/index.html, accessed on 10 June 2020).](http://data.cma.cn/site/index.html)\nThe DEM data were derived from ASTER GDEM V2 global digital elevation data\n[downloaded from the Geospatial Data Cloud (http://www.gscloud.cn/, accessed on](http://www.gscloud.cn/)\n10 June 2020) with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Two topographic factors, regional slope and\nterrain relief, were extracted using the ArcGIS spatial analysis module.\nThe vector data for county-level administrative divisions, roads, and rivers were\nobtained from the National Geographic Information Resources Catalog Service System\n[(http://www.webmap.cn/, accessed on 10 June 2020) and the population density grid data](http://www.webmap.cn/)\nwere obtained from the shared service platform of the National Earth System Science Data\n[Center (http://www.geodata.cn/, accessed on 10 June 2020).](http://www.geodata.cn/)\n\n\n2.6.2. Effects of Environmental Factors on Potassium Balance\n\n\nFirstly, the area was graded to generate a 500 m _\u00d7_ 500 m grid pattern and soil potassium input, potassium output, potassium balance, and crop areas of different crop fields\nwithin the grid were determined. The environmental factors, such as MAT, MAP, elevation,\nslope, topographic relief, average road density, and average population density, were then\nextracted within the grid. Correlations between the environmental factors and potassium\nbalance were analyzed using SPSS data analysis software (IBM SPSS Statistics19, IBM,\nSomers, NY, USA). MAT and MAP were categorized as climatic factors. Elevation, slope,\nand topographic relief were categorized as topographic factors, whereas average road\ndensity and average population density were categorized as anthropogenic activity factors.\nThe structural equation model (SEM) was constructed from these potassium balance indicators using AMOS software (IBM PSAS AMOS 21, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) to predict\nthe interactions between soil potassium balance and environmental factors such as climate,\ntopography, anthropogenic activity, and AK content of the soil.\nThe SEM used several model fitness parameters to judge the reasonableness of the\nmodel. These were chi-square ( \u03c7 [2] ), degrees of freedom (df), gradient, root mean square error\nof approximation (RMSEA), and the goodness-of-fit index (GFI). The chi-square ( \u03c7 [2] ) test,\ndegrees of freedom (df), gradient index, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA),\nand goodness-of-fit index (GFI) are critical metrics in evaluating a model. Specifically,\nthe chi-square ( \u03c7 [2] ) test gauges the divergence between observed and model-predicted\ndata. A significant \u03c7 [2] value indicates that the model does not adequately represent the\nobserved data, necessitating adjustments in model structure or parameters. Degrees of\nfreedom (df) measure the model _[\u2032]_ s complexity by indicating how many parameters can\nbe freely modified. A lower df value relative to sample size suggests a simpler model,\nthereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Meanwhile, the gradient index helps assess the\ndegree of maximum likelihood optimization in the model; a smaller gradient signifies\nbetter optimization, while a larger one suggests the need for further refinement. RMSEA\nevaluates the model _[\u2032]_ s fit quality, accounting for its complexity, and assesses the closeness\nbetween the model-predicted and actual observed covariance matrices. Lower RMSEA\nvalues imply a better fit, while higher values suggest the contrary. Lastly, the GFI offers a\ncomprehensive assessment, reflecting how closely the model _[\u2032]_ s predicted covariance matrix\naligns with the observed one. A higher GFI score indicates a better model fit. Collectively,\nthese metrics serve as a multi-faceted framework for evaluating structural equation models\n(SEM), aiding in determining model plausibility, identifying areas for improvement, and\nverifying the model _[\u2032]_ s accuracy for interactions between environmental factors and soil\npotassium balance. The formulae of \u03c7 [2], RMSEA, GFI are as follows [22]:\n\n\n_\u03c7_ [2] = ( _N_ _\u2212_ 1 ) / _f_ (2)\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 7 of 16\n\n\n\n_RMSEA_ =\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n_max_ ( _\u03c7_ [2] _\u2212_ _d f_, 0 )\n\n(3)\n_d f_ ( _N_ _\u2212_ 1 )\n\n\n\n_\u03c1_\n_GFI_ =\n\n\n\n2 _\u2212_ _d f_ (4)\n\n_N_ _\u2212_ 1 ~~\ufffd~~\n\n\n\n_\u03c7_ 2 _\u2212_ _d f_\n_\u03c1_ + 2 ~~\ufffd~~ _N_ _\u2212_ 1\n\n\n\nIn the formulae: _N_, sample size; _f_, minimized discrepancy function; _df_, degrees of\nfreedom; _\u03c1_, number of observed variables. When these parameters satisfied \u03c7 [2] /df < 3,\nRMSEA < 0.08, and GFI > 0.9, then the model was considered to be reasonably fit.\n\n\n**3. Results**\n\n_3.1. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Cropping Patterns_\n\n\nThe spatial distributions of the main four crop types were extracted from the decision\ntree. The extraction accuracy for rice, maize, rape, and wheat were 89.36%, 87.16%, 87.85%,\nand 84.65%, respectively, when compared to the Statistical Yearbook. The extraction areas\nwere 9705.22 ha, 16,147.55 ha, 5443.56 ha, and 17,414.04 ha for rice, maize, rape, and\nwheat, respectively, and the maize and wheat cultivation areas were much greater than\nthose of rice and rape (Figure 4). The distributions of the rice\u2013rape rotation, rice\u2013wheat\nrotation, rape\u2013maize rotation, and wheat\u2013maize rotation areas were obtained using the\nspatially overlaid method. The rice\u2013rape rotation, rice\u2013wheat rotation, rape\u2013maize rotation,\nand wheat\u2013maize rotation areas were 896.76 ha, 1868.92 ha, 833.48 ha, and 2106.52 ha,\n~~respectively. Maize and wheat were the main cultivated crops in the study area and the~~ y\naccounted for the largest crop areas in every township.\n\n\n**Figure 4.** Distributions of the different cropping patterns.

Spatial Distribution of Soil Available Potassium_\n\n\nThe spatial distributions of soil RAK and SAK in the study area were determined by\nkriging interpolation (Figure 5). Kriging performed well in providing reliable estimates of\nspatial distributions of RAK and SAK, with MSE lower than 0.04 and RMMSE closer to 1.\nThe value of RAK content ranged from 29.37 to 122.07 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1], with an average value of\n63.63 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1], and the soil SAK content ranged from 472.31 to 772.77 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1], with an\naverage value of 649.77 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1] (Table 1). According to the fertility grading standard of\nthe second national soil census, the soil RAK content in the study area was classified as low\nlevel, and the soil SAK was generally at a low or moderate level. The spatial distribution of\nsoil RAK was generally characterized as high in the central townships and low in the north\nand south townships, similarly to the spatial distribution of soil SAK.\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 8 of 16\n\n\n**Figure 5.** Spatial distribution of soil available potassium.\n\n\n**Table 1.** Geostatistical analysis of RAK and SAK.\n\n\n\n**Soil** **Min.** **Max.** **Mean**\n**Potassium** **(mg/kg)** **(mg/kg)** **(mg/kg)**\n\n\n\n**Standard**\n\n**Deviation**\n**(mg/kg)**\n\n\n\n**Nugget**\n**Effect**\n\n**(%)**\n\n\n\n**Range**\n**RMMSE** **MSE**\n**(km)**\n\n\n\nRAK 29.37 122.07 63.63 11.90 78.18 7.28 1.04 0.04\n\nSAK 472.31 772.77 649.77 46.43 53.72 19.31 0.99 0.01\n\n\nNote: RAK means rapid available potassium; SAK means slowly available potassium; AVG means average value;\nMSE means mean standardized error; RMSSE means root mean square standardized error.\n\n\nThe nugget effects of RAK and SAK were greater than 50%, revealing strong spatial\nvariability of soil available potassium, which indicated that anthropogenic activity, such as\ncropping pattern and field fertilization, had a greater influence than natural environmental\nfactors. The nugget effect of SAK was 53.72%, which was lower than that of RAK, suggesting that SAK was less influenced by anthropogenic activity because its morphology is more\n~~stable and it includes the part that could not be directly absorbed and utilized by crops.~~\n\n\n_3.3. Spatial Distribution of Soil Potassium Balance_\n\n\nThe results for the different sources of soil potassium showed that they were significantly different under the various cropping patterns (Table 2). Specifically, under the same\ncropping pattern, the overall order for potassium input from the different sources was\nstraw return > irrigation water > rainfall input. All three sources of potassium input, i.e.,\nrainfall input, irrigation water, and straw, were highest in the rice\u2013rapeseed rotation, at\n15.10, 23.30, and 57.91 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1], respectively. However, rainfall input was lowest\nfor the rice monoculture (6.50 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] ) and irrigation water was lowest under the\nmaize monoculture, wheat monoculture, rapeseed monoculture, rapeseed\u2013maize rotation,\nand wheat\u2013maize rotation (14.80 kg K ha ~~_[\u2212]_~~ ~~[1]~~ yr ~~_[\u2212]_~~ ~~[1]~~ ). The potassium input from straw was\nlowest under the wheat monoculture (13.73 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] ).\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 9 of 16\n\n\n**Table 2.** Soil potassium inputs under different cropping patterns (kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] ).\n\n\n**Cropping Pattern** **Rainfall** **Irrigation Water** **Straw**\n\n\nRice monocrop 6.5 17.8 38.88\nMaize monocrop 8.3 14.8 15.55\nWheat monocrop 8.3 14.8 13.73\nRape monocrop 8.3 14.8 19.03\nRice\u2013rape rotation 15.1 23.3 57.91\nRice\u2013wheat rotation 13.3 17.6 52.61\n\nRape\u2013maize rotation 8.3 14.8 34.58\nWheat\u2013maize rotation 8.3 14.8 29.28\n\n\nThe total soil potassium input and the potassium inputs from each township were\n~~counted. The results showed that the annual potassium input mostly ranged from 63.83 to~~\n100 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] in the study area. There were a few areas where the annual potassium\ninput was greater than 220 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] (Figure 6a). The areas with an annual potassium\ninput of less than 100 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] were mainly located in the hilly townships at the\nedge of the study area and the areas > kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] were mainly in the central part of\nthe study area.\n\n\n**Figure 6.** Spatial distribution maps of potassium input ( **a** ), potassium output ( **b** ), and potassium\nbalance ( **c** ).\n\n\nThe data on potassium uptake by crops were obtained from the literature rather than\nfield measurements and differences between crop varieties were not considered. This\nmeant that cropping pattern was the main reason for the spatial distribution differences\nin potassium output (Figure 6b). Annual soil potassium output in the study area mostly\nranged from 100\u2013204 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] and the potassium output of each township ranged\nfrom 129.27\u2013144.33 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] .\nThe soil potassium balance for farmland ranged from _\u2212_ 187.22 to 101.81 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nyr _[\u2212]_ [1] and the largest soil potassium deficit was in the southwest of the study area. Soil\npotassium achieved balance in the northeast and was in surplus in the central part of the\nstudy area, with a maximum of 101.81 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] (Figure 6). The soil potassium\nbalance results for the different cropping patterns showed that the rapeseed\u2013maize rotation\nhad the most severe deficit at 129.50 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] (Table 3). The difference in soil\npotassium deficit between the rice\u2013rapeseed and wheat\u2013maize rotations was not significant,\nat 46.79 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] and 44.07 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1], respectively. Only the rice\u2013wheat rotation\nshowed a potassium surplus. Low potassium uptake by crops in the monoculture systems\n~~meant that the soil potassium balance was higher for the monoculture systems than for the~~\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 10 of 16\n\n\nrotation systems. The oilseed rape areas were generally deficient in potassium by around\n\u201370.12 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1], which was a higher deficit than those of the rice\u2013rapeseed and\nwheat\u2013maize rotations.\n\n\n**Table 3.** Soil potassium balances for each cropping pattern.\n\n\n**K Input** **K Output** **K Balance**\n\n**Cropping Pattern** **Per Hectare** **Per Hectare** **Per Hectare**\n\n**Total (t)** **Total (t)** **Total (t)**\n**(kg K yr** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **)** **(kg K yr** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **)** **(kg K yr** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **)**\n\n\nRice monocrop 890.30 137.92 752.66 116.60 137.65 21.32\nMaize monocrop 1163.48 88.69 1624.03 123.80 _\u2212_ 460.554 _\u2212_ 35.11\nWheat monocrop 1580.23 115.74 1366.72 100.10 213.51 15.64\nRapeseed monocrop 306.37 86.98 553.39 157.10 _\u2212_ 247.01 _\u2212_ 70.12\nRice\u2013rapeseed rotation 255.09 216.90 310.12 263.70 _\u2212_ 55.03 _\u2212_ 46.79\nRice\u2013wheat rotation 572.05 238.28 496.23 206.70 75.818 31.58\nRapeseed\u2013maize rotation 133.92 151.40 248.46 280.90 _\u2212_ 114.543 _\u2212_ 129.50\nWheat\u2013maize rotation 378.89 179.82 471.749 223.90 _\u2212_ 92.859 _\u2212_ 44.07\n\n\n_3.4.

The\nresearch area is divided grid-by-grid, with each grid serving as a sample point. Through\ncorrelation analysis of these sample points, we identified the correlation between soil\npotassium balance and various influencing factors, as shown in Table 4. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis showed that all environmental factors except MAT showed significant\nor highly significant correlations with soil potassium balance (Table 4).

Discussion**\n\n\nIn this study, both the NDVI and the MCARI were used to construct the decisiontree-based crop distribution extraction model. Rice and maize have different climatic\ncharacteristics, which means that they are well distinguished by the NDVI during their\ndifferent growth periods [ 23 ]. Wheat and oilseed rape are similar to each other due to\ntheir growth cycles, which means that it is not appropriate to use the NDVI to distinguish\nbetween them. However, wheat and rape were separated by applying MCARI thresholds,\nwhich can discern significant differences between wheat and rape during their growth\ncycles [ 24 ]. The final extraction accuracies of the four crops, i.e., rice, maize, oilseed rape,\nand wheat, were more than 85%, indicating that the decision tree constructed in this study\nperformed well [ 25 ]. The maize and wheat areas in the study area were much larger than\nthe rice and oilseed rape areas, while the extracted crop rotation area was lower, which is\nprobably due to local planting history, soil properties, and other factors [26].\nThe mean value for soil RAK in the study area was 63.63 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1] (Table 1), the mean\nsoil RAK in the Yujiang hilly area of Jiangxi is 74.00 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 27 ], and the Pearl River\nDelta hilly area value is 77.80 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 28 ], which are all below the potassium deprivation\nthreshold of 80 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 4 ]. This is mainly due to the long history of intensive cropping\nactivity in the hilly areas of China. Crops such as maize, rape, and rice have high potassium\ndemands for growth. However, potassium fertilizer inputs have been neglected for a\nlong time in the areas in which these crops are grown, and this has led to the depletion\nof potassium reserves in the soil [ 9, 29, 30 ]. SAK, an important component of the soil AK\nreserve, is dynamically converted from partially slowly available to RAK when the soil\nis deficient in RAK [ 31 ]. However, soil SAK content in the study area was generally low\nor moderate, indicating the need for exogenous supplemental potassium inputs to meet\ncrop-growth requirements. The spatial distribution of soil RAK in the study area showed\nthat it was generally at a high level in the central townships and low in the northern and\nsouthern townships, suggesting that factors such as crop cultivation, field fertilization,\nand topography may have caused intra-regional differences in potassium content. SAK\ncontent was significantly high in central and east townships and low in the north and\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 12 of 16\n\n\nsouth townships, mainly because its more stable nature is significantly influenced by\nnatural factors.\n\nIn various crop rotation systems, significant differences exist in the sources of soil\npotassium, such as straw recycling, irrigation water, and rainfall input. Taking the rice\u2013\nrapeseed rotation model as an example, all sources of potassium input are highest in this\nsystem, particularly straw recycling, which contributes up to 57.91 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1] . This\nhigh input is likely attributable to the abundant organic matter provided by straw recycling,\nthereby elevating the potassium content in the soil [ 32 ]. Specific fertilizer management\npractices may have been adopted in the rice\u2013rapeseed rotation model, as existing research\ndemonstrates that appropriate use of potassium fertilizers can increase soil potassium\nlevels [ 33 ]. Concurrently, soil types also influence potassium content and availability. For\ninstance, clay soils usually retain potassium more effectively than sandy soils, which might\nlead to potassium leaching [ 34 ]. This study found that the most severe potassium deficiency\noccurred in the rapeseed\u2013maize rotation model, while the deficiency was comparably mild\nin the rice\u2013rapeseed and wheat\u2013maize rotation models; only the rice\u2013wheat rotation model\nshowed a surplus of potassium. These variations are likely due to the differential demand\nand utilization efficiency of potassium among various crops and also depend on the stage\nof crop growth [ 35 ]. Lastly, compared to monoculture systems, crops in rotation systems\ngenerally exhibit higher demand for and utilization of potassium. In monoculture systems,\ncrops usually have lower potassium uptake, resulting in a higher soil potassium balance.\nThis, in turn, affects the overall soil potassium balance in the system [9,36].\nIn general, the higher the altitude, the lower the temperature, which is not conducive\nto the normal growth of crops such as maize, rape, and rice [ 37 ], and the greater the slope,\nthe more severe the soil erosion and the greater the labor input required [ 38, 39 ]. Thus,\nthe high altitude and slope topographic factors lead to reduced cropping activity and\ndecreased potassium export, whereas topography is significantly and positively correlated\nwith potassium balance (Figure 7). In addition, topography is one of the determinants of soil\nwater, nutrients, and temperature redistribution in certain regions [ 40, 41 ]; therefore, it also\nhas an indirect effect on potassium balance by affecting natural factors, such as MAP and\nsoil AK content. For example, Liu et al. [ 42 ] showed that precipitation on the northeastern\nslope of the Tibetan Plateau was negatively related to altitude. Furthermore, sufficient\nprecipitation can enhance crop productivity and thus potassium uptake [ 43 ], but it can\nalso increase AK leaching loss from soil [ 3, 44 ]; therefore, precipitation has a negative effect\non soil AK content and potassium balance. Anthropogenic factors influence soil AK and\npotassium balance mainly through planting intensity and fertilizer management. On the\none hand, the greater the road density, the more convenient the agricultural mechanization\noperation [ 45 ], while higher population density leads to greater food demand. Thus, high\nroad and population densities increase crop planting intensity and aggravate potassium\noutput. But, on the other hand, increased road density also promotes fertilizer management\nactivity, and potassium fertilizer applications directly increase potassium inputs and the\neffective soil potassium content. Ultimately, the results from this study show that the\ncombined effects of topography, precipitation, and anthropogenic factors led to soil AK\ncontent having a highly significant positive effect on potassium balance.\nIn the present study, topography, anthropogenic activities, precipitation, and soil\neffective potassium content explained 20.8% of the variation in potassium balance, but\n79.2% remained unexplained. This unexplained portion may be related to differences\nin soil particle composition, basic chemical properties, and mineralogical characteristics.\nSoil particles are the basic structure of the soil porous medium and their composition is\nclosely linked to the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil. Previous studies\nhave reported that fine particles (clay and powder) are the physical conservators of soil\npotassium and that the proportion of fine particles is an important factor controlling the\nvariation of soil potassium content [ 46, 47 ]. Zhuang et al. [ 48 ] pointed out that during\nseepage, fine particles migrate between large voids, leading to soil physical erosion, and the\nloss of potassium ions leads to chemical dissolution. Furthermore, soil particle composition\n\n\n_Sustainability_ **2023**, _15_, 15348 13 of 16\n\n\ncan also have an impact on crop growth [ 49 ]. For example, Huang et al. [ 50 ] showed that\nplant numbers and biomass were significantly greater in finer-grained soils. In addition, as\nimportant indicators of basic soil properties, adequate soil cation exchange, soil organic\nmatter levels, and an appropriate pH not only ensure normal plant growth, but also\ninfluence soil potassium fixation and uptake capacity through ion exchange with Al [3+], Ca [2+],\nand Mg [2+] [ 51 ]. Similarly, clay minerals can be involved in potassium balance processes\nthrough ion exchange, dissolution release, and colloidal sorption [ 9, 52, 53 ], and the effects\nof different types of minerals on soil potassium are not uniform. For instance, 2:1 clay\nminerals are generally a reservoir of potassium in the soil, but are converted to vermiculite,\nchlorite, etc., when potassium becomes depleted [ 54 ]. Therefore, the above unexplained\nfactors may have contributed to the fact that only 20.8% of variation in potassium balance\nwas fully explained in the structural equation model, and should be explored in depth in\nfuture studies.\n\n\n**5. Conclusions**\n\n\nIn this study, the spatial structure of the main crops within the study area was extracted using a decision tree algorithm based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2A imagery. The\naccuracy for crop extraction ranged from 84.65% to 89.36%, as compared to data from the\nStatistical Yearbook. The average amount of readily available potassium (RAK) in the soil\nwas 63.63 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1], while that of slowly available potassium (SAK) stood at 649.77 mg kg _[\u2212]_ [1] .\nThe spatial distribution patterns of both RAK and SAK in the soil predominantly exhibited\nhigh levels in the central townships and lower concentrations in the northern and southern\ntownships. The soil potassium balance outcomes for various cropping patterns varied\nfrom _\u2212_ 187.22 to 101.81 kg K ha _[\u2212]_ [1] yr _[\u2212]_ [1], with the rape\u2013maize rotation showing the most\nsignificant potassium deficit. Climate, topography, human activity, and soil AK together\nexplained about 20% of the variation in soil potassium balance. Unexplained variations in\nthe results are likely attributable to the omission of additional crops, such as vegetables\nand sweet potatoes. The differences in potassium input and output patterns for these\nunaccounted crops, as compared to the crops identified through remote sensing images,\nmay have had some impact on the study results. Furthermore, the unexplained variation\nmay also be attributed to the fact that the calculated potassium inputs and outputs were\nprimarily derived from pertinent literature and field surveys, without taking into account\nthe contribution of soil potassium supplementation through organic fertilizers, such as\nlivestock and poultry manure. Hence, future studies should aim to acquire more precise\ndata regarding regional cropping patterns and the specific parameters employed in potassium balance calculations. This would help to better elucidate the factors affecting soil\npotassium balance and establish a solid theoretical foundation for the precise management\nof soil potassium fertility.\n\n\n**Author Contributions:** Conceptualization, S.W. and T.L.; Methodology, S.W. and P.P.; Data Collection,\nZ.L.; Analysis and Interpretation of Results, L.L. and G.W.; Visualization, Y.X.; Draft Manuscript\nPreparation, S.W.; Funding Acquisition, Q.L.; S.W. and Z.L. contributed equally to this work and\nshould be considered co-first authors.

This has raised concerns, since updated knowledge of\nnutrient requirements at various stages of oil palm growth is essential for formulating fertilizer\nrecommendations that meet agronomic, economic, and environmental objectives. We therefore filled\nin this knowledge gap with the objective to quantify the standing biomass, dry-matter production,\nand nutrient demand of tenera oil palm of different ages, grown under current agronomic practices.\nTenera palms were sampled at 12, 29, 48, 88, 133, 209, and 238 months since nursery planting and\nseparated into spear leaves, leaflets, rachis, petiole, leaf bases, cabbage, trunk, bole, and roots attached\nto bole for determination of dry weights and nutrient contents. Fruit bunches were harvested, with\ndry weights and nutrient contents of ripe bunches determined. Annual dry-matter production\nwas calculated from dry weights of different plant parts, and together with nutrient concentrations\ndetermined in these plant parts and fruit bunches, annual nutrient demand was calculated. Excluding\nroots, the total standing vegetative biomass increased almost linearly from 1.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months\nold to 808.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old. Whole-palm dry-matter production increased with palm\nage but at a decreasing rate, from 1.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 285.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nafter 133 months, with little increase thereafter. The maximum rates of nutrient demand occurred\n\nafter 209 months, coinciding with peak production of fruit bunches\u2014except for K, which occurred at\nmonth 88 when vegetative growth demand for K peaked. Annual gross amounts of nutrients required\nto produce 25 t fresh fruit bunches ha _[\u2212]_ [1] were 1.99 kg N, 0.28 kg P, 3.94 kg K, 0.42 kg Mg, 0.99 kg Ca,\nand 2.5 g B per palm. The net amounts of nutrients required to meet similar production level of fruit\nbunches were 1.04 kg N, 0.16 kg P, 1.85 kg K, 0.26 kg Mg, 0.47 kg Ca, and 1.3 g B per palm per year\nif all nutrients contained in the pruned leaves were recycled. These results provide much-needed\nupdated data on the dry-matter production and nutrient demand of tenera oil palm grown under\ncurrent agronomic practices and also serve as a general yardstick for practitioners to further refine\n\nfertilizer recommendations.\n\n\n**Keywords:** tenera; biomass; tree parts; nutrient concentration; nutrient partitioning\n\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\n\nOil palm ( _Elaeis guineensis_ Jacq.) is the most productive edible oil-producing crop,\nwith potential to produce up to 9.5 t oil ha _[\u2212]_ [1] [ 1 ]. It requires a large amount of nutrients\nsuch as N, P, K, Mg, and Ca to maintain its high levels of standing biomass and drymatter production [ 2 \u2013 6 ]. These nutrients are typically supplied by fertilizers, since oil\npalm is predominantly grown on highly weathered tropical soils with low soil-nutrient\nreserves [ 7, 8 ]. Fertilizers are thus essential for sustaining growth of oil palm and economic\nproduction of fresh fruit bunches, which can account up to 32% of total production cost of\n\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_ [, 426. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12020426](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12020426) [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy)\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 2 of 18\n\n\nfresh fruit bunches [ 9 ]. The high operating budget for fertilizers emphasizes the importance\nof more efficient use of fertilizers to maximize profitability of palm oil production while\nreducing potential detrimental effects of inorganic fertilizers on the environment [10].\nThe amount of nutrients required by a growing oil palm encompasses the amount of\nnutrients required to meet growth demand and deficiency demand [11], where deficiency\ndemand is the amount of nutrients required to correct nutrient deficiency, which can be\ndetermined through measurements of nutrient concentrations in the leaflet and rachis\ntissues [ 12 \u2013 14 ]. Meanwhile, growth demand is the amount of nutrients required to grow\nplant tissues such as spear leaves (unopened leaves), leaves, trunk, roots, and fresh fruit\nbunches, as well as to replace any plant tissues that are removed such as fresh fruit bunches,\nleaves and roots [ 11 ]. This growth demand for nutrients can be calculated from the amount\nof dry matter incorporated in the plant tissues and its nutrient concentrations.\nA few studies have investigated the dry-matter production [ 2, 15, 16 ] and nutrient\ncontent [ 2, 17 ] in oil palm through destructive measurement of oil palms of different ages.\nThis had allowed determination of growth demand for nutrients and enabled formulation\nof the fertilizer requirement for oil palm. However, the oil palms sampled were mostly\nof the thick-shelled dura that has since been replaced by the thin-shelled tenera as the\nprimary commercial oil-palm planting material [ 11 ] because of its higher oil-yield potential\n( 9.5 t oil ha _[\u2212]_ [1] ) [1] . The higher oil-yield potential of tenera may be associated with greater\ntotal plant nutrient demand, and this nutrient demand is best determined through destructive measurements. However, this was not practiced until the work by Teoh and Chew [ 18 ]\nand Goh et al. [ 4, 5 ] who studied the N, P, and K requirements of tenera. However, they restricted their measurements to mature palms aged between 12.5 and 19 years. More recently,\na similar study was conducted on 14-year-old tenera but with limited measurements on\nthe nutrient contents of fruit bunches, trunk tissue, and roots [ 6 ]. Other studies have been\nlimited to determining the nutrient content of tenera bunches [ 19, 20 ]. In one rare study, the\nmicronutrient boron requirement of 20\u201382 month-old tenera was investigated [ 21 ]. Since\nthen, there have been no such investigations carried out to determine the nutrient demand\nof tenera of different ages.\nTherefore, it is obvious that the palm-oil industry lacks comprehensive knowledge on\nthe nutrient demand of tenera at various stages of growth. Recent advances in oil-palm\nbreeding and agronomic practices may have further influenced the uptake, partitioning, and\naccumulation of nutrients in tenera since the last comprehensive studies were conducted\non tenera three decades ago [ 4, 5 ]. As such, data collected from dura are sometimes used to\nfill this gap. This has raised concerns, since updated knowledge of nutrient requirements\nat various stages of tenera growth is essential for formulating fertilizer recommendations\nthat meet agronomic, economic, and environmental objectives [ 22 ]. Goh et al. [ 21 ] found\nthat 20-to-82-month-old tenera required about 27% more boron than dura of the same age.\nTarmizi and Mohd Tayeb [ 6 ] found that N and K contents in tenera bunches were higher\nthan those in dura bunches by 5% and 6%, respectively, but the P and Mg contents were 16%\nlower than those in dura bunches. In another study, the N, P, K, and Mg contents in tenera\nbunches were 56, 54, 44, and 14% higher than those in dura bunches, respectively [ 19 ]. All\nthese findings suggest that tenera, which has higher oil-yield potential, requires a larger\namount of nutrients to sustain its productivity. As such, fertilizer recommendations based\non older nutrient demand data might not adequately support the increased oil production.\nIt is thus imperative that we reevaluate the nutrient uptake and partitioning patterns in\ntenera at different stages of growth.\nWe aimed to fill in this knowledge gap with the objective to quantify the standing\nbiomass, dry-matter production, and nutrient demand of tenera of different ages, grown\non inland sedentary soils under the current agronomic practices in Malaysia.\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 3 of 18\n\n\n**2. Materials and Methods**\n\n_2.1. Study Site_\n\n\nThis study was carried out in an oil-palm plantation located in Layang-Layang ( 1.81 _[\u25e6]_ N\n103.45 _[\u25e6]_ E), Johor, Malaysia. The plantation has 129 oil-palm blocks with a total planted area\nof 2935 hectares. Block size varies from 5.1 to 34.8 hectares. There are 13 soil types found in\nthe plantation but Harimau Series (Typic Paleudult), which is a deep, well-drained soil with\n30% clay, 3% silt, 34% fine sand, and 29% coarse sand, dominates 56.5% of the total planted\narea [ 23 ]. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of Hariamu Series is low at 4.09 cmol kg _[\u2212]_ [1],\nwith exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg at 0.11, 0.68 and 0.18 cmol kg _[\u2212]_ [1], respectively. Harimau\nSeries soil is moderately acidic, with a pH of 4.5, 0.13% total N, and 8.2 ppm available P.\nThe topography of the study site is undulating, with slopes ranging from 2 to 6 _[\u25e6]_ . Annual\nrainfall received from 2011 to 2019 averaged ( _\u00b1_ sd) at 2522 _\u00b1_ 66 mm, with 135 _\u00b1_ 3 rain days.\nMean annual air temperature averaged at 26.5 _\u00b1_ 0.5 _[\u25e6]_ C. The study site is thus deemed\nfavorable for growing oil palm [8,24].\n\n\n_2.2. Planting Materials_\n\n\nTenera (Deli Dura _\u00d7_ AVROS Pisifera) palms were sampled. These were fertilized\ncommercial palms grown under the current Sime Darby Plantation agromanagement\npractices. These palms were sampled from different blocks, where each block is planted\nwith one specific palm age. Most blocks were initially planted with 148 palms per hectare\nbut there are some blocks planted with higher densities of 160\u2013180 palms per hectare. Based\non the developed soil map by the Sime Darby Plantation, palms planted in blocks with\nsimilar terrains and with Harimau Series as dominant soil type were selected for sampling.\nThe age of palms at time of sampling were 12, 29, 48, 88, 133, 209, and 238 months old,\ncalculated from the time of nursery planting. Four palms from each age group were\nrandomly sampled. Stunted, abnormal, and roadside palms were excluded from sampling.\nThe 88-month-old palms sampled from a high-density planting block were healthy and\nnot etiolated at the time of sampling. Fertilizers were applied on an annual basis and\nthe last three years\u2019 fertilizer quantities applied to the sampled palms prior to destructive\nsampling were averaged and are provided in Table 1. The nursery palms (12 months old)\nonly received one year of fertilizer applications while the 29-month-old palms received one\nyear of fertilizer applications after field planting. Oil palm is normally raised in the nursery\nfor 12 months before transplanting in the field.\n\n\n**Table 1.** Average fertilizer rates applied to the sampled tenera palms prior to destructive sampling.\nSPH and n.a. denote actual stands per hectare at time of sampling, and not applicable, respectively.\n\n\n**Quantity of Nutrients Applied (kg palm** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **year** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **)**\n**Palm Age** **SPH**\n**(Months)** **N** **P** **K** **Mg** **Ca** **B**\n\n\n12 n.a. 0.04 0.02 0.02 0.01 0 0\n\n29 157 0.60 0.51 0.71 0.06 0.57 0\n\n48 148 0.66 0.40 1.06 0.12 0.52 0.009\n\n88 173 0.97 0.21 1.93 0.28 0.52 0.009\n\n133 150 0.89 0.24 1.91 0.26 0.72 0.009\n\n209 133 0.89 0.22 1.99 0.26 0.70 0.009\n\n238 134 0.85 0.21 1.85 0.23 0.63 0.009\n\n\n_2.3. Destructive Sampling_\n\n\nThe tenera palms selected for destructive sampling were harvested, uprooted, and\nseparated into different morphological components viz. leaves (further divided into leaflets,\nrachis, and petiole), leaf bases, spear leaves, cabbage, trunk, bole, roots, male and female\ninflorescences, and bunches [ 2, 18 ]. Figure 1 briefly illustrates the sampling of various\nparts of the oil palm. Root biomass may contain significant amounts of nutrients, but no\nmeasurement was made in this study.\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 4 of 18\n\n\n**Figure 1.** Destructive sampling of the tenera oil palm.

Left\u2014ripe bunch; middle and right\u2014unripe bunches.\n\n\n2.3.1. Leaves\n\n\nEach leaf was removed individually and divided into leaflets, rachis, and petiole.\nLeaflets were sampled systematically by sampling one leaflet for every ten leaflets until\nthe tip of the rachis for both sides of a leaf. These leaflets were then bulked, weighed,\nand treated separately for nutrient analysis. All remainder leaflets were cut off, bulked,\nweighed, and dried. Each of the rachis and petiole was cut into six and four equal parts\nrespectively, bulked and weighed. A 10-cm long subsample was cut from the middle of\neach part, bulked, weighed, dried and used for nutrient analysis. \u2018Spear leaves\u2019 (unopened\nleaves) were cut off from the crown after felling the sampled palm, numbered and cut into\nsix parts of equal length, bulked and weighed. A 10 cm long subsample was cut from the\nmiddle of each part, bulked, weighed, dried and used for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.2. Trunk\n\n\nAfter the removal of all leaves, the whole trunk was uprooted with the bole. The\nbole was separated from the trunk, then the trunk was further separated into upper and\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 5 of 18\n\n\nlower trunk parts, because the tissues of both trunk sections contain contrasting nutrient\nconcentrations [ 2 ]. The upper trunk, which supports the leaves, is defined as the section\nfrom the base of Leaf\u201341 to the base of Leaf\u20131 (Figure 1a). The upper trunk was cut into\nthree equal sections, and each section was weighed separately. A 15-cm thick subsection\nwas cut from the middle of each trunk section and weighed. Each trunk subsection was\nfurther cut into eight equal parts, and two one-eighth parts were taken randomly. These\nsubsamples were bulked separately, weighed, and used for nutrient analysis. The lower\ntrunk, which forms the major portion of palm trunk is defined as the section between the\nbase of Leaf\u201341 and the trunk base where the bole was separated (Figure 1b). The lower\ntrunk was then cut into three equal sections and treated in the same way as the upper trunk.\n\n\n2.3.3. Cabbage\n\n\nThe cabbage is the succulent tissue found at the apex of the upper trunk, which is\nbasically comprised of a soft mass of immature leaves and inflorescences that contain much\nhigher concentrations of nutrients. It was treated separately. The cabbage was cut out,\nchopped, dried, weighed, and taken for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.4. Bole\n\n\nThe bole was separated from the trunk, and soils attached to the bole and the roots\nwere removed by spraying with water. Roots attached to the bole were removed with\na sharp knife. The bole was weighed and then cut into eight longitudinal sections of\napproximate size. Two one-eighth sections were weighed and taken for nutrient analysis.\nAll roots removed from the bole were bulked and weighed, and about 2 kg of each of the\nroots was taken for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.5. Leaf Bases\n\n\nAll leaf bases attached to each section of upper and lower trunk were removed, bulked,\nand weighed. Two pieces of leaf bases from each section were randomly sampled, weighed\nand used for nutrient analysis.\n\n\n2.3.6. Fresh Fruit Bunches\n\n\nAll fruit bunches were harvested before palm felling and were separated into ripe\nand unripe bunches. Each bunch was weighed in the field and immediately taken to the\nlaboratory where each bunch was treated separately [ 6 ]. In the laboratory, every bunch\nwas stripped and separated into fruits, stalks, and spikelets with trash and weighed. All\nof the fruits were cleaned and separated, firstly into pericarp and nut, and were again\nweighed individually. The stalk, spikelet, and pericarp were diced. A maximum of 2 kg of\nsubsamples from stalk, spikelet, and pericarp component were dried overnight at 70 _[\u25e6]_ C\nbefore grinding in a mill. The nut was dried similarly and then cracked with a hammer to\nextract the kernel. After separation, the shell was placed in a canvas bag and crushed with\na hammer before grinding in a mill. The kernel was pounded up in a porcelain mortar. The\nground material was then quartered for a subsample of about 250 g. The stalk was cleaned\nand treated in the same way as the spikelet/trash.\n\n\n_2.4. Laboratory Analysis_\n\n\nAll palm organs were wiped clean with distilled water before they were cut into\nsmaller pieces and dried to a constant weight between 50 to 70 _[\u25e6]_ C using a Memmert\nlaboratory oven Model UF450 (Memmert GmbH, Schwabach, Germany). Total N in the\norgan samples was determined using the combustion method with an elemental analyzer\nwith temperature set at 900 _[\u25e6]_ C [ 25 ]; P was determined colorimetrically by the yellow\nphosphovanadate complex using the AutoAnalyzer after dry-ashing [ 26 ]; K, Mg, and Ca by\nthe Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer after dry-ashing [ 27 ]; and B by the Azomethine\nmethod using a UV Spectrophotometer after dry-ashing with H 2 SO 4 [28].\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 6 of 18\n\n\n_2.5. Data Analysis_\n2.5.1. Determination of Dry Weight\n\n\nTotal dry weight of a specific palm tissue, DW x (where x represents a specific tree part,\nsuch as spear leaves, leaflets, rachis, petiole, leaf bases, cabbage, trunk, or bole) for each\npalm age was determined as:\n\nDW x = W 0 _\u00d7_ [W] [2] (1)\n\nW 1\n\n\nwhere W 0 is the total fresh weight of a specific palm tissue, and W 1 and W 2 is the subsample fresh weight and dry weight of a specific palm tissue, respectively. All weights are\nin kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n\n\n2.5.2. Estimation of Dry-Matter Production\n\n\nDry weights determined for each replicate of spear leaves, trunk, and bole at months 12,\n29, 48, 88, 133, 209, and 238 were treated individually and subjected to nonlinear regression\nanalysis using TableCurve 2D version 5.1 (SYSTAT Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA, 2002)\nto estimate annual dry matter incorporated in spear leaves (DM spear ), trunk (DM trunk ),\nand bole (DM bole ). Models generated from the curve-fitting software were examined.\nParsimonious models with low fitting standard error and high R [2] were selected [ 29 ]. From\nthe fitted curves, monthly DM spear, DM trunk, and DM bole were then calculated and summed\nto give annual dry-matter production in kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] . Trunk dry matter includes\nthe cabbage and the upper and lower trunk. Annual leaf dry-matter production (DM leaf ;\nkg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ) was calculated following Corley et al. [16] as:\n\n\n\nDW leaf\nDM leaf =\n\ufffd FN\n\n\n\n_\u00d7_ FPR (2)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nwhere DW leaf is the total dry weight of leaves (kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] ) at the time of sampling, FN\nis the total number of leaves per palm at the time of sampling, and FPR is the 12-month\nperiod\u2019s total leaf numbers produced for the year preceding the destructive sampling\n( no. palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ). The number of leaves produced by the sampled palms was estimated\nfrom Equation (3), which was derived from three oil-palm planting-density trials carried\nout under the Malaysian inland environment (see Supplementary Figure S1), which is\nsimilar to the environment of this study [ 30 ]. The number of leaves produced in a month\nfor a given palm age was estimated as:\n\n\nFPR month = 2.9645 exp ( _\u2212_ age/380.6418 ) (3)\n\n\nwhere age is the palm age in months since nursery planting. Annual root dry-matter\nproduction (DM root ; kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ) was derived from the aboveground vegetative\ndry-matter production (VDM) estimated in this study as:\n\n\nDM root = VDM _\u00d7_ 0.104 (4)\n\n\nwhere 0.104 is the mean root-to-shoot ratio, calculated from Henson and Chai [ 31 ]. The\ndry weight of fresh fruit bunches (DM FFB ) in kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] for the year preceding\ndestructive sampling was calculated as:\n\n\n\nY FFB\nDM FFB =\n\ufffd SPH\n\n\n\n_\u00d7_ 0.5275 (5)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nwhere Y FFB is the 12-month period\u2019s total weight of fresh fruit bunches (kg ha _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ),\nSPH is the number of palms per hectare for the block from which the sampled palms were\ntaken, and 0.5275 is a constant used for converting the weight of fresh fruit bunches to the\ndry weight [32].\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 7 of 18\n\n\n2.5.3. Estimation of Nutrient Demand\n\n\nThe annual quantity of nutrient required to grow and maintain each palm organ (N _x_ ;\nkg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] ) for each palm age was calculated as:\n\n\nN _x_ = DM _x_ _\u00d7_ C _x_ (6)\n\n\nwhere DM _x_ is the amount of dry matter incorporated in a specific palm organ over a year,\nand where _x_ represents bunches, spear leaves, leaves, trunk, bole, or roots. C _x_ (% dry\nmatter) is the concentration of a nutrient element for a specific palm organ, _x_ . The annual\nnutrient demand calculated for each vegetative organ was summed to give the annual\nnutrient demand for vegetative growth. The sum of nutrient demand for vegetative growth\nand bunch production gives the total nutrient demand.\n\n\n2.5.4. Statistical Analysis\n\n\nDry weight and dry-matter production data, and nutrient concentrations data collected\nfrom vegetative tissues and components of fruit bunches were analyzed using JMP [\u00ae] Version\n14 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, 2021). The growth stages of tenera were divided into\nnursery (12 months old), immature (29\u201348 months old), and mature ( 88\u2013238 months old ).\nMeans were separated by the Tukey HSD test procedure at the threshold significant level\nof 5%. Pearson correlations between tissues\u2019 nutrient concentrations with palm age in\n12-to-238-month-old tenera were analyzed using JMP [\u00ae] Version 14 (SAS Institute Inc.,\nCary, NC, USA, 2021).\n\n\n**3. Results**\n\n_3.1. Vegetative Biomass and Its Distribution_\n\nTotal vegetative biomass increased almost linearly from 1.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months\nold to 808.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old (Table 2). Trunk biomass alone increased from\n1.1 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 29 months after planting to 430.8 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old, while leaf\nbiomass, which is comprised of leaflets, rachis, and petiole increased from 1.0 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at\n12 months after planting to 223.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] after 133 months, with little increase thereafter.\nThe biomass of leaf bases increased substantially from 11.4 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 48 months old\nto 105.7 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 133 months old before declining to 90.4 and 59.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at\n209 and 238 months old, respectively. The bole was taken as the only belowground vegetative biomass in this study, while roots attached to the bole were excluded. Bole biomass\nincreased from 0.24 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 58.7 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] after 238 months of planting.\n\n\n**Table 2.** Dry weights (mean _\u00b1_ SE) of standing vegetative biomass of tenera oil palm sampled in Malaysia.\n\n\n\n**Palm**\n**Age ***\n\n\n\n**Vegetative Biomass (kg palm** _[\u2212]_ **[1]** **)**\n\n\n**Leaflets** **Rachis** **Petiole** **Leaves** **Spear Leaves** - **Trunk** **Leaf Bases** **Bole** **Total**\n\n\n\n12 0.37 _\u00b1_ 0.05 e 0.24 _\u00b1_ 0.03 c 0.4 _\u00b1_ 0.1 c 1.0 _\u00b1_ 0.1 d 0.045 _\u00b1_ 0.005 d \u2013 \u2013 0.24 _\u00b1_ 0.01 c 1.3 _\u00b1_ 0.1 f\n\n29 3.2 _\u00b1_ 0.1 e 2.0 _\u00b1_ 0.1 c 5.1 _\u00b1_ 0.5 c 10.2 _\u00b1_ 0.7 d 0.35 _\u00b1_ 0.04 d 1.1 _\u00b1_ 0.1 e \u2013 0.57 _\u00b1_ 0.02 c 12.3 _\u00b1_ 0.7 f\n\n48 26.8 _\u00b1_ 0.2 d 21.1 _\u00b1_ 0.8 c 38.6 _\u00b1_ 1.9 b 87.6 _\u00b1_ 0.7 c 3.2 _\u00b1_ 0.1 cd 30.1 _\u00b1_ 0.2 de 11.4 _\u00b1_ 0.3 c 2.0 _\u00b1_ 0.04 c 134.0 _\u00b1_ 0.6 e\n\n88 49.4 _\u00b1_ 3.3 c 49.6 _\u00b1_ 5.6 b 54.0 _\u00b1_ 6.2 b 153.0 _\u00b1_ 14.8 b 6.0 _\u00b1_ 1.0 bcd 85.1 _\u00b1_ 4.8 d 72.7 _\u00b1_ 3.1 b 10.1 _\u00b1_ 1.1 bc 326.9 _\u00b1_ 16.9 d\n\n133 61.9 _\u00b1_ 2.3 b 75.5 _\u00b1_ 11.9 a 86.0 _\u00b1_ 8.9 a 223.3 _\u00b1_ 22.5 a 11.3 _\u00b1_ 1.5 ab 216.8 _\u00b1_ 7.7 c 105.7 _\u00b1_ 11.1 a 20.7 _\u00b1_ 2.5 b 577.9 _\u00b1_ 29.3 c\n\n209 72.7 _\u00b1_ 1.4 a 70.8 _\u00b1_ 1.5 ab 92.1 _\u00b1_ 4.7 a 235.5 _\u00b1_ 6.6 a 8.8 _\u00b1_ 0.6 abc 308.9 _\u00b1_ 3.0 b 90.4 _\u00b1_ 2.0 ab 21.1 _\u00b1_ 1.2 b 664.7 _\u00b1_ 7.5 b\n\n238 68.8 _\u00b1_ 3.5 ab 90.2 _\u00b1_ 6.4 a 87.3 _\u00b1_ 7.4 a 246.2 _\u00b1_ 12.4 a 13.3 _\u00b1_ 2.9 a 430.8 _\u00b1_ 34.3 a 59.6 _\u00b1_ 11.1 b 58.7 _\u00b1_ 7.0 a 808.6 _\u00b1_ 34.3 a\n\n\n                  - Months since nursery planting.

Estimation of Dry-Matter Production_\n\n\nCumulative dry matter incorporated in tree parts was estimated through nonlinear\nregression (Table 3). The cumulative dry weights for spear leaves, trunk, and bole fitted well\nto modified exponential models. This method was highly satisfactory and gave accurate\nestimate of dry-matter production as R [2] of all the equations determined for most of the\nreplicates exceeded 0.90. Lower R [2] found in replicate 4 of DW spear and all replicates of\nDW bole was caused by outliers.\n\n\n**Table 3.** Equations to calculate the cumulative dry matter incorporated in spear leaves, trunk, and\nbole of tenera oil palm.

Dry-Matter Production_\n\n\nWhole-palm dry-matter production increased with palm age but at a decreasing rate\n(Table 4). This was mainly attributed to the increasing amount of dry matter incorporated\nin vegetative tissue and fruit bunches during the first 133 months of growth. However, as\nthe amount of dry matter incorporated in leaves, trunk, roots, and fruit bunches started\nto stabilize at about 133 months onwards, the rate of whole-palm dry-matter production\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 9 of 18\n\n\ndecreased.

Nutrients in Vegetative Tissues_\n\n\nThe concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B in the vegetative tissues of nursery,\nimmature and mature tenera palms are summarized in Table 5, while concentrations of\nthese nutrients in vegetative tissues for each palm age are provided in Tables S1 and S2. In\ngeneral, the concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B in vegetative tissues varied depending\non type of tissues, palm age, and nutrient elements. Nutrient concentrations between palms\nvaried considerably depending on palm age, nutrient element, and tissue types. For a\nwhole palm, the coefficient of variation for N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B concentrations could\nvary between 5.7 and 20.7%, 9.1 and 27.3%, 8.2 and 33.5%, 5.0 and 16.1%, 2.9 and 20.9%,\nand 2.8 and 19.2%, respectively.\nAmong the vegetative tissues, the cabbage, which comprises mainly meristemic cells,\nhad the highest concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B, while roots in general had\nthe lowest concentrations of these nutrients. The leaflets, which serve as photosynthetic\norgan had the second highest N concentration. The trunk, which is a storage organ, had\nhigher concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca after the cabbage and leaflets, except for Mg\nconcentration in the trunk of mature palms. Leaf bases, which are parts of the petiole that are\nattached to the trunk, had comparable concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca to the petiole.\nAveraged over the whole palm, the concentrations of N and Mg of 12-month-old\nnursery tenera were lower than in tenera of the same age studied previously (Table 6), but\nP concentration was comparable, and K and Ca concentrations were higher. For the whole\nimmature tenera, the concentrations of N and Mg were comparable to tenera studied by\nNg et al. [ 2 ] but P, K, and Ca concentrations were higher (Table 6). The concentrations of N,\nP, K, and Ca of mature tenera studied here were higher than previously studied dura and\ntenera except for Mg in mature dura (Table 6).\nK concentration in the leaves, trunk, and the whole palm did not change with palm age\nwhile concentrations of N, P, and Mg decreased with age (Table 7). On the other hand, Ca and\nB concentrations decreased with age in the trunk and the whole palm but not in the leaves.\n\n\n_3.5. Nutrients in Fresh Fruit Bunches_\n\n\nThe nutrient concentrations in fresh fruit bunches and their components are given in\nTable 8 .

Nutrient Demand_\n\n\nThe annual demand of N, P, Mg, Ca, and B for vegetative growth tended to follow\nannual vegetative dry-matter production (Figure 3; Table 4), with low demand during the\nfirst 12 months of growth. However, thereafter, nutrient demand increased rapidly up to\n88 months after nursery planting, and with slower increase thereafter up to month 209,\nbefore declining to a lower demand at month 238. Annual vegetative growth demand for K\nwas slightly different, as K demand declined sharply after peaking at month 88, and only\nreverted upward at month 238. Annual fruit-bunch demand for N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B\nclosely followed annual fruit-bunch production (Figure 3; Table 4), with a steady increase\nfrom 48 months after nursery planting, up to month 209 when fruit-bunch production\npeaked. Thereafter, nutrient demand declined following lower fruit-bunch production.\nAnnual total nutrient demand appeared to follow nutrient demand for vegetative growth,\nwith maximum nutrient demand occurring at month 209 when fruit bunch-production\nreached its peak\u2014except for K demand, which occurred at month 88, when vegetative\ngrowth demand for K peaked (Figure 3). At 12 months old, the total nutrient demand of\nthe tenera oil palm was 18 g N, 2.3 g P, 25 g K, 2.5 g Mg, 4.1 g Ca, and 0.01 g B per palm .\nHowever, its annual nutrient demand increased substantially to its maximum at 2.34 kg N,\n0.35 kg P, 4.36 kg K, 0.50 kg Mg, 1.14 kg Ca, and 3.0 g B per palm. These amounts of\nnutrients are sufficient to meet annual fruit-bunch production of 30 t ha _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 12 of 18\n\n\n**Figure 3.** Mean amounts of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B required to meet nutrient demand for vegetative\ngrowth and fruit-bunch production of tenera oil palm of different ages sampled in this study. Error\n\nbars are standard errors.\n\n\nDuring the entire duration of 238 months of palm growth, K was the most required\nnutrient, which accounted for about 54% of total nutrient demand, followed by N at about\n25%, while P, Mg, and Ca accounted for about 4, 6, and 12% of total nutrient demand,\nrespectively. Not surprisingly, as it is a micronutrient, B demand was the lowest, at about\n0.03%. Of the measured nutrients, between 37 and 54% of N, P, Mg, Ca, and B taken up by\nthe tenera palms across different ages was partitioned to fruit bunches; except for K, which\nwas lower (ranged between 19 and 36%) (Table 10).\n\n\n**Table 10.** Proportion of nutrients (mean _\u00b1_ SE) partitioned to fruit bunches in tenera oil palms of\ndifferent ages.

Discussion**\n\n_4.1. Standing Vegetative Biomass and Dry-Matter Production_\n\n\nThe aboveground dry weight of tenera palms measured in this study were comparable\nto previous studies on either dura or tenera palms grown on different soils and under\ndifferent management practices in Malaysia [ 16, 18, 34 ] and in Indonesia [ 35, 36 ] (Figure S2).\nOur results suggest that accumulation of aboveground vegetative biomass in oil palm tends\nto remain relatively constant across different types of planting materials and environments.\nHowever, clear differences in aboveground vegetative biomass accumulation were observed\non palms grown under suboptimal conditions such as peat in Malaysia [ 37 ] and in West\nAfrica [ 15, 38 ]. The poor growing conditions of peat [ 39, 40 ] and marked dry seasons\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 13 of 18\n\n\nprevailing in West Africa [ 41 ] would have detrimentally affected the growth of the sampled\npalms there; hence, they accumulated less aboveground vegetative biomass.\nThe rapid increase in dry-matter production during the first 88 months of planting is typical of oil palm and is consistent with previous studies [ 2, 16 ]. Production of\naboveground vegetative dry matter in mature palms was in close agreement with studies conducted in Malaysia [ 2, 16 ] but was much higher than in oil palms studied in West\nAfrica [ 15, 38 ] (Table S3). Seasonal drought (6 consecutive months with monthly mean\nrainfall of less than 100 mm per month _[\u2212]_ [1] ) [ 11 ] in West Africa would have affected the rate\nof leaf production and expansion [ 36, 42 ], and in turn resulted in lower leaf dry-matter\nproduction. Ng et al. [ 2 ], on the other hand, might have underestimated leaf dry-matter\nproduction by only considering 18 pruned leaves with average leaf dry weight of 3.95 kg\nwhile overestimating trunk dry-matter production by including leaf bases as part of the trunk.\nIf root dry-matter production is considered, the total vegetative dry-matter production\nestimated in this study agreed with Dufrene\u2019s estimation [ 38 ] of 171.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1],\nbut this was about 25% higher than Corley et al. [ 16 ] and 75% higher than Rees and\nTinker [ 15 ]. Dufrene [ 38 ] and this study estimated annual root dry-matter production,\nbut the other studies only considered net increase in root dry weight, and this perhaps\nexplains the observed differences. If Equation (4), which was developed in Malaysia, was\nused to estimate the root dry-matter production in Corley et al. [ 16 ], then total vegetative\ndry-matter production would be increased to 144.7 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1], quite close to the\npresent estimate of 168.2 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] (Table S3). It is thus obvious that production\nof vegetative dry matter could be quite similar across different environments, but the\npartitioning of above- and belowground vegetative dry matter might vary depending on\nthe prevailing growing conditions. Dufrene [ 38 ] showed that oil palm tends to partition\nmore dry matter to roots in places with pronounced dry seasons. In this study, the root\ndry-matter production was estimated using Equation (4) developed in Malaysia [ 31 ]. The\nestimated root dry-matter production only represents about 10.4% of total aboveground\nvegetative dry-matter production. This is a considerably small fraction of dry matter\npartitioned to the roots as argued by Corley and Tinker [ 11 ] (pp. 341\u2013342). Thus, it\nseems that further studies are required to ascertain root dry-matter production of tenera\npalms at different ages of growth, since this has important implication on total dry-matter\nproduction, partitioning, and vegetative growth demand for nutrients.\nBunch dry matter produced in this study was comparable to the amounts produced\nelsewhere in Malaysia but was 1.6 to 2 times more than those in West Africa (Table S3).\nThis is not unexpected, as dry-matter requirements for vegetative growth appear to be met\nfirst before any surplus dry matter is diverted to bunch production. This surplus is smaller\nin less-conducive environments like West Africa, where a marked dry season prevails.\nConsequently, total dry-matter production across different environments might not vary as\nsubstantially as highlighted here. Total dry-matter production found in this study was only\n15% more than Dufrene [38], despite having produced 61% more bunch dry matter.\n\n\n_4.2. Nutrient Concentrations and Nutrient Demand_\n\n\nThe variations in nutrient concentrations among vegetative tissues found in this study\nwere consistent with previous studies [ 2, 4, 5, 17, 18, 21, 43 ]. These results confirm that the\nuptake of nutrients cannot be reliably deduced from leaf nutrient analysis alone [ 43 ], as\nhigh concentrations of nutrients are also found in other vegetative tissues such as rachis,\npetiole, leaf bases, and trunk. Classical fertilizer recommendation methodology based\nsolely on leaf nutrient analysis data must consider the variations in nutrient concentrations\namong vegetative tissues. Considerable palm-to-palm variations in nutrient concentrations\nmight be attributed to genetic differences, since tenera palms planted at the study site came\nfrom different genetic origins. It has been shown that nutrient uptake could vary by up\nto 30\u201340% among oil-palm planting materials [ 43 ]. It is also possible that the variations\nobserved were caused by genetic\u2013environmental interactions. We therefore recommend\nestablishing plantations with blocks of homogenous oil-palm planting materials in order to\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 14 of 18\n\n\nobtain a more reliable estimate of fertilizer requirements. In the case of existing plantations\nwith mixed oil-palm planting materials, an appropriate sampling size should be established\nfor every management block so as to minimize variation.\nMuch higher nutrient concentrations found in the cabbage were expected and have\nbeen documented [ 2, 21 ]. This plant part is the growing point of the palm, so it is not\nsurprising to observe a much higher concentration of nutrients here, as more nutrients\nare required to grow developing tissues, such as immature leaves and leaf bases. Higher\nK concentrations found in all vegetative tissues, particularly in the trunk, agreed with\nprevious findings [ 2, 18, 43, 44 ], and confirmed its prominent role in the nutrition of oil palm.\nThe high concentrations of nutrients found in the leaf bases highlight the importance of\nthis plant part as nutrient sink and stock, and it should be given due attention since it\nconstitutes a significant portion of vegetative biomass (Table 2). The amounts of nutrients\nimmobilized by leaf bases and recycled back to the soil through shedding of leaf bases\ncould be significant [ 45 ]. The low nutrient concentrations found in the roots have been\nreported [2,4,5,21].\nThe higher concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca found in the whole immature and\nmature tenera studied here (Table 6), suggest that the tenera studied here might require\nmore N, P, K, Mg, and Ca to sustain vegetative growth for a same unit of biomass produced.\nRecent advances in agronomic practices might have improved the uptake of nutrients, and\nled to the observed higher concentrations of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca. It is also possible that\nthe presently studied tenera had higher nutrient concentrations in its vegetative tissues\nintrinsically as a result of advances in oil-palm breeding [43].\nThe decline in concentrations of N and P with age, particularly in the trunk, has been\nreported [ 2 ]. Henson and Chang [ 46 ] analyzed published nutrient concentration data and\nfound that only concentrations of N and P in the trunk declined with age, while N, P,\nand K concentrations in other palm tissues did not. The present study confirmed their\nfindings but also found that concentrations of N and P in the leaves, concentration of Mg\nin the leaves and trunk, and concentrations of Ca and B in the trunk declined with age\n(Table 7). The ability of oil palm to store K in vegetative tissues might explain the lack of\ncorrelation between K concentration and palm age [ 18, 44 ]. This is supported by higher K\nconcentrations found in the vegetative tissues such as rachis, petiole, leaf bases, trunk, and\nbole (Table 5). If whole-palm nutrient concentration is considered, only K concentration\ndid not decline with age (Table 7). The physiological mechanism underlying the decline\nin concentration of nutrients in plant tissues with plant or organ age is complex and has\nnot been fully understood [ 47 ]. One plausible explanation is that as the plant grows and\naccumulates more biomass, the increase in plant or organ biomass is greater than the\ncorresponding increase in nutrient content. This eventually decreases the concentration of\nnutrients due to the dilution effect of biomass [ 47, 48 ]. Trunk K behaved quite differently\nin relation to palm age. It tended to increase with palm age initially before declining to\na more stable level (Figure S3). Ng et al. [ 2 ] observed a similar trend of K concentration\nin the trunk (Figure S3). They argued that oil palm tends to build up a K reserve in the\ntrunk during the early years of planting, but this reserve will deplete gradually soon after\nfruit-bunch production peaks. The present observation seems to agree with Ng et al. [ 2 ] as K\nconcentration in the trunk tended to decrease with increasing fruit-bunch yield in both studies.\nThe variations in nutrient concentrations among bunch components found in this\nstudy were consistent with previous studies [ 6, 19 \u2013 21, 33 ]. The most striking variation is the\nnutrient concentrations in the mesocarp. The tenera bunches studied here had much higher\nN, P, K, Mg, and Ca concentrations in their mesocarps than previously studied dura and\ntenera bunches (Table 8). Consequently, the tenera bunches studied here contain higher N,\nP, K, Mg, and Ca contents than previously studied dura and tenera bunches (Table 9). It is\nthus obvious that for the same production level of fruit bunches, the tenera studied here\nwould require more nutrients to support fruit-bunch production.\nThe rapid increase in nutrient demand in the first 88 months since nursery planting\nwas mainly driven by growth rate (Table 4), consistent with Ng et al. [ 2 ] and Goh et al. [ 21 ],\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 15 of 18\n\n\nand also suggests that derivation of nutrient requirements from palms of one age or\nfrom mature palms alone appears inadequate. Higher demand of N, P, Mg, Ca, and B at\nmonth 209 was attributed to high demand of these nutrients for fruit-bunch production\n( Figure 3; Table 4 ). The decline in K demand for vegetative growth after month 88 was\nconsistent with the decline in trunk K concentration (Figures 3 and S3). It appears that the\nstudied tenera did not increase its K uptake when fruit-bunch demand for K increased due\nto increasing fruit-bunch production but instead used K reserved in the vegetative tissues,\nparticularly trunk K, to meet fruit-bunch production. Thus, it is important to build up K\nreserves during the early years of planting to meet increased K demand in later years. Teoh\nand Chew [ 18 ] estimated that trunk K reserve of fully fertilized tenera palms could support\nvegetative growth and fruit-bunch production for 2 to 6 years.\nThe substantial amounts of nutrients required annually by the tenera studied here reemphasize the large fertilizer needs of oil palm and the importance of judicious manuring\nthat meets agronomic, economic, and environmental objectives. The amounts of nutrients\ndepicted in Figure 3 were regarded as gross nutrient demand [ 2, 11 ] since nutrients recycled\nfrom pruned leaves were not considered. If annual fruit-bunch production of 25 t ha _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nis considered, the annual gross nutrient demand of mature tenera studied here would\nbe 1.99 kg N, 0.28 kg P, 3.94 kg K, 0.42 kg Mg, and 0.99 kg Ca palm _[\u2212]_ [1] which is about\n53, 57, 132, and 64% more N, P, K, and Ca than found in the dura studied by Ng et al. [ 2 ],\nrespectively, but Mg demand was only 2% higher than in the dura. No difference was\nfound when annual B demand was compared with another mature tenera [ 21 ], as both\nrequired 2.5 g palm _[\u2212]_ [1] .\nHowever, if nutrients contained in the pruned leaves were all recycled, the annual\nnet demand of nutrients would be 1.04 kg N, 0.16 kg P, 1.85 kg K, 0.26 kg Mg, 0.47 kg Ca,\nand 1.3 g B palm _[\u2212]_ [1] . These amounts were higher than net nutrient demand of fully fertilized mature dura [ 2 ] and tenera [ 18 ] studied previously. Teoh and Chew [ 18 ] found\nthat fully fertilized mature tenera grown on different soils in Malaysia required 1.34 to\n1.59 kg K palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] if K recycled from pruned leaves was considered. The higher\nnutrient demand is not unexpected because of higher nutrient concentrations found in\nthe vegetative tissues and fruit bunches of tenera studied here, and given that dry-matter\nproduction of either dura or tenera planting materials could be quite similar, especially\nwhen they are grown under favorable environments (Table S3). Therefore, for the same\nlevel of dry-matter production, the tenera studied here would need more nutrients.\nFruit bunches accounted for the largest portion of required N, P, Mg, Ca, and B, except\nin the case of K (Table 9), because a large portion of K is stored in vegetative tissues such\nas leaves, trunk, and leaf bases (Table 6). Goh et al. [ 44 ] found that fully fertilized mature\ntenera grown on different soils in Malaysia partitioned 70\u201373% of their K demand to\nvegetative tissues, whereas unfertilized tenera partitioned 55\u201370%. Thus, from the fertilizer\nmanagement context, the production level of fruit bunches has great influence on the\ndetermination of fertilizer requirements of oil palm.\n\n\n_4.3. Implications on Fertilizer Requirements of Oil Palm_\n\n\nThe tenera studied here has been fertilized following standard commercial fertilizer\nregimes that are commonly practiced in the palm-oil industry in Malaysia (Table 1). The\nvegetative dry matter and fruit-bunch production of this tenera was comparable to fully\nfertilized tenera studied in Malaysia [ 4, 5, 16 ], suggesting that the tenera studied here must\nbe growing at its potential. The tenera were neither deficient nor luxuriant in nutrient\ncontent since the net amounts of nutrients required for vegetative growth and fruit-bunch\nproduction closely matched the applied fertilizer quantities after accounting for losses\nto the environments [ 49, 50 ] (Table S4). The small deficit of about 46 kg N, 54 kg K, and\n11 kg Mg per hectare per year could be easily supplied by Harimau Series soil (Typic\nPaleudult). Soils in Malaysia could supply 90 to 194 kg N and 62 to 189 kg K per hectare\nper year [ 4, 44 ]. Therefore, the growth demand for nutrients determined in this study could\nserve as the potential nutrient demand of tenera oil palm grown under current agronomic\n\n\n_Agronomy_ **2022**, _12_, 426 16 of 18\n\n\npractices in Malaysia, and perhaps elsewhere. The nutrient demand data obtained here can\nbe used together with soil and foliar nutrient analysis data to further refine the fertilizer\nrequirements for tenera oil palm grown on different soil types.\n\n\n**5. Conclusions**\n\n\nThe present study closes a significant gap in the nutrient management of tenera oil\npalm grown under current agronomic practices, by determining its nutrient demand at\ndifferent ages of growth.\nAlthough the dry-matter production of commercially grown tenera has not increased\nover the years, its N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B concentrations in vegetative tissues and fruit\nbunches were found to be higher. This has led to higher demand of these nutrients, which\nshould be given due attention when formulating fertilizer requirements for tenera grown\nunder current agronomic practices. The present findings provide an opportunity to match\nthe nutrient demand of tenera at different ages of growth. This allows more sustainable\nproduction of palm oil that meets agronomic, economic and environmental objectives.\nImportant findings of this study are summarized below.\n\n\n(1) Excluding roots, the total standing vegetative biomass increased almost linearly from\n1.3 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 808.6 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] at 238 months old.\n(2) Whole palm dry-matter production increased with palm age but at a decreasing\nrate, from 1.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] at 12 months old to 285.5 kg palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] after\n133 months, with little increase thereafter.\n(3) Nutrient concentrations in vegetative tissues varied considerably depending on palm\nage, nutrient element, and tissue types. The tenera studied here generally had higher\nnutrient concentrations in the vegetative tissues and fruit bunches than previously\nstudied dura and tenera.\n\n(4) The maximum N, P, Mg, Ca, and B demand occurred at month 209 during peak\nproduction of fruit bunches, while maximum K demand occurred at 88 months after\nnursery planting, when vegetative growth demand for K peaked.\n(5) Tenera bunches studied here contain 4.74 kg N, 0.79 kg P, 6.35 kg K, 1.31 kg Mg,\n2.30 kg Ca, and 5.9 g B per tonne of fresh fruit bunches.\n(6) Total amounts of nutrients required to produce 25 t fresh fruit bunches ha _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1]\n\nwere 1.99 kg N, 0.28 kg P, 3.94 kg K, 0.42 kg Mg, 0.99 kg Ca, and 2.5 g B palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n(7) If all leaves produced in a year were pruned off and all its nutrients were recycled, the\nnet amounts of nutrients required to produce 25 t fresh fruit bunches ha _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] would\nbe 1.04 kg N, 0.16 kg P, 1.85 kg K, 0.26 kg Mg, 0.47 kg Ca, and 1.3 g B palm _[\u2212]_ [1] year _[\u2212]_ [1] .\n\n\n**Supplementary Materials:** [The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/agronomy12020426/s1)\n[10.3390/agronomy12020426/s1, Figure S1: Leaf production rate of tenera oil palm grown under](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/agronomy12020426/s1)\nMalaysian inland environment, Figure S2: Aboveground vegetative biomass of oil palm as quantified\nin this study and previous studies, Figure S3: Trunk K concentration in relation to palm age and\nfruit bunch yield in Ng et al.

Ciampitti** **1** \n\n**Continuous potassium (K) removal without replenishment is progressively mining Argentinean soils.**\n**Our goals were to evaluate the sensitivity of soil-K to K budgets, quantify soil-K changes over time**\n**along the soil profile, and identify soil variables that regulate soil-K depletion. Four on-farm trials**\n**under two crop rotations including maize, wheat and soybean were evaluated. Three treatments**\n**were compared: (1) control (no fertilizer applied); (2) application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur**\n**fertilizers -NPS-; and (3) pristine condition. After nine years, crops removed from 258 to 556 kg K \u00adha** **[\u22121]** **.**\n**Only two sites showed a decline in the exchangeable-K levels at 0\u201320 cm but unrelated to K budget.**\n**Topsoil exchangeable-K levels under agriculture resulted 48% lower than their pristine conditions,**\n**although still above response levels. Both soil exchangeable-K and slowly-exchangeable K vertical**\n**distribution patterns (0\u2013100 cm) displayed substantial depletion relative to pristine conditions, mainly**\n**concentrated at subsoil (20\u2013100 cm), with 55\u201383% for exchangeable-K, and 74\u201395% for slowly-**\n**exchangeable-K. Higher pristine levels of exchangeable-K and slowly-exchangeable-K and lower clay**\n**and silt contents resulted in higher soil-K depletion. Soil K management guidelines should consider**\n**both topsoil and subsoil nutrient status and variables related to soil K buffer capacity.**\n\n\nPotassium (K) is an essential macronutrient required by crops, which exhibit a broad range of K requirements\n(40\u2013300 kg \u00adha [\u22121] \u00adyear [\u22121] ) and K removal from the harvested \u00adproduct [1] . Wheat ( _Triticum aestivum_ L.) and maize\n( _Zea mays_ L.) crops export around 3 kg K \u00adMg [\u22121], whereas soybean ( _Glycine max_ L.) exports 16 kg K \u00adMg [\u22121][2][\u2013][4] .\nThe main source of plant K is the soil, where K is distributed in four different pools: (1) soil solution K, (2)\nexchangeable K \u00ad(NH 4 -OAc-K), (3) slowly exchangeable K \u00ad(NaBPh 4 -K), and (4) K-bearing primary \u00adminerals [5][\u2013][7] .\nThe soil solution-K and NH4-OAc-K fractions are the most readily available K source to plants. Thus, fertilizer\nrecommendations are mostly based on these \u00adfractions [8] . The NaBPh4-K pool includes less available K fractions\nalbeit has received more attention for diagnosing K fertilization needs during the last \u00addecades [9][\u2013][11] . Finally, the\nmineral-K is a recalcitrant soil K fraction, usually not considered for K diagnosing purposes.\nPotassium can be acquired from all soil layers explored by plant roots, depending on the crop species and\non vertical distribution of plant available \u00adK [12] . Although root mass is concentrated at topsoil, maize root mass\nwas reported as poorly correlated with root activity, which can remain high until 60 cm \u00addepth [13] . Spring cereals\nmight take up to 80% of the K from the 0\u201325 cm \u00adlayer [14], while soybeans may take about to 60% of the K from\nthe 0\u201330 cm \u00adlayer [15] .\nStudies at a global scale indicate that the stratification towards the topsoil is less marked for K than for other\nmajor nutrients such as phosphorus and \u00adnitrogen [16] . Thus, only a portion of the soil K available for plants is\ncaptured if soil samples are collected from the topsoil (i.e. 0\u201320 cm depth) [17] . This underestimation is reduced\nin those soils with a high topsoil K \u00adstratification [14] . Stratification normally occurs when K fertilizer is applied in\nthe \u00adtopsoil [18], as well as when roots uptake K from deeper soil layers and residues are deposited in the \u00adtopsoil [16] .\nThis process is enhanced in fertilized and high-yielding systems, involving a high deposition of plant residues\nsuch as in no-tillage \u00adsystems [19] .\nMost agricultural soils of the Argentine Pampas are characterized by high native soil K linked to the clay\nmineralogy (predominantly illite) of the parental \u00admaterial [20] . Positive yield responses to K fertilization have been\nrarely observed in the region so far; thus, fertilizer K applications have been negligible during the Argentinean\nagricultural era, which started around 100 years ago. However, continuous K removal via harvest is gradually\n\n\n1 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University, 3031 Throckmorton Plant Sciences Center, Manhattan,\nKS 66506, USA.

Under comparable negative K budgets in Pampean soils, greater \u00adNH 4 -OAc reductions (46% vs. 8%) at the topsoil were found in soils with high- (900 mg \u00adkg [\u22121] ) relative to low-initial (600 mg \u00adkg [\u22121] )\n\u00adNH 4 -OAc-K \u00adlevels [22] . However, most of Pampean soils are still above the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K critical level (about\n130\u2013170 mg K \u00adkg [\u22121] ) [21] .\nThe aim of this study was to quantify the effect of contrasting K removal on soil K fractions along the soil\nprofile. We hypothesize that: (1) in high native K soils, the topsoil (0\u201320 cm) \u00adNH 4 -OAc test is not sensitive to\nidentify short-medium term K depletion trends; (2) vertical distribution patterns of both \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and\n\u00adNaBPh 4 -K are affected by the agricultural footprint, with a significant depletion expected to occur beyond the\ntopsoil (0\u201320 cm); and (3) soil K deviates from the Pristine conditions depending on soil factors related to K\nbuffer capacity such as soil texture and indigenous richness of soil K, with more depletion expected to occur for\nboth K fractions with coarser textures and high pristine soil K levels.\n\n\n**Results**\n**Cumulative K budget.** Cumulative K budget reflects continuous K removal, without K fertilization. The\nhigh-yielding system, NPS treatment (Fig. 1), significantly increased K removal, with an average annual K\nremoval ranging from \u2212 29 to \u2212 62 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] \u00adyear [\u22121] . After more than 10 harvests, the cumulative K budget\nfor the Control varied from \u2212 258 to \u2212 421 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] and for the NPS ranged from \u2212 467 to \u2212 556 kg K \u00adha [\u22121]\n(Fig. 1). San Alfredo, La Blanca and La Hansa sites presented comparable K removal on Control plots (\u2212 330\nto \u2212 421 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] ), whereas Balducchi exhibited lower K removal (\u2212 258 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] ). Cumulative removal at the\nNPS resulted similar across sites (\u2212 467 to \u2212 556 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] ). Differences in K removal are largely explained by\nfinal yields, with lower yield for the Control in Balducchi but with similar yield for the NPS relative to the other\nsites (average 1.9 vs. 3.2 Mg \u00adha [\u22121], with larger yield gap for Control and NPS, respectively).\n\n\n**Topsoil \u00adNH** **4** **\u2011OAc\u2011K changes.** The evolution of \u00adNH 4 -Oac-K in the topsoil (0\u201320 cm) was site-specific\n(Fig. 1). The sites with longest agricultural history at the beginning of the experiment (Balducchi and La Hansa),\npresented significant \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K reductions from 2000 to 2009. The opposite occurred in those sites with\nshorter farming history at the beginning of the experiment (< 10 year: San Alfredo and La Blanca), with no differences between initial and final NH4-OAc-K levels. Surprisingly, no differences were detected between Control\nand NPS in any case (Fig. 1, Table 2). Thus, the lack of change or negligible reductions in topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K\nover cropping seasons did not correspond with the increasingly negative K budgets.\n\n\n**Vertical distribution patterns of soil \u00adKNH** **4** **\u2011OAcK.** The \u00adNH 4 -OAcK fraction was predominantly\nlocated (range 72\u201386%) in the subsoil (20\u2013100 cm) with significant differences between sites and treatments\n(Table 2). Under the Pristine conditions, the distribution in depth showed notorious differences among the\nfour sites (green circles; Fig. 2). The most contrasting soils were Balducchi and San Alfredo, portraying greater\n\u00adNH 4 -OAc-K towards the subsoil and topsoil, respectively. La Blanca and La Hansa sites presented a fairly similar\nPristine \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K pattern, following a sinuous trajectory with minimum levels at 20\u201340 cm, and rather comparable values at shallower and deeper layers. Interestingly, observed differences among soils were not reflected\nin the average \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K stocks (0\u2013100 cm), that were rather equivalent (1359, 1055, 1228, and 1284 g \u00adm [\u22122] for\nBalducchi, San Alfredo, La Blanca and La Hansa, respectively).\nA remarkable effect of agriculture was reflected in a considerable decrease in the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K levels for the\nControl and NPS relative to their Pristine condition (Table 2; Fig. 2) although its vertical distribution varied\ndepending on the location (Fig. 2). At all locations, significant interactions between treatment and soil depth\nwere documented (Supplementary material 1, Appendix A). Balducchi and La Blanca (Hapludolls), showed the\nhigher \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K depletion rates (averaging 63 and 37%; respectively), which was exacerbated towards the\nsubsoil (60\u2013100 cm). Contrastingly, in San Alfredo and La Hansa (Argiudolls), \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K reductions due to\nagriculture were lower (average 25 and 27%, respectively) and occurred mainly towards the topsoil (Table 2).\nDifferences in \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K between the Control and NPS showed a lower magnitude than relative for the difference of those treatments to the Pristine due to differences in time-spans (Cropping history, Table 1).\n\n\n**NaBPh** **4** **\u2011K.** Similarly to \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K, the slowly-exchangeable fraction \u00ad(NaBPh 4 -K) was found predominantly in the subsoil (20\u2013100 cm) (range 78\u201381%), without large differences between sites or treatments\n(Table 2). The \u00adNaBPh 4 -K contents were 2.1 times in average (range 1.2\u00d7\u20136.2\u00d7) larger than the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K.\nTreatment by soil depth interaction was significant (p < 0.05) at Balducchi and La Blanca, while main effects\nof treatment (p = 0.05) and soil depth (p < 0.05) were significant at La Hansa, and only soil depth resulted in a\nmarginally significant effect (p = 0.11) at San Alfredo (Fig. 3) (Supplementary material 1, Appendix A). Balducchi showed the larger impact of agriculture on their \u00adNaBPh 4 -K levels (average 41% depletion as compared to the\nPristine scenario), whereas the other sites varied in a rather small range (5\u201317%).\n\n\n**Soil K depletion drivers.** The \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K depletion patterns followed a close association with the Pristine- \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and clay content of each soil layer (Fig. 4). For the Pristine- \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K, the greater the native\nK values, the larger was the documented depletion K rate. On the other hand, increases in soil clay (%) levels\nwere associated with lower depletion \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K rate until reaching a threshold about 33% of clay, remaining\nat a minimum level for \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K depletion with high clay content. Conversely, for \u00adNaBPh 4 -K depletion, the\nmost relevant factor resulted the silt content (%), showing a depletion trend until reaching a threshold of 50%\nof silt, above of which the \u00adNaBPh 4 -K depletion becomes minimum. A relatively weak but positive association\nto Pristine-NaBPh 4 -K content was also observed, however; it resulted less relevant than for the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K\ndepletion.\n\n\n\n**Scientific Reports** |    (2021) 11:11597 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90297-1\n\n\nVol:.(1234567890)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\n\n**Figure 1.** Grain yield, cumulative K removal by grain (K budget), and \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K at 0\u201320 cm for check\ntreatment with no fertilizers added (Control) and fertilized plots with N, P and S (NPS) for each experimental\nsite under two different cropping sequences (Table 1) from 2000 to 2009.

In\nfact, after nine years of cropping with negative K budgets, only two out of the four sites showed changes in this\ntopsoil K fraction. These two locations (Balducchi and La Hansa) are both characterized by presenting the longest continuous cropping-history, which may have led to greater reductions not only in terms of measured soil K\nfractions but also related to total soil K. Unfortunately, no historical yield data was available to further explore\nhypotheses related to the effect of cropping history. Nonetheless, these results would indicate that continuous\n\n\n\n**Scientific Reports** |    (2021) 11:11597 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90297-1\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\n\n**Figure 2.** Soil profiles of \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K (g \u00adm [\u22122] ) under three different conditions: pristine soils (green circles),\nunder grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with no fertilizers added (Control, orange triangles), and under\ngrain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with N, P, plus S fertilization (NPS, purple diamonds). Overlapping error\nbars indicate absence of significant differences between scenarios by soil depths combinations (Tukey\u2019s HSD,\n_p_ < 0.05).\n\n\nK removal after nine years of farming has come from extra K-pools (e.g., non-exchangeable-K, root K uplift)\nrather than the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K at top-soil.\nIn line with recent surveys performed in the Pampean \u00adRegion [21], our four soils remained high in K fertility\nalong the experimental period, as reflected by topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K values above the critical level. Considering an\naverage annual K removal of 62 kg K \u00adha [\u22121] (average yields for the studied crop rotation), a soil should lose about\n15 mg \u00adkg [\u22121] of soil K a year. If all the K budget is reflected on the NH4-OAc-K at topsoil, the critical range could\nbe reached in between 6 (Balducchi) to 224 years (La Blanca). Nonetheless, observed variability is in line with\nSimonsson et al. [23], who reported that, besides the K budget, the soil K depletion results from the interaction of\nmultiple factors such as cropping history, soil texture and mineralogy and potential subsoil K supply. Additionally, our data reveals that the subsoil \u00adNH 4 OAc-K levels are decreasing but still high.\nRegarding our second hypothesis, we found evidence to support that K depletion occurs mainly beyond the\ntopsoil. Both soil exchangeable and slowly-exchangeable K vertical distribution patterns displayed large depletion\nrelative to the Pristine scenario in the whole soil profile (0\u2013100 cm). However, depletion of both fractions was\nmore pronounced at subsoil (20\u2013100 cm) (55\u201383% for \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and 74\u201395% for \u00adNaBPh 4 -K) rather than in\nthe usually tested 0\u201320 cm soil layer. It is known that plants can remobilize K from the subsoil towards shallow\n\u00adlayers [16][,][24][,][25], and this effect would be exacerbated under minimum or no-tillage management where the stover\nmay release significant amounts of soluble K that later has low mobility into the soil \u00admatrix [19][,][26] . Thus, our results\nhighlight the relevance of subsoil on the K supply for \u00adcrops [27] and thus, of building awareness about soil K profile\n\u00adconcentrations [28] . For practical reasons, most of soil K recommendation systems are based on topsoil data without\nconsidering the subsoil\u2014e.g _._ 0\u201315 cm in the US Corn Belt, where also Mollisols is the dominant soil \u00adorder [29] .\nHowever, our results are consistent with a K recommendation system based on the combined \u00adNH 4 -OAc information from both the topsoil and the subsoil such as former system in \u00adIowa [29] and recommendations in \u00adIndia [30] .\nLastly, obtained results fully support our third hypothesis, since the two main factors affecting K depletion\nrates were the pristine K levels and the soil texture (reflected as clay and silt content). In the same long-term\nexperiment, Sucunza et al. [31] reported a similar tendency for phosphorus: the higher the pristine nutrient levels\nthe higher the nutrient depletion rates. In terms of soil texture, its influence on \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K critical levels is well\n\u00addocumented [9][,][32][,][33], as well as soil K buffer capacity is affected by clay content and \u00admineralogy [34][\u2013][37] .

Thus, an increased soil K buffer capacity could mask the effects of continuous K removal.\nIn other soils, negative K budgets were reflected not only in \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K but also in changes in more stable and\nrecalcitrant soil K \u00adfractions [9][,][11][,][24][,][37][,][39] . Finally, our results also indicate that the root K uplift process was accentuated at locations without fine-textured horizons (Balducchi and La Blanca). Thus, soil layers with greater clay\ncontent involve not only a high buffer capacity but may also denote a mechanical impedance to root \u00adgrowth [40],\n\n.\nultimately affecting K uptake and \u00adremoval [41]\nThis research offers an indication that topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K interacts with subsoil K and other soil K pools as\na K source for satisfying plant nutrient demand. Yet, it is worth acknowledging the need of more comprehensive\nstudies on soil-K depletion trends in response to different crop management practices for the Pampean Mollisols.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\nThe high indigenous-K fertility of Pampean Mollisols is progressively being depleted due to the prolonged and\nintensive agricultural use without K replenishment, thereby rendering them to express responsiveness to K in a\nnear future. Continuous K removal by crop harvest without K replenishment led to soil K depletion primarily\nconcentrated in the subsoil. In such sense, the single use of topsoil \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K in high native K soils could result\nin an incomplete assessment of soil K fertility diagnosis. Instead, both topsoil and subsoil K analyses could be\ncomplemented to develop more precise guidelines on medium-to-long-term K fertilizer needs. Also, as soil K\ndepletion increased with indigenous K level and decreased with finer soil texture, including them as key metadata\nwill contribute for an improved development of soil K guidelines.\n\n\n**Methods**\n**Experimental sites.** The Pampas region is located in the East-Central region of Argentina.

Four\nsites from the network, differing in soil properties and management history, were selected for this study (Table 1).\nTwo sites were under maize\u2013double-cropped wheat/soybean (M-W/S) rotation\u2014Balducchi (34\u00b0 9\u2032 26.0\u2033 S, 61\u00b0\n36\u2032 33.8\u2033 W) and San Alfredo (33\u00b0 53\u2032 14.1\u2033 S, 61\u00b0 27\u2032 30.5\u2033 W), and two sites were under maize-full-season\nsoybean-double-cropped wheat/soybean (M-S-W/S) rotation-La Blanca (33\u00b0 29\u2032 57.2\u2033 S, 62\u00b0 37\u2032 55.3\u2033 W) and\nLa Hansa (32\u00b0 23\u2032 04.2\u2033 S, 61\u00b0 11\u2032 58.8\u2033 W).\n\n\n**Design and measurements.** The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with three\nreplicates. Plot size was 25\u201330 m wide and 65\u201370 m long. Two contrasting fertilizer treatments were evaluated:\n(1) control, without fertilization, (2) the recommended nutrient management, including the three most deficient\nnutrients in the region\u2014N, P, and S (NPS). Additionally, adjacent soils to experimental plots with no antecedents\nof agriculture were evaluated as pristine soil conditions (Pristine). For the NPS treatment, N and S were applied\nat rates based on crop demand, ranged from 90 to 175 kg N \u00adyear [\u22121] and from 17 to 25 kg S \u00adyear [\u22121], P rates were\ndecided each season before planting according to the attainable yield and P removal, averaging 37 kg P \u00adyear [\u22121] .\nNitrogen fertilizer was not added to soybean. All nutrients were applied before or at planting using solid fertilizer blends. The source of N was urea (46% N), for P was mono-ammonium phosphate (23% P), and for S was\ncalcium sulfate (19% S).\nFor all treatments, crop residues were not removed or grazed and negligible K losses from leaching and/or\nrunoff were assumed. Annual budgets were estimated from crop grain yield and grain K concentrations data.\nNo differences in grain K content between Control and NPS treatments were observed during the first years\n(2000\u20132002), and no grain-K measurements were made for the 2003\u20132009 period. For grain crops, provided\ncrops evidence of K sufficiency, seed K contents are highly conserved that other management practices impacting\nyields are often inconsequential for grain K \u00adconcentration [46][\u2013][49] . Therefore, average values (2000\u20132002) of 4.0, 5.7\nand 19.0 g K \u00adkg [\u22121] grain for maize, wheat and soybean, respectively, were assumed to be constant for K removal\ncalculations. Those values are in range with previously published data for \u00admaize [2], \u00adwheat [3], and \u00adsoybean [4][,][50] .\nSoil samples were collected at early spring in 2000, 2004 (0\u201320 cm) and 2009 (0\u2013100 cm, see below) for all\ntreatments. Soil properties related to total organic C, soil-test \u00adP [51], soil \u00adpH [52] (1:2.5 soil:water), bulk \u00addensity [53], and\nsecondary \u00adelements [54][,][55] were determined at the onset of the trial (2000). Soil extractable-K was determined by\nthe pH 7 buffered 1.0 M ammonium-acetate method \u00ad(NH 4 -OAc-K) [56] . Soil texture was measured also at the onset\nof the trial at topsoil (0\u201320 cm) and the rest of the soil layers (20\u2013100 cm) were obtained from the Soil Survey\n\n\n\n**Scientific Reports** |    (2021) 11:11597 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90297-1\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\n\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\n\nSummary of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog\u00eda Agropecuaria,\nINTA).\nIn 2009, three sub-samples of soil profiles per plot were sampled and fresh mixed at five depths (0\u201320, 20\u201340,\n40\u201360, 60\u201380, and 80\u2013100 cm), dried at 40 \u00b0C until constant weight, and sieved (2 mm). Soil extractable-K was\ndetermined as \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K [50], and by the modified sodium tetraphenyl boron method \u00ad(NaBPh 4 -K) [9] . The vertical distribution of both \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K was expressed on a volumetric basis (g \u00adm [\u22122] ) as in Jobbagy\nand \u00adJackson [16] . Bulk density, determined for Control and NPS plots at the onset of the study for each soil layer\n(Table 1), was used to transform from gravimetric (mg \u00adkg [\u22121] ) to volumetric units (g \u00adm [\u22122] ).\n\n\n**Statistical analysis.** For testing the first hypothesis, variables of interest were the topsoil \u00adNH 4 OAc-K\n(0\u201320 cm) for 2000, 2004 and 2009 years and the apparent cumulative K budget (kg \u00adha [\u22121] ) of both the Control and NPS treatments. For the apparent cumulative K budget, treatment with two levels (Control and NPS),\nand the crop number with 12 (La Blanca, La Hansa) and 13 (Balducchi and San Alfredo) levels (2000\u20132008)\nand their interactions were considered the fixed factors while the block was considered as random. For topsoil\n\u00adNH 4 OAc-K, treatment with two levels (Control and NPS), year with three levels (2000, 2004 and 2009) and their\ninteractions were considered as fixed, while block was considered as random. In both cases, a mixed effect model\nwith repeated measures over time was applied using the _nlme_ \u00adpackage [56] of the R \u00adsoftware [57] . Additionally, the\nrelationship between the \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K with the apparent cumulative K budgets (2000, 2004 and 2009) was tested\nwith a simple linear regression model by pooling data from all four locations.\nFor the second hypothesis, \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K contents (g \u00adm [\u22122] ) were considered to evaluate the\nagricultural footprint (Pristine, Control and NPS in 2009). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was partitioned\nby location. For vertical distributions of \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K, we applied a mixed effect models with\nrepeated measures over space (soil depth) using the _nlme_ \u00adpackage [56] . Thereby, treatment, soil depth and their\ninteractions were considered as fixed factors, while block was considered as random factor. The fulfillment of\nthe assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance for the K budget, \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K were\nvisually (QQ-plots and Student\u2019s residuals vs. fitted values) and formally evaluated (Shapiro-Wilks normality test).\nFinally, we selected the best models based on the lowest scores for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Means\nand significant interactions were obtained using the LSMEAN/PDIFF procedure using the _emmeans_ \u00adpackage [58] .\nFor the third hypothesis, regression analyses were executed to estimate the effect of soil texture (clay, silt\nand sand -%-) and pristine K richness (Pristine \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K and \u00adNaBPh 4 -K) on the depletion of \u00adNH 4 -OAc-K\nand \u00adNaBPh 4 -K. A stepwise selection was applied using the _stepAIC_ function from the MASS \u00adpackage [59] to define\nthe most relevant variables linearly associated with both depletions. Once variables were selected, partial linear\nand linear-plateau relationships were further tested for interpretation purposes using the _stats_ package v3.6.2 [57] .\n\n\nReceived: 14 January 2021; Accepted: 10 May 2021\n\n\n**References**\n1.

It is crucial for the efficient use of K resources,\n\nfood security and resource sustainability to realize soil K balance status in China. Therefore,\n\ntemporal and spatial changes of K balance for farmland in China from 1980 to 2015 were\n\nanalyzed at national and regional levels using statistical data and related parameters. At the\n\nnational scale, K input increased from 6.78 Mt K 2 O in 1980 to 23.44 Mt K 2 O in 2015 with an\n\naverage annual increment of 0.48 Mt K 2 O, and output changed from 8.10 Mt in 1980 to\n\n21.31 Mt in 2015 with an average annual increment of 0.38 Mt K 2 O as well. On average, K\nbalance was -24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,\n\nrespectively. Moreover, the average balance of six regions was considerably different which\nwere -21.37, 1.25, 13.70, -22.79, 99.22 and 7.18 kg K 2 O ha [-1] from 1980 to 2015. The potas\nsium use efficiency (KUE) decreased with time which were 127.09, 104.35, 87.69 and\n\n89.69% in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively, and the decline of slope could also\n\nreflect the variation tendency of KUE. Great variation of K balance across different regions\n\ndemonstrated that fertilizer application and management practices need to be adjusted to\n\nlocal conditions.\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nLow soil fertility is one of the main constraints of agricultural productivity, so enhancing soil\nfertility is the basis for guaranteeing food security [1, 2]. The recommended means of improving soil fertility is by regulating farmland nutrient cycles and balance through rational fertilization [3]. Balanced fertilizer application can not only save resources, but also improve\neconomic benefits. Nutrient balances (also known as nutrient budgets) are calculated by the\ndifference between nutrient inputs and outputs of a system with predefined spatiotemporal\nboundaries [4]. Thus, they are generally expressed as an amount of nutrient per unit of area\n\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 1 / 17\n\n\n1610132016011).

Negative nutrient balances indicate that a system is losing nutrients,\nhowever in some cases, nutrients apparently accumulate (and might lead to nutrient losses if\nstrongly in excess). Nutrient balances have been used extensively for improving natural resource\nmanagement and/or for recommendations over the last decades [5\u20139]; they are useful tools as\nindicators of potential land degradation and for optimizing nutrient use in agricultural systems\nto maintain sustainability of soil nutrient resources and agricultural production [10, 11]. Therefore, maintaining the balance between plant nutrient inputs and outputs in agroecosystems has\nbecome very important for sustainable development and soil quality [12, 13].\nTo provide enough food for the continuously growing population in China, large quantities\nof fertilizers, mainly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers, have been used in agriculture\n\n[3, 14]. However, potassium (K), an essential element for crops, has often been neglected [15].\nPotassium deficiency is a global problem [16] and there have been huge changes in soil K all\nover the world, from Europe [17, 18] to Africa [19, 20] to Asia [21, 22], and North America\n\n[23]. China suffered a serious soil K deficiency from 1961 to 1997 [24]. Liu et al. [25] indicated\nthat soil K had been a limiting factor for sustainable agricultural production especially in some\nparts of northeast and north-central China. In recent years, soil K deficiency has been relieved\nwith the increase in fertilizer K application and straw return. Shen et al. [13] indicated that\nalthough the soil K balance was deficient in the period from 1993 to 2001, the situation was\nimproved from 1999 to 2001. Several studies also showed that significant soil K surpluses were\nobserved in vegetable production in Hebei [26], Shandong [27] and Jiangsu provinces [3].\nPrevious studies about K balance have mainly focused on specific experimental sites [15,\n28\u201331] or short-term observations at national level [32], but it is difficult to show in-depth\nanalysis of element balances based on specific experimental sites or one-year studies [3].\nAlthough a negative K balance might not occur in the short term, long-term negative K balance is still a potential problem [33]. Because nutrient balances can vary considerably from\nyear to year, short-term studies providing limited information might be misleading [24]; Sheldrick et al. [24] also emphasized the importance of using nutrient balances at the national level\nwhich would help to develop national fertilizer policies including decisions on investments in\nfertilizer factories and the exploitation of local resources and minerals to supply nutrients.\nInformation on temporal variability of K balances in agroecosystems at the national level\ncould be of great benefit for policymakers and farmers in finding strategies and measures for\nreasonable use of K resources to ensure food security [13], as described in previous studies [24,\n34\u201336].\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the temporal and spatial variation in K balances\nand K use efficiency in China from 1980 to 2015. The results will help to identify regions with\npoor soil fertility and assist in putting forward strategies by rational nutrient management to\nimprove low-yielding field.\n\n\n**Materials and methods**\n\n\nStudy area\n\n\nBased on 31 provincial data sets, gross soil K balance was calculated in mainland China excluding Hong Kong and Macao. China is divided into six regions according to geographical locations and China\u2019s administrative divisions, as shown in S1 Table [32, 37].\n\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe data used in this paper, such as chemical fertilizer, livestock numbers, crop yield, population number living in the countryside, planting area and cultivated land area, were obtained\nfrom the China Agriculture Statistical Report [38].\n\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 2 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\nIn this study, data pre-processing primarily included original data verification. The former\nsteps included filling in the missing data, data validation and derivative data construction.\nAfter that, a reasonable database was built, which included provincial K balance data from\n1980 to 2015. For the sake of analysis, we compared the K balance across four decades: 1980s\n(1980\u20131989), 1990s (1990\u20131999), 2000s (2000\u20132009) and 2010s (2010\u20132015).\nBecause of the enormous amount of data in the original database, it was difficult to identify\nthe flawed data. Therefore, a strict rule was applied for those indicators: the data from adjacent\nyears could not vary by more than 15%. The missing data could be filled in either by referring\nto a statistical yearbook/published literature or by using the data from adjacent years. However, some indicators that did not exist in the original database needed to be acquired from\nother indicators. For example, the amount of straw is a required indicator, but it can only be\ncalculated by multiplying grain crop production by a literature survey-based conversion factor\n(the ratio of grain to straw), which is distinguishing for different crops. The parameters needed\nin this model for K balance calculations in Chinese farmland were explained in Liu et al. [39];\nspatial variation of parameters was estimated by region.\n\n\nSoil K balance model description\n\n\nThe soil K balance model included the following inputs: chemical fertilizer, organic manure,\natmospheric dry and wet deposition, irrigation and crop seeds (K 2 O, similarly hereinafter)\n\n[39]. In detail, the organic fertilizer resources were categorized by human and animal manure,\nstraw and cake manure. The following outputs were used: crops removal (including grain and\nstraw uptake) and nutrient loss (leaching and runoff loss).\n**Chemical fertilizer inputs.** The ratio for K 2 O in compound fertilizer was different in different regions and years, as shown in S1 Table [32, 37].\n**Organic manure inputs.** The organic manure resources mainly include human and livestock manure, straw return and cake manure. The human and livestock manure including the\nparameters of livestock feeding period, daily excretion, K 2 O content and application rates to\nfield were listed in Table 1 [39\u201341]. The quantity of crop straw was calculated through grain\nyields and the ratio of grain to straw for each type of crops and the K contents in straw were\ncollected from published studies (Table 2) [42]. The rates of straw return to fields in the 2000s\nand 2010s were published in Li and Jin [32] with 15% in NE and NW, 60% in NC and 30% in\nthe MLYR, SE and SW. In the 1980s and 1990s, the crop straw was removed from fields and\nreturned back into the soil with burned ashes to different extents. The straw return rates in the\n\n1980s were about 1/3 of those in the 2000s, (5% in NE and NW, 20% in NC and 10% in the\nMLYR, SE and SW). In the 1990s, the straw return rate was 2/3 of those in the 2000s, (10% in\nNE and NW, 40% in NC and 20% in the MLYR, SE and SW). The cake production rate of different crops and the K content in cake manure were collected from published data (S2 Table) [39].\n**Other inputs.** In addition to chemical fertilizer and organic manure, atmospheric dry\nand wet deposition, irrigation and crop seeds were analyzed as sources of farmland nutrients\n(S3 Table).\n**Arable crop outputs.** The amount of arable crop outputs was the principal nutrient output in the agricultural system which was calculated through economic yield and K requirement\nfor unit of economic yield of different crops (Table 3) [32, 39]. The arable crop outputs were\ncategorized into five kinds of crops, including cereal crops, fruit and vegetables (fruit, vegetable\nand melons), oil crops (oil crops and beans), industrial crops (sugar beet, sugar cane, fiber\ncrops, cotton and tobacco) and root crops (sweet potato and potato).\n**Leaching and runoff outputs.** Few reports have been published quantifying accurate\namounts of K 2 O leaching and runoff outputs. This type of output only accounted for a small\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 3 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\n**Table 1.

The K outputs all increased significantly over the past four\ndecades except for NE which increased from the 1980s to the 1990s, but it didn\u2019t change from\nthe 1990s to the 2010s. The MLYR and SE had large K outputs which were 164.86, 207.03,\n224.70, 248.69 and 153.57, 210.03, 237.98, 266.09 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and\n2010s, respectively. Additionally, the NE and NW had the lowest K outputs with values of\n70.97, 97.27, 93.85, 99.63 and 47.70, 71.71, 88.56, 124.03 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s\nand 2010s, respectively (Fig 4).\nThe composition of K output at the regional level differed among regions, which was\nrevealed by the negative values (Fig 4). The main K output source was cereals crops, which\nincreased over time for all regions except for SE. As for the other output sources, the K output\nfrom fruit & vegetables and oil crops accounted for a larger part for all regions except for SE in\nwhich the larger sources of K the output were fruit & vegetables and industrial crops.\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation in K balance\n\n\n**Temporal variation in K balance in China.** At the national scale, the average K balance\nfrom 1980 to 2015 was 0.81 kg K 2 O ha [-1] yr [-1] . K was deficient from 1980 (-1.33 Mt K 2 O) to\n1997 (-0.10 Mt K 2 O), but this condition was gradually alleviated from 1984 (-3.23 Mt K 2 O) to\n1995 (0.67 Mt K 2 O). After that time, the K balance reached a slight surplus and remained relatively stable from 2003 (2.74 Mt K 2 O) to 2015 (2.13 Mt K 2 O) (Fig 1A). On average, K balance\nincreased by -24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,\nrespectively.\n**Temporal and spatial variation in K balance by regions.** As it was shown in the lie graph\n(Fig 3C), the average K balance in six regions from 1980 to 2015 varied widely with values of\n-21.37, 1.25, 13.70, -22.79, 99.22 and 7.18 kg K 2 O ha [-1], respectively. The annual K balance\nshowed different trends in six regions (Fig 3C). The K balance in the SE moved into surplus\nfrom 1985 onwards, while the K balance in NE remained in the negative changing from -25.44\nkg K 2 O ha [-1] in 1980 to -11.90 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in 2015. Additionally, other four regions all reached\nbalance by 2002. In detail, the balance in the SE increased from 1980 to 2005 (186.88 kg K 2 O\nha [-1] ) even though the K balance had a short term decrease from 1995 to 1998; after 2005 it\nremained relatively stable to 2015 (202.29 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ). In addition, the balance in the NW\nwas slightly in surplus and remained relatively stable from 1980 (32.02 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to 2015\n(8.21 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ). The balance in the NC and SW was negative from 1980 (-16.53 and 3.74 kg\nK 2 O ha [-1], respectively) to 1993 (-5.33 and -6.66 kg K 2 O ha [-1], respectively) and in the MLYR\nfrom 1980 (-43.23 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to 2001 (-3.62 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ), after which they were all in surplus\nuntil 2015 (9.45, 31.26 and 15.94 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in NC, SW and MLYR, respectively).

Potassium balance in agricultural land in six regions in 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.**\n\n\n[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156.g006](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156.g006)\n\n\nsummarize, the negative stage of K balance could be divided into two stages: firstly a decrease\nand then an increase.\n\nThe average K balance in SE was the largest and had a distinct increase over time with values of -1.53, 72.58, 167.40 and 197.91 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. However, the K balances in NE and MLYR were significantly lower than those in other\nregions with values of -30.72, -30.18, -9.25, -11.29 and -69.41, -37.74, 13.14, 19.91 kg K 2 O ha [-1]\n\nin the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively; NE stayed in deficit for the entire period.\nThe K balances in NE, MLYR, SE and SW all increased significantly with time. Although NW\nremained in surplus throughout the study period the values decreased over time with values of\n26.02, 10.60, 9.80 and 4.84 kg K 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s 2000s and 2010s, respectively. At the\nmeantime, the K balance in NC increased from the 1980s (-29.08 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ) to the 2000s\n(22.64 kg K 2 O ha [-1] ), and then decreased dramatically between the 2000s and the 2010s (10.72\nkg K 2 O ha [-1] ) (Fig 6).\n**Temporal and spatial variation of KUE.** Average KUE in China from 1980 to 2015 was\n103.60%. During the past four decades, the KUE decreased with values of 127.09, 104.35, 87.69\nand 89.69% (Table 4), and the decline in the slope could also reflect the KUE (Fig 7). However,\ngreat variation in KUE existed across different regions with mean values of 138.63, 107.28,\n83.02, 121.65, 73.97 and 97.22% for NE, NC, NW, MLYR, SE and SW, respectively (Table 3).\n\n\n**Table 4.

Each point respected a\nprovince. The red line meant 1:1 line.\n\n\n[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156.g007](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156.g007)\n\n\nThere was a positive linear correlation between K input and K output in crops with the correlation coefficients (R [2] ) of 0.41, 0.70, 0.83 and 0.80 for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s,\nrespectively (Fig 7). The balanced condition could also be found according to the 1:1 line,\nwhich was divided into two parts. Left part of the 1:1 line represented K deficit, which meant\nthat the K output was larger than the K input. On the contrary, right part of the 1:1 line represented K surplus which meant that the K input was larger than the K output. If the points were\naround the line, it meant that the K in some places had reached to a balance stage. Additionally, data points in the 1980s were scattered largely above and below the 1:1 line while more\ndata points in the 1990s aggregated around the line; more data points were below the line in\nthe 2000s and 2010s.\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variability in the K balance\n\n\nThere was great spatial variation for K input and output which was correlated with the different crops and soil fertility [30, 43]. Results in this study indicated that K input and output\nincreased dramatically with time. The K input kept increasing as the use of chemical fertilizer\nincreased year by year, whereas the K output also continued to increase because of the increase\nin crop yield and change of K output from different crops. For example, the proportion of K\nremoval in output for cereals crops (low K uptake) decreased from 70.2% to 55.8%, but it\nincreased from 8.7% to 24.1% for fruit & vegetables (high K uptake) in the past four decades.\nHowever, the input and output in the NW were lower over the past four decades than those in\nother regions because of the low chemical K fertilizer application and low crop yields [43, 44].\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 12 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\nOn one hand, over-reliance on the imported K fertilizer and the increasing cost limited the use\nof K fertilizer [13, 24, 45]. On the other hand, some farmers believed that N and P application\nplayed a more important role in increasing crop yield than K fertilizer [46] because the application of K fertilizer does not produce results as quickly as N and P fertilizer application; this is\nbecause of the high soil K supply capacity with high K-containing minerals such as micas and\nfeldspars in the soil parent material [47, 48].\nConversely, the K balance increased steadily, which was mainly attributed to improvement\nof the social economy and improved management among farmer households [3]. For example,\nchemical fertilizer application in the SE increased dramatically with economic development,\nleading to a substantial surplus in the K balance. Another important reason for the improved\nK balance is that more crop residues were returned back to soils with the development of agricultural mechanization [43]. In addition, K balance in the NE was still deficient which indicated that K input in the NE was insufficient to meet crop production. However, the soil\navailable K in NE was stable from the 1990s to the 2000s [43], which implied that the abovementioned K input sources were not the only source of K for crop absorption and that soil K\nmineralization also played a substantial role. In this study, the K balance in the NW was stable\nat the equilibrium state over four decades, but the soil available K decreased from the 1990s to\nthe 2000s [43]. One of the reasons for this might because K was easily fixed with the alternation\nof dry and wet climate conditions [49]; this might result in decreasing K availability because of\nthe slow mineralization of returned straw [50, 51].\n\n\nK fertilization predictions and recommendations\n\n\nThe nutrient balance exhibited a strong relationship with nutrient management and sustainable agricultural development [3], so it was necessary to budget the agricultural nutrient balance on a macro level, especially for policy makers who need to be informed on national\nsituations. The K balance prediction in 2020 was mainly based on the policy of zero growth of\nchemical fertilizer and 60% straw and manure return rates. So far, the crop yield in 2015 was\nthe highest and could be regarded as the optimal level. We assumed that if zero growth of\nchemical fertilizer is achieved by 2020 and crop yields is maintained at the optimal level as\nthose in 2015, the K balance for China will be 76.50 kg K 2 O ha [-1] . Large temporal and spatial\nvariation in the K balance highlighted that fertilizer application and management practices\nneed to be adjusted based on local conditions. For example, the K surplus in the SE was over\n70% in recent years, which demonstrated that the potential for decreasing K fertilizer application in SE was large. Therefore, it is realistic to decrease chemical K fertilization whilst maintaining high and steady yields without increasing cropping areas. Furthermore, reducing the\nrate of K fertilizer applied was effective in reducing K surplus and enhancing the KUE [52].\nThe K fertilizer application could be decreased by 202.29 kg K 2 O ha [-1] to maintain equilibrium\nin the K balance. In contrast, it is essential to apply more K fertilizer timely and efficiently in\nboth NE and NW in order to maintain the soil K balance over the long-term because of the\ndecline in the K supply capacity. Reports indicated that straw return alone was not sufficient to\nmaintain the soil K balance although more crop residues were returned back to soils with the\ndevelopment of agricultural mechanization [47, 53, 54]. Nevertheless, it is necessary to pay\nattention to the rational utilization of organic manure, especially cow urine in the field, and\ncombine it with the same rate of commercial fertilizer in order to alleviate the K deficit [3, 18].\n\nThe K balance in the SE showed a short-term decrease from 1995 to 1998 because of the reduc\ntion in the number of cattle, which indicated that cow urine contributed substantially to the K\nbalance. Certainly, nutrient management recommendations must change with yield levels and\nprofit maximization in crop production systems [55].\n\n\n[PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184156) September 5, 2017 13 / 17\n\n\nTemporal and spatial variation of potassium balance at national and regional levels in China\n\n\nKUE\n\n\nPotassium use efficiency (KUE) is the uptake efficiency defined as the percentage of K input\nthat is recovered as K output in crops [3, 12, 34]. The KUE in China decreased with time\nbecause of increasing K application rate which suggested that the effect of K fertilizer on\nincreasing grain production had diminished [55, 56]. From the distribution of data in Fig 7,\nthe soil K balance in the 1990s in China was the most reasonable period during the past four\ndecades, which was in accordance with the K balance results (-24.17, -5.92, 21.31 and 19.50\nK 2 O ha [-1] in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively). Nevertheless, the K balances went\ninto surplus in several provinces in the 2000s and 2010s, which indicated that K fertilization\nhas deserved more attention with time. However, great spatial variability in KUE existed\nwith values of 138.63, 107.28, 83.02, 121.65, 73.97 and 97.22% in the 2010s for NE, NC, NW,\nMLYR, SE and SW, respectively. The KUE in SE was the lowest because of the overuse of K\nfertilizer.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\nIt is necessary to budget the soil K nutrient balance on the national level, especially for policy\nmakers. The tendency toward N and P surplus and K deficit has been addressed and corrected,\nbut large spatial variation in the K balance in this study highlighted that fertilizer application\nand management practices need to be adjusted depending on local conditions. Well-managed\nfertilizer use can create a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation by increasing food production and reducing soil\ndegradation in nutrient-poor, fragile soils. Increased K fertilizer application has led to a reduction in fertilizer use efficiency in China. There is an urgent need for the government to act\ndecisively on this issue. The effect of K balance on crop yields under different soil fertility\nshould be verified in different soil types in further studies, to continue the application and\nextension of these results. Therefore, K fertilizer management needs to consider the soil K balance so as to build up a soil K pool to guarantee both high yield and high efficiency of K fertilizer. It is hoped that these results will provide a basis for rational K nutrient management in\nthe Chinese agricultural system.\n\n\n**Supporting information**\n\n\n**[S1 Table.
