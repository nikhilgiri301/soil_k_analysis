ACTIVE ENHANCEMENT FRAMEWORK:
Your primary task is to produce an ENHANCED VERSION of the Stage 2A extraction that corrects errors, fills gaps, and enriches under-represented areas with additional context, nuance, and detail from the original paper.

1. SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT IDENTIFICATION:
   Areas requiring enhancement assessment:
   - Shallow quantitative data extraction: Look for measurements, values, or parameters that Stage 2A captured superficially
   - Under-represented methodological detail: Identify analytical methods, sampling protocols, or quality control measures lacking sufficient depth
   - Incomplete temporal characterization: Find seasonal patterns, long-term trends, or temporal dynamics needing more comprehensive description  
   - Insufficient spatial context: Locate geographic, site-specific, or scale-related information requiring enrichment
   - Limited process mechanistic understanding: Identify soil K cycling, plant-soil interactions, or biogeochemical processes needing deeper characterization
   - Basic treatment effect descriptions: Find fertilization, management, or experimental treatment impacts requiring more detailed analysis
   - Missing comparative context: Identify comparisons between treatments, sites, methods, or temporal periods that need enhancement
   - Incomplete uncertainty characterization: Locate limitations, assumptions, or methodological constraints requiring more thorough documentation

2. CONTEXTUAL ENRICHMENT PATTERNS:
   Enhancement approaches for adding flavor and nuance:
   - Quantitative enrichment: Add missing statistical measures, ranges, confidence intervals, or precision indicators from source material
   - Methodological depth: Include detailed procedural steps, analytical conditions, instrumentation specifications, or quality control protocols
   - Temporal richness: Add seasonal variations, inter-annual patterns, measurement frequencies, or temporal relationship details
   - Spatial complexity: Include within-site variability, landscape position effects, soil property interactions, or scaling considerations
   - Process mechanistic detail: Add kinetic information, environmental controls, interaction mechanisms, or process rate descriptions
   - Treatment response complexity: Include dose-response relationships, interaction effects, temporal response patterns, or mechanism explanations
   - Comparative analytical depth: Add statistical comparisons, effect size quantifications, or relative performance assessments
   - Uncertainty quantification: Include measurement precision, methodological limitations, assumption impacts, or confidence characterizations

3. ENHANCEMENT QUALITY STANDARDS:
   Requirements for systematic enhancement:
   - Source fidelity: All enhancements must derive directly from the original paper text, tables, or figures
   - Scientific accuracy: Enhanced content must maintain rigorous scientific accuracy and appropriate uncertainty characterization
   - Contextual preservation: Enhancements must preserve original research context and author intent without external bias
   - Comprehensive coverage: Enhancement must address all identified gaps across quantitative, methodological, temporal, and spatial dimensions
   - Proportional enhancement: Areas with greater research emphasis should receive proportionally more enhancement detail
   - Integration coherence: Enhanced content must integrate seamlessly with existing accurate extraction elements
   - Business relevance: Enhanced content should improve the extraction's value for soil K assessment and decision-making applications

4. ENHANCEMENT VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:
   Systematic verification requirements:
   - Compare enhanced sections against original text for completeness and accuracy
   - Verify all added quantitative data can be traced to specific source locations
   - Check that enhanced methodological detail reflects actual researcher protocols
   - Confirm temporal and spatial enhancements preserve original study scope and design
   - Validate that process descriptions accurately reflect researcher findings and interpretations
   - Ensure treatment effect enhancements maintain appropriate statistical and scientific rigor
   - Assess that enhanced content maintains conservative bias appropriate for scientific applications

5. ENHANCEMENT INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
   Structured integration approach:
   - Correct all identified errors by replacing incorrect information with verified accurate content
   - Enhance existing sections by adding depth, nuance, and detail where Stage 2A was superficial
   - Add missing sections or subsections where Stage 2A omitted important soil K information
   - Reorganize content for improved logical flow and comprehensiveness where appropriate
   - Integrate enhanced content seamlessly with retained accurate elements from Stage 2A
   - Ensure enhanced extraction represents the most complete and accurate soil K characterization possible from the source material

ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS AND EXAMPLES:

1. QUANTITATIVE DATA ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:
   Example enhancement scenarios:
   - Shallow extraction: "K content: 150 mg/kg" → Enhanced: "K content: 150 ± 12 mg/kg (n=16, CV=8%), measured by Mehlich-3 extraction with ICP-OES detection limit 0.5 mg/kg"
   - Basic temporal: "Measured in 2017" → Enhanced: "Measured in autumn 2017 after harvest, representing end of 7th crop rotation cycle in 21-year experiment"
   - Simple spatial: "Two sites" → Enhanced: "Two contrasting sites: Hněvčeves (50°18'46''N, 15°43'3''E, 265 m elevation, Haplic Luvisol) and Humpolec (49°33'16''N, 15°21'2''E, 525 m elevation, Stagnic Cambisol)"

2. METHODOLOGICAL ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:
   Example enhancement scenarios:
   - Basic method: "Mehlich-3 extraction" → Enhanced: "Mehlich-3 extraction: 3.00 g soil + 30 mL multi-element solution (0.02 mol/L CH3COOH, 0.25 mol/L NH4NO3, 0.015 mol/L NH4F, 0.013 mol/L HNO3, 0.001 mol/L EDTA), shaken 5 min, analyzed by ICP-OES Agilent 700"
   - Simple sampling: "Soil samples collected" → Enhanced: "Soil samples collected from 0-30 cm depth, four replications per treatment, air-dried and sieved to ≤2 mm, stored in controlled conditions prior to analysis"
   - Basic QC: "Standard methods used" → Enhanced: "Quality control included method blanks, certified reference materials, and duplicate analyses every 10 samples, with precision typically <5% RSD"

3. PROCESS CHARACTERIZATION ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:
   Example enhancement scenarios:
   - Basic process: "K cycling occurs" → Enhanced: "K cycling involves release from non-exchangeable reserves in 2:1 clay minerals (mica, vermiculite) through root-induced H+ exudation in rhizosphere, creating K-depleted zones driving interlayer K mobilization"
   - Simple interaction: "Plants uptake K" → Enhanced: "Plant K uptake occurs from multiple pools: soil solution (immediate), exchangeable sites (hours-days), and non-exchangeable reserves (weeks-months), with uptake rates varying by soil sorption capacity and moisture status"
   - Basic treatment: "Fertilizer applied" → Enhanced: "Fertilizer applications: FYM applied autumn to potatoes (63.0 t/ha/3-year cycle at Hněvčeves), mineral P+K applied autumn to each crop, mineral N applied spring with split application to wheat (BBCH 21 and 31-32)"

4. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:
   Example enhancement scenarios:
   - Basic comparison: "Sites differed" → Enhanced: "Sites differed significantly: Hněvčeves Kex content 34.6% higher than Humpolec (206 vs 153 mg/kg, p<0.05), attributed to higher CEC (116 vs 90 mmol+/kg) and different parent materials"
   - Simple treatment effect: "Manure increased K" → Enhanced: "Manure increased exchangeable K significantly: FYM 1 treatment resulted in positive K balance (+856 kg/ha at Hněvčeves, +48 kg/ha at Humpolec over 21 years), while all other treatments showed negative balance (-221 to -2376 kg/ha)"
   - Basic temporal: "K declined over time" → Enhanced: "K declined progressively over 21 years in unfertilized treatments: greatest decline in mineral N treatment (-332 kg/ha Mehlich-3 K at Humpolec), with significant depletion of non-exchangeable reserves at Hněvčeves but not Humpolec due to different parent material K-supplying capacity"

5. CONTEXTUAL RICHNESS ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:
   Example enhancement scenarios:
   - Basic context: "Agricultural study" → Enhanced: "Intensive agricultural system representative of Czech Republic farming: 3-crop rotation (potatoes→winter wheat→spring barley), all crops grown annually, treatments designed to evaluate long-term sustainability of K management approaches"
   - Simple environmental: "Two different soils" → Enhanced: "Contrasting pedological environments: Hněvčeves (Haplic Luvisol on loess, clay loam texture, 8.2°C, 573 mm precipitation) vs Humpolec (Stagnic Cambisol on loess-over-paragneiss, sandy loam texture, 7.0°C, 665 mm precipitation with regular distribution)"
   - Basic integration: "Part of larger study" → Enhanced: "Integral component of long-term soil fertility research program, with K balance calculations incorporating annual yield measurements, plant K content analysis, and fertilizer input tracking, providing comprehensive assessment of K sustainability under different management regimes"

6. UNCERTAINTY AND LIMITATION ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:
   Example enhancement scenarios:
   - Basic limitation: "Some uncertainty exists" → Enhanced: "Key limitations include: K balance calculations exclude subsoil K contributions and atmospheric deposition, soil samples from spring barley plots only may not represent full rotation effects, and non-exchangeable K measurements may not fully capture plant-available fraction"
   - Simple constraint: "Limited sampling" → Enhanced: "Temporal sampling constraints: soil analysis only at start (1996) and end (2017) of experiment limits understanding of intermediate K dynamics, while spatial sampling at 0-30 cm depth may miss deeper K mobilization patterns"
   - Basic assumption: "Assumptions made" → Enhanced: "Critical assumptions in K balance calculations: crop K uptake represents total K removal from soil system, K inputs from organic materials estimated from average composition data, and K fixation-release processes assumed to be in steady state over 21-year period"

ENHANCEMENT INSTRUCTION PRIORITY:
Your enhanced extraction should prioritize:
1. Correcting all identified numerical, methodological, and contextual errors
2. Adding quantitative precision where Stage 2A provided only general values
3. Enriching methodological detail with specific protocols, conditions, and quality control measures
4. Enhancing temporal and spatial context with specific timing, frequency, and location details
5. Deepening process characterization with mechanistic understanding and controlling factors
6. Strengthening comparative analysis with statistical significance and effect magnitude quantification
7. Enriching environmental and experimental context with comprehensive site and treatment characterization
8. Enhancing uncertainty characterization with specific limitations, assumptions, and measurement constraints

The enhanced extraction should represent the most complete, accurate, and contextually rich soil K characterization possible from the source material, suitable for scientific applications in soil K assessment and agricultural decision-making.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: The "enhanced_soil_k_extraction" section is your PRIMARY DELIVERABLE. This must be a complete, corrected, and enhanced version of the Stage 2A extraction that incorporates all identified corrections and enhancements. The validation sections serve to document your enhancement process, but the enhanced extraction is the main output that will be used for scientific applications.

Your validation must ensure the soil K extraction maintains the highest standards for scientific accuracy while faithfully preserving the original research context.
