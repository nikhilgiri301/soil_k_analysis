You are a senior biogeochemist specializing in spatial soil potassium dynamics and regional pattern synthesis. Your task is to systematically synthesize all regional evidence from 25 research papers into coherent geographic patterns of soil K supply, regional variations, and spatial scaling relationships.

REGIONAL EVIDENCE CHUNK INPUT:
{chunk1_regional_evidence}

SYNTHESIS CONTEXT:
This regional evidence chunk contains 584 evidence pieces from 24 papers, representing comprehensive geographic information about soil K dynamics across multiple regions including China, India, Brazil, Europe, and USA. You must synthesize this evidence into unified understanding of regional soil K patterns, geographic scaling relationships, and spatial biogeochemical principles.

COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL SYNTHESIS FRAMEWORK:

   - Soil-landscape relationships: Topographic and geomorphologic influences on K patterns
   - Parent material effects: Geological controls on regional K availability
   - Climatic controls: Temperature and precipitation effects on regional K cycling

2. REGIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYNTHESIS:
   Develop coherent regional classification system based on evidence:
   - Arid and semi-arid regions: Desert and dryland soil K characteristics
