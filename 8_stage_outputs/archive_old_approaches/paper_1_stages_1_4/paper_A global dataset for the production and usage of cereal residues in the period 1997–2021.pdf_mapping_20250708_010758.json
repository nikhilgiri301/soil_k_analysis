It mentions 'nutrient retention' and 'nutrient leaching' broadly but does not provide any specific data, measurements, or detailed discussion related to soil potassium (K) pools, dynamics, or extraction methods. The extraction accurately reflects this absence of K-specific information by marking relevant fields as 'N/A' or leaving them empty. Therefore, the extraction is scientifically accurate, complete, and faithfully preserves the original research context regarding soil K."
