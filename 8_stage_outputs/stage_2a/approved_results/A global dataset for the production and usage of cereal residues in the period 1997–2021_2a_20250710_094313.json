The dataset estimates total production of residues and the fraction used for livestock feed/bedding, burnt on the field, used for other off-field purposes, and left on the field. The dataset aims to improve assessments of environmental impact (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient leaching) and evaluate trade-offs between management options.",

Crop residue production was estimated using three methods (residue production ratios, exponential yield dependence, linear yield dependence). On-field burning was estimated using two datasets (GFED4s, FINNv2.5). Ruminant feed usage was estimated using three sources (Herrero et al., Mekonnen and Hoekstra, Mottet et al.). An ensemble of 18 possible combinations of input data was used to define uncertainty. The remainder of residues after accounting for burning, animal usage, and other off-field uses was assumed to be left on the field, with certain minimum/maximum limits imposed.",
