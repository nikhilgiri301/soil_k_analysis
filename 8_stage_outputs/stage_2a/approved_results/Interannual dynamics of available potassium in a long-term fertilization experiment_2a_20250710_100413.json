Hněvčeves: 265m altitude, 8.1°C average annual temperature, 597mm average annual precipitation. Interannual weather fluctuations were found to be of low significance for available K variability.",
      "agricultural_context": "Polyfactorial long-term fertilization experiments established in 1980. An 8-year crop rotation was used, including 50% cereals, potato/sugar beet, silage maize, and clover/alfalfa. Fertilization included K muriate and farmyard manure (FYM) at various application rates.",
      "study_design": "Polyfactorial field experiments using a central scheme of the second order design in incomplete blocks. Each site had four fields, each with 56 plots (5 × 12 m). Six independent factors (N, P, FYM, K, stand density, Mg, lime) were tested at five levels (zero, lower, medium, higher, excess). The majority of treatments were replicated four times.",
      "temporal_scope": "Experiments initiated in 1980. Data presented and discussed primarily from 1980–1992 for K balance and available K dynamics within a crop rotation cycle. Long-term trends were calculated using data points up to 2007 (e.g., 1983, 1988/1991, 1995/1999, 2007).",
      "spatial_scope": "Originally established at 9 sites, with data presented mainly from Hněvčeves. Each site comprised four experimental fields, with 56 plots per field. Soil samples were taken from the plough horizon (0–20 cm) within plots."
