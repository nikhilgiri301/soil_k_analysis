      "study_objectives": "1) To evaluate the nonexchangeable K release from important benchmark soils varying in mineralogy, K status, and also in relation to soil depth and extraction media; 2) to evaluate different mathematical models for describing nonexchangeable K release and to find whether their performance varies with mineralogical composition of soils, soil K status, and extraction media; and 3) to examine the relationship of K release rates obtained in the kinetic studies with conventional soil test measures of K.",
      "soil_k_research_role": "The study is entirely focused on soil potassium, specifically the release kinetics of its nonexchangeable fraction, which is crucial for plant nutrition.",
      "geographic_setting": "Six major benchmark soil series of India, occurring widely in intensively cultivated regions across six states: Kamliakheri (Indore, Madhya Pradesh), Noyyal (Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu), Lukhi (Gurgaon, Haryana), Rarha (Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh), Kodad (Nalgonda, Andhra Pradesh), and Vijayapura (Bangalore, Karnataka).",
      "environmental_conditions": "Soils varied in pH (acidic to alkaline), CaCO3 content, organic carbon, CEC, and dominant clay mineralogy (smectitic, illitic, kaolinitic).",
      "agricultural_context": "The study is motivated by the significant contribution of nonexchangeable K to plant K nutrition (up to 90-95% of total plant K uptake under intensive cropping) and the reported lack of crop responses to applied K even in soils with low exchangeable K. Subsoil K contribution is also highlighted as substantial for crop nutrition.",
      "study_design": "Laboratory kinetic study using Ca-saturated soil samples. Nonexchangeable K release was measured over time using different chemical extractants. Mathematical models were applied to describe the release kinetics.",
