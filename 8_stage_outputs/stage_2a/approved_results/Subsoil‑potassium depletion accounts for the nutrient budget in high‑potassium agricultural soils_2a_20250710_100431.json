      "study_objectives": "To evaluate the sensitivity of soil-K to K budgets, quantify soil-K changes over time along the soil profile, and identify soil variables that regulate soil-K depletion. Hypotheses tested: (1) topsoil NH4-OAc-K is not sensitive to identify short-medium term K depletion trends in high native K soils; (2) vertical distribution patterns of both NH4-OAc-K and NaBPh4-K are affected by agricultural footprint, with significant depletion beyond topsoil (0–20 cm); and (3) soil K deviates from pristine conditions depending on soil factors related to K buffer capacity (soil texture, indigenous K richness).",
      "soil_k_research_role": "Soil potassium is the primary subject of investigation, with a focus on its various pools, vertical distribution, depletion rates, and the factors influencing its availability and cycling under agricultural management.",
      "geographic_setting": "Pampas region, East-Central Argentina, specifically the Southern Santa Fe region. Four on-farm trials were conducted.",
      "environmental_conditions": "Temperate climate with annual mean temperature varying from 15 to 25 °C. Rainfall pattern is humid to the East and semi-arid to the West.",
      "agricultural_context": "Main crops are maize, soybean, and wheat. Historically, K fertilizer applications have been negligible due to high native soil K. Continuous K removal via harvest is gradually depleting soil K. Cropping systems included maize–wheat/double-cropped soybean (M-W/DS) and maize-full-season soybean-double-cropped wheat/soybean (M-FS-W/DS). No-tillage systems are mentioned as enhancing K stratification.",
      "study_design": "Four on-farm trials with a randomized complete block design and three replicates. Plot sizes were 25–30 m wide and 65–70 m long. Treatments included Control (no fertilizer), NPS (N, P, S fertilizers), and Pristine (adjacent uncultivated soil).",
      "temporal_scope": "Nine years (2000 to 2009). Soil samples were collected in early spring in 2000, 2004 (0–20 cm), and 2009 (0–100 cm).",
      "spatial_scope": "Four experimental sites (Balducchi, San Alfredo, La Blanca, La Hansa) differing in soil properties and management history. Soil profiles were sampled at five depths: 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100 cm."
