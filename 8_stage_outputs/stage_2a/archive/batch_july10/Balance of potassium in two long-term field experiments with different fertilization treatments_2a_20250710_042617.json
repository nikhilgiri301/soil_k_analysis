Six fertilization treatments were applied: Control (no fertilization), Farmyard manure (FYM 1), Half dose of farmyard manure + mineral N (FYM 1/2), Mineral nitrogen (N), Mineral NPK (NPK), and Straw of spring barley + mineral N (N + ST).

      "relationship_to_other_measurements": "Soil K measurements are directly linked to crop K uptake and yield data to calculate K balances. Soil K content is correlated with different extraction methods. Soil properties (texture, pH, CEC, Corg) and climatic conditions are used to explain differences in K dynamics between sites.",
      "integration_with_plant_studies": "Plant K content and crop yields are crucial components of the K balance calculation and are used to assess the efficiency of K recovery from different fertilizers. The study highlights how crop uptake drives K depletion in the absence of sufficient K fertilization.",

      "comparative_context": "Results are compared with findings from other long-term experiments globally (e.g., Bad Lauchstadt, Rothamsted) and within Europe regarding K content, uptake, and balance, validating the observed trends and placing them in a broader scientific context.",
      "literature_positioning": "The study builds upon existing knowledge of potassium biogeochemistry, including the roles of exchangeable and non-exchangeable K pools, K fixation by clay minerals, and the impact of different fertilization strategies on soil K dynamics."
