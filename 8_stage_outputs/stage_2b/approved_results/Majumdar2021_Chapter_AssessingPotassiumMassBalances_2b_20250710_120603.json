      "validator_notes": "The Stage 2A extraction was exceptionally well-done for a review chapter, capturing a vast amount of synthesized information on soil K biogeochemistry across global scales. Only minor corrections related to parameter naming and data structuring were necessary to achieve near-perfect scientific accuracy and machine readability. The context preservation is excellent, and the completeness is high given the nature of the source document (a review rather than a primary experimental paper)."
