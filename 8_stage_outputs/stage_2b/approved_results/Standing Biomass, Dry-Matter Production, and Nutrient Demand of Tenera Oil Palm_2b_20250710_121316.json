Therefore, 'soil K' information is often inferred from plant K dynamics and fertilizer applications. The 'soil K' parameters in the prompt were interpreted broadly to include plant K dynamics as they relate to soil K biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling, as this is how the researchers studied and reported the information."

          "Expanded the 'applied_k_rates' in 'experimental_treatments' to include the full range of K fertilizer application rates per palm age from Table 1.",

This makes the extraction more robust for soil K assessment and management decision-making."

The primary correction involved clarifying the K balance calculation, which was ambiguously presented in the original text snippet. Enhancements focused on providing more specific quantitative details (e.g., fertilizer rates) and clarifying the context of plant K concentration data. The lack of full supplementary tables in the provided text snippet limited the ability to verify specific age-group K concentrations, but the extraction accurately reflects what was available."
