Relocating contextual details improved the logical flow and scientific grouping of information. The document's nature as a guidance leaflet rather than a primary research paper means certain experimental details (e.g., specific statistical measures, detailed instrumentation) are inherently absent, and the extraction accurately reflects this. The enhanced version provides a highly complete and accurate representation of the soil K information available in the source."
