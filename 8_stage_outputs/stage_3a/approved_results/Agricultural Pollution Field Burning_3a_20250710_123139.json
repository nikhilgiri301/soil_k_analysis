      "research_scope_authority": "This paper, a policy note/review, authoritatively synthesizes existing global research and data on agricultural field burning, its environmental and health impacts, underlying drivers, and alternative practices. For soil potassium (K), its authority is limited to qualitative discussions of general 'nutrient cycling' and 'nutrient content' within crop residues, inferring K's behavior based on established scientific principles of biomass burning and residue decomposition. It does not present original experimental data or specific quantitative findings on soil K.",
      "methodological_rigor": "As a review, the paper demonstrates good methodological rigor in synthesizing diverse literature and data sources (e.g., FAOSTAT, academic studies). However, it lacks primary experimental or analytical rigor for soil K conclusions, as no direct soil K measurements or specific methodologies for K analysis were conducted or detailed by the authors of this review.",

Therefore, the qualitative implications for soil K are broadly applicable across diverse agroclimatic zones.",
      "temporal_representativeness": "The paper covers temporal trends in burning and Conservation Agriculture adoption over several decades (e.g., 1972-2030 for burning, 1974-2013 for CA). This provides a representative long-term context for understanding the cumulative impacts of practices on soil nutrients, including inferred K dynamics.",

For general quantitative data (e.g., burning rates, CA adoption), values are presented as estimates or aggregated figures from cited sources, without detailed precision metrics (e.g., standard deviations, error bars) from original studies.",

      "literature_positioning": "The paper positions itself as a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature on agricultural pollution from field burning, integrating environmental, health, economic, social, and behavioral aspects.
