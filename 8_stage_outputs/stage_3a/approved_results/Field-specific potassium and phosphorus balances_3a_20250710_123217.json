    "paper_authority": {
      "research_scope_authority": "This paper, a compilation of multi-site, multi-year field experiments, long-term monitoring, modeling studies, and data analyses, provides strong authority on potassium (K) dynamics in intensive rice-based cropping systems across diverse Asian environments and a long-term grassland system in Scotland. Its authority stems from synthesizing a large volume of plot-level observations (>8000 for RIE, 525 for K omission trials) and multi-decadal experimental data (up to 39 years).",
      "methodological_rigor": "The methodological rigor is high, employing randomized block designs, nutrient omission trials, grid-based soil sampling, and advanced analytical techniques (ICP-AES, XRF, XRPD) for comprehensive K pool characterization. The use of the QUEFTS model, validated with extensive datasets, adds robustness to the nutrient efficiency calculations. Quality control measures, such as standardized analysis procedures and exclusion of anomalous data, enhance reliability.",
      "geographic_representativeness": "The soil K findings are highly representative for irrigated rice-based systems across tropical and subtropical Asia, covering diverse agro-climatic regions and soil types (e.g., alluvial, red and lateritic, coastal saline, fluvo-aquic soils). The inclusion of a long-term grass experiment in Scotland extends the representativeness to temperate grassland systems on granitic bedrock-derived soils, providing a comparative perspective on K dynamics in different climates.",
      "temporal_representativeness": "The research demonstrates strong temporal representativeness, integrating data from short-term seasonal dynamics (e.g., K uptake rates in grass cuts) to multi-decadal trends (e.g., 39-year nutrient balance statistics for India, 30-year grass experiment). This allows for robust conclusions on long-term K depletion and sustainability implications.",
      "measurement_precision": "Measurement precision for soil K parameters is generally high, supported by the use of advanced instrumentation (ICP-AES, XRF, XRPD) and standardized laboratory procedures. For instance, XRPD quantification of K-bearing minerals has an uncertainty of X ± 0.35 wt% at 95% confidence, and total K from mineral partitioning agreed with XRF measurements within 10%.",
      "experimental_control": "The paper's authority is bolstered by well-controlled experimental designs, particularly the long-term grass experiment with its randomized block design and distinct K treatments (K0, K65). Nutrient omission trials across Asia provide controlled comparisons of K-deficient versus fully fertilized conditions, allowing for clear assessment of K response and efficiency.",
      "literature_positioning": "The paper is well-positioned within existing soil K knowledge, building upon established frameworks like Site-Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM) and the QUEFTS model. It confirms and refines reciprocal internal efficiency (RIE) values for K in rice, benchmarks K concentrations in irrigation water, and extensively references prior work on K dynamics, depletion, and mineral weathering, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of K cycling.",
      "authority_limitations": [
        "While comprehensive, the paper acknowledges that the QUEFTS model's linear portion is valid only up to 60-70% of yield potential, limiting its direct applicability to very high-yielding scenarios.",
        "Quantification of sustainable drawdown limits for partial K maintenance approaches requires further research, indicating a gap in definitive long-term sustainability thresholds.",
        "Uncertainty in K input from irrigation water due to variable concentration and quantity at the field level limits precise field-specific K balance calculations without direct measurement.",
        "The PROFILE model for K weathering rates showed discrepancies with field-based estimates, suggesting limitations in current modeling approaches for complex mineral K release.",
        "Statistical power for the long-term grass experiment (80% to detect 15% yield differences) might miss smaller, but agronomically relevant, treatment effects."
