        "research_scope_authority": "This paper holds strong authority for understanding long-term (21-year) potassium (K) dynamics in the plough layer (0-30 cm) under specific fertilization regimes and crop rotations. Its authority is derived from a well-designed, stationary field experiment conducted across two distinct soil-climatic sites, allowing for robust conclusions on K balance, changes in K fractions (bioavailable, exchangeable, non-exchangeable), and K recovery rates.",
        "methodological_rigor": "The methodological rigor is high, employing established and widely accepted analytical methods for soil K fractions (Mehlich 3, NH4OAc, boiling HNO3) and plant K content (AAS). Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Pearson's correlation coefficient with the Statistica programme (StatSoft Inc. 2015, Tulsa, USA). The long-term nature of the experiment (21 years) and the inclusion of multiple fertilization treatments (organic and mineral) with four replications per treatment enhance the reliability of the findings regarding K sustainability and management effects.",
        "geographic_representativeness": "The findings are geographically representative of temperate agricultural regions, specifically those with Haplic Luvisols on loess (clay loam) and Stagnic Cambisols on loess on paragneiss (sandy loam) in the Czech Republic. The two sites offer valuable comparative insights into K behavior across differing soil properties (texture, CEC, pH, mineralogy) and climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation). While specific to these sites, the principles of K dynamics and management implications can be broadly applied to similar intensive farming systems in Central Europe.",
        "temporal_representativeness": "The 21-year study duration (1996-2017) provides excellent temporal representativeness for assessing long-term trends in soil K pools and balances. It captures the cumulative effects of continuous fertilization practices and crop removal over multiple crop rotations, which is crucial for understanding soil fertility sustainability. However, the limited soil sampling frequency (only at the beginning and end of the period) restricts detailed analysis of seasonal or inter-annual K dynamics.",
        "measurement_precision": "Measurement precision for soil K parameters is generally reliable, utilizing modern analytical instrumentation (ICP-OES, AAS) and established extraction protocols. The high correlation between Mehlich 3 and NH4OAc methods (R=0.989, 0.958) indicates consistency between these bioavailable/exchangeable K measurements. However, the absence of explicit standard errors or confidence intervals for most mean values in the original text limits a precise quantitative assessment of measurement uncertainty. A notable point is the original paper's Table 5 listing 'Total K extracted by boiling HNO3' in 'mg K/ha', which was inferred and corrected to 'mg K/kg' in the extraction based on context and numerical consistency with soil concentrations.",
        "experimental_control": "The study exhibits strong experimental control through its stationary field experiment design with fixed crop rotation and six distinct, long-term fertilization treatments, including an unfertilized control. This allows for direct attribution of observed changes in soil K to specific management practices, providing high experimental authority for the studied conditions.",
        "literature_positioning": "The paper is well-positioned within existing soil K knowledge, building upon established methodologies for K extraction and contributing to the understanding of K balance, non-exchangeable K dynamics, and K utilization efficiency. It benchmarks its findings against other prominent long-term field experiments (e.g., Rothamsted, Bad Lauchstadt) and integrates theoretical frameworks on K release from clay minerals and rhizosphere processes, reinforcing its scientific relevance.",
        "authority_limitations": [
          "The study primarily focused on the plough layer (0-30 cm), not fully accounting for potential K mobilization from deeper subsoil layers, which can be a significant K source for plants and influence overall K balance interpretation.",
          "Soil samples for K changes were only taken at the beginning (1996) and end (2017) of the 21-year period, limiting the ability to analyze intermediate temporal trends or seasonal variations in K pools.",
          "While the CAT extraction method was used, the paper itself notes its limited suitability for 'ordinary agricultural soils' compared to garden substrates, suggesting caution in interpreting its results for general soil K availability.",
          "The exact number of experimental plots/replications for treatments is not explicitly stated, only 'four replications' for soil samples, which might affect the perceived statistical power of treatment comparisons.",
          "The high agreement between Mehlich 3 and NH4OAc methods observed in this study might be lower in 'ordinary agricultural soils' compared to these specific long-term field trials, as acknowledged by the authors, limiting the generalizability of this specific methodological comparison."
