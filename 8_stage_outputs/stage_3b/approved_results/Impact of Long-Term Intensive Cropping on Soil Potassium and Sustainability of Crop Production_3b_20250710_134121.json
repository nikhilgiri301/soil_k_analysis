The synthesis covers long-term studies spanning up to 30 years (e.g., 1971-1999), providing robust evidence for long-term trends in soil K dynamics, crop responses, and sustainability implications under continuous intensive cropping.

Superimposed treatments were also implemented to assess specific nutrient responses, providing a strong basis for attributing observed changes to fertilizer management.",
