Detailed analytical protocols, including Ca-saturation of soils to isolate nonexchangeable K, precise time-series measurements, and X-ray diffraction for mineralogical analysis, enhance the reliability of its findings.",

Duplicate samples for kinetic studies further support the reliability of the K release measurements.",

Key variables such as temperature (25°C), soil saturation (Ca-saturated), and extractant concentrations (0.01 M CaCl2, citric acid, HCl) were precisely controlled, allowing for clear attribution of observed K release patterns to soil properties and extractant type.",

In illitic soils, the process is primarily diffusion-controlled, as K must diffuse from the more tightly held interlayer spaces.
