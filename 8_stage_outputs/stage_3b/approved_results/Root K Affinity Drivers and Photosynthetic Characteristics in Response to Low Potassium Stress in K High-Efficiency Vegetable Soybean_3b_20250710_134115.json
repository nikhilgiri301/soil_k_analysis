It employs established and modified protocols for measuring key parameters such as K+ absorption kinetics (Imax, Km, Cmin), root bleeding-sap rate, root vigor (TTC reduction), root absorption activity (methylene blue adsorption), photosynthetic properties (Pn, Gs, Ci, Tr), and chlorophyll content. The experimental designs include appropriate replication and randomization, and statistical analyses (ANOVA, LSD, Pearson correlation) are applied to determine significance.",

While the soil properties are detailed, the findings are not broadly representative of diverse soil types or climatic regions without further validation.",
        "temporal_representativeness": "The temporal representativeness of the soil K findings is constrained by the study duration. The pot experiment covered one growing season (May to full seed stage in 2017), providing insights into K dynamics across key reproductive stages. The hydroponic experiment, however, was short-term (9 days after the first trifoliolate stage), limiting its temporal applicability to seedling responses. Long-term trends or multi-year sustainability implications cannot be directly inferred.",
        "measurement_precision": "Measurement precision is generally good, with quantitative data reported as means of three or five replicates ± Standard Error (SE). Statistical significance is determined at P < 0.05. Specific numerical ranges for various parameters were extracted from figures, enhancing the quantitative detail. Analytical methods like flame spectrophotometry for K concentration and UV-visible spectrophotometry for other parameters contribute to the reliability of the measurements.",
        "experimental_control": "The study exhibits strong experimental control, particularly in the hydroponic setup where nutrient solutions were precisely managed (changed every 3 days, pH adjusted, O2 supplied). The pot experiment also involved controlled fertilizer application and manual pest/weed control, ensuring treatment effects could be attributed primarily to K levels and genotype differences.",

It explicitly references and compares its findings with previous studies on K efficiency in various crops (rice, wheat, sweet potato, tomato, cotton, soybean), highlighting its contribution to understanding specific root and photosynthetic mechanisms in vegetable soybean under K stress.",
