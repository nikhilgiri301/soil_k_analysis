Its scope extends beyond topsoil, providing robust insights into subsoil K depletion and the interplay between K budget, soil properties, and K pool dynamics (exchangeable and slowly-exchangeable K). The inclusion of pristine sites offers a valuable baseline for assessing agricultural impact.",
        "methodological_rigor": "The study demonstrates high methodological rigor through its long-term, multi-site, on-farm experimental design. It employs a mixed-effect modeling approach for statistical analysis, accounting for repeated measures over time and space. The use of two distinct K extraction methods (NH4-OAc-K and NaBPh4-K) provides a comprehensive view of K pools. Assumptions regarding K removal calculations are clearly stated, and statistical significance is rigorously tested (Tukey's HSD, p < 0.05).",

The four study sites were specifically chosen to encompass variations in soil properties (Hapludolls vs. Argiudolls) and management history, enhancing the regional applicability of the conclusions regarding K depletion patterns.",

Annual K budget estimations provide continuous temporal insight. This timeframe is sufficient to observe significant changes in soil K pools under continuous cropping without K fertilization.",

The analytical methods for K (NH4-OAc-K and NaBPh4-K) are standard and well-established, contributing to the reliability of the K parameter measurements.",
        "experimental_control": "The experimental design includes well-defined control treatments (no fertilizer) and a pristine (uncultivated) baseline, allowing for clear attribution of observed K changes to agricultural practices. The NPS treatment isolates the effect of increased yield (and thus K removal) without K fertilization, providing strong experimental control over the K budget.",
