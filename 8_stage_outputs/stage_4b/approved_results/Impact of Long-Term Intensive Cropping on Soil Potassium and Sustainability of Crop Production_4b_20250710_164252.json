          "Parameter evidence mapping: Enhanced precision for 'annual_kg_k2o_per_ha', 'sustainability_years', 'depletion_rate', and 'recovery_potential' by linking to specific quantitative data and clarifying nuances (e.g., depletion vs. release, maintenance vs. recovery).",
          "Regional evidence synthesis: Systematically populated the 'india' section with specific site data mapped to appropriate subcategories (monsoon, dry, himalayan), while explicitly marking other regions (China, Brazil, Europe, USA) as 'no direct evidence' to ensure geographic fidelity. Added a detailed 'regional_context_note' for 'other_regions.general_other' to clarify its broader applicability.",

This transformation of scientific findings into actionable research intelligence directly supports evidence-based understanding of soil K sustainability and agricultural modeling applications, while strictly adhering to geographic and temporal constraints of the source paper."

Confidence levels are appropriately calibrated, reflecting both the strength of the long-term experimental data and the inherent uncertainties (e.g., lack of explicit statistical measures in the review, extrapolation limitations). Strategic relevance assessments are precise, and integration pathways are clearly defined with realistic requirements. Crucially, the mapping strictly adheres to the geographic scope of the source paper (India), avoiding inappropriate extrapolation of quantitative data to non-target regions while still capturing generalizable scientific principles. The identified knowledge gaps and uncertainty characterizations are comprehensive and actionable. The enhanced mapping provides high scientific value for soil potassium biogeochemistry and agricultural modeling applications.",

        "Consider utilizing advanced tools for graphical data extraction from figures (Figures 1-7) within the original paper to quantify trends and specific data points visually represented, which were beyond the scope of this text-based extraction."
