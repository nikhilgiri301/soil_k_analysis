      "enhancement_justification": "The enhancements significantly improve the accuracy of question branch mappings, ensuring data is correctly attributed to its geographic and thematic context. They also provide more precise quantitative characterizations, refine confidence calibrations, and offer more actionable integration pathways. These improvements collectively transform the mapping into a more robust and scientifically rigorous intelligence product, directly supporting evidence-based decision-making for soil K biogeochemistry and agricultural modeling applications."

Critical corrections were applied to question branch assignments, ensuring accurate geographic and thematic alignment of evidence. Confidence calibrations were refined to reflect inherent data limitations (e.g., visual estimation). The enhanced mapping now provides precise quantitative characterizations, actionable integration pathways with clear requirements, and comprehensive uncertainty propagation. This enhanced version is a high-quality, scientifically robust intelligence product that directly supports the client's research objectives in soil potassium biogeochemistry and agricultural modeling.",
