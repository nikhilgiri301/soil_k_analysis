Critical corrections were applied to question branch assignments to ensure precise and scientifically appropriate mapping of evidence, particularly concerning geographic context (UK within Europe) and the nature of temporal/scaling insights. Evidence characterization was enhanced to clearly distinguish between conceptual frameworks/conversion factors and missing numerical data. Integration pathways were refined for greater actionability and clarity. All identified knowledge gaps and uncertainties were accurately characterized and prioritized. The enhanced mapping provides a robust and highly actionable intelligence product, accurately reflecting the source material's contributions and limitations.",
