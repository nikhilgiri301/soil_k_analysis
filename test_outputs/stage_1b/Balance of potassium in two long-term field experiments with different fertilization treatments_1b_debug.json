However, a critical issue was identified where data (Potassium saturation in CEC) was extracted and attributed to a table (Table 4) that is not present in the provided text, indicating a hallucination or reliance on an external, unprovided source. Additionally, a numerical value for a long-term trend was inaccurate, and a statistical significance level was generalized inappropriately. These issues necessitate revision to ensure the highest standard of accuracy and verifiability.",
