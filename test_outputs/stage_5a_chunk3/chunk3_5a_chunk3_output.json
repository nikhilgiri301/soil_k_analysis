Available K levels can fluctuate seasonally, with long-term trends showing depletion in the absence of adequate K fertilization. Anaerobic conditions in flooded paddy fields can influence K release from soil minerals, contributing to K availability, but continuous cropping without K replenishment leads to significant K mining from soil reserves.",
          "anaerobic_k_cycling": "Flooded rice systems promote anaerobic conditions, which can enhance the release of non-exchangeable K from soil minerals, making it available for crop uptake. This is a significant natural K supply mechanism in paddy soils, but it is not limitless and contributes to long-term depletion if not balanced by inputs.",
          "puddling_effects": "While not directly quantified, puddling, a common practice in rice cultivation, can influence soil structure and water movement, potentially affecting K mobility and leaching. The evidence suggests that K dynamics in rice systems are highly sensitive to water management.",
          "water_management_k_implications": "High rainfall and irrigation in rice systems contribute to K leaching losses, particularly in well-drained soils or under conventional tillage. Conversely, irrigation water can also be a source of K input, though its contribution is rarely sufficient to meet crop demand.",

Long-term studies consistently show declining available and non-exchangeable K pools in intensive aerobic cereal rotations, particularly in K-omission plots. K deficits are common, especially in regions with historical under-fertilization.",
          "dryland_k_cycling": "In dryland or semi-arid regions, K dynamics are influenced by rainfall patterns and soil moisture. K leaching can occur during concentrated rainfall events, while K uptake can be limited by water stress. Efficient K management in these systems often involves practices that enhance K retention and availability under variable moisture conditions.",
          "seasonal_k_demand": "Cereal crops exhibit peak K uptake during rapid vegetative growth and grain filling. Meeting these seasonal demands is crucial for optimal yield and quality. Soil K supply during the growing season is critical, and depletion of rapidly available K can lead to significant yield reductions.",

This high demand, coupled with multiple ratoon cycles, makes ratoon K depletion a major sustainability concern.",

Trash blankets return substantial amounts of K (mean 244 kg K2O ha-1) to the soil, mitigating K depletion and contributing to long-term K balance, especially in green cane harvesting systems.",
          "long_rotation_k_dynamics": "Sugarcane's perennial nature and long rotation cycles mean that K dynamics are cumulative over many years.

Different crops in an intercropping system will compete for available K, potentially leading to K stress if supply is insufficient for all components.",
          "complementarity_mechanisms": "The use of cover crops (e.g., ruzigrass in cotton-soybean-maize rotations) demonstrates K complementarity, where deep-rooted species can recover K from subsoil layers and cycle it to the topsoil through residue decomposition, benefiting subsequent or intercropped shallow-rooted species.",
          "system_k_efficiency": "Mixed cropping systems, particularly those incorporating cover crops or diverse rotations, can enhance overall system K efficiency by improving K cycling, reducing leaching, and accessing different soil K pools. This leads to better K retention and utilization compared to monocultures.",

Different crop sequences remove varying amounts of K, and well-designed rotations can help maintain or improve soil K levels by balancing K removal with inputs from residues and fertilizers. Long-term experiments show that rotations with organic amendments can lead to K surpluses.",
          "crop_sequence_k_effects": "Specific crop sequences significantly impact annual K balance. For example, rapeseed-maize rotations show high K deficits (-156.06 kg K2O ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), while rice-wheat rotations can achieve K surpluses (38.04 kg K2O ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) with appropriate management, highlighting the need for rotation-specific K budgeting.",
